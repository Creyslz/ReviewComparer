great for viewing and gaming  not so much on sound    
i ordered this monitor because i wanted to make a makeshift area for my powerful  but old laptop  when i took it out of the box  i was impressed by the size of the screen  it s quite wide and sturdy so you have no fear of it wobbling around  so on to the testing  the hdmi and vga are good for selection  i use hdmi and turned it on  the images are gorgeous  the ips definitely makes the fhd shine thru and thru  images are vivid  movies are amazing  and you have plenty of room to see all of your windows  everything was great    till i switched the sound from my laptop to the monitor  they really dropped the ball there  i have to put the sound up on the monitor and my laptop to even hear anything  i barely have to turn up the sound on my laptop to hear it so i don t know if they put all their money into the screen or decided the speakers were a last minute decision  so if you plan on using this monitor with a tower pc  please have external speakers as your default because the monitor speakers are mediocre  so for those looking for a replacement monitor  a low price ips screen  or a productivity work some gaming screen  i can suggest this to you  those looking for a monitor with minimum fuss to it  i can sortof recommend it to you because it s easy to setup  but i strongly advise you to have external speakers in order to enjoy any sound while being hooked up to this monitor 
for the price  its amazing
the thing to remember with this product is you get what you pay for  i am a second year finance major  and i was looking for an additional monitor to use with my laptop  all i would need it for is spreadsheets  word processing  and internet use  so i didn t need a brand new 4k 34in ultra wide whatever  i just needed a simple cheap monitor that would get the job done  and this did exactly that  no  it doesn t have the best resolution  and no it doesn t have the best color correctness  but you can t compare a  120 monitor to a  1300 monitor  for a college student or home office this in my mind is the best monitor you can get for the money  and i fully intend to get a second one 
sweet monitor  sweet price  but needs instructions to adjust the pic
sweet monitor  i needed a new 24  monitor with an hdmi connector  researched the hell out of monitors  got it narrowed down to a few great deals  then realized that the great deals i selected didn t have height swivel adjustments  which i wanted  best deals with adjustable stands came down to this item and acer vg245h  which has tilt adjustment but not height   so this seemed the most bang for the buck  it s sleek  crystal clear  and bezel is ridiculously thin  picture looked terrible on arrival  way way way too bright   like a tv in  showroom  mode  had to fuss with the picture adjustments a good deal to get it to look like other monitors and get it out  eye burning  mode  i had to turn the brightness down from 80   which is how it was set on arrival  to about 20   i sure wish there had been some readily accessible instructions on how to adjust the picture for optimal viewing instead of relying on trial and error  but no useful instructions were included  nor could i find anything online  i m not talking about color calibration for professional photography or anything like that  just basic instructions appropriate for someone doing word processing  web surfing etc  so docking 1 star for that  include decent instructions for adjusting the screen  or have it pre set for normal home office use   and i d give 5 stars
looks great  solid base  height adjustable  rotation  good but not great image quality
looks great and nice design with thin bezels  solid stand  height adjustment  and rotation  there are claims being made about a swivel adjustment  but i can t get mine to swivel at all unless i pick up the entire thing with stand and move it  which obviously is not a swivel feature  if anyone know how to get this thing to swivel  please comment  i deducted 1 star for image quality  it s good  but not great  i expected better  but maybe at this price  this is as good as it gets  i expected more brightness  although it is decently bright  and for an ips display  i expected the colors to be more vibrant and have more  pop   netflix streaming is downright disappointing on this monitor  maybe it s the built in intel hd graphics on the computer that s to blame  all i know is that i have an asus gaming laptop with an ips display and the image quality blows this monitor away  i also had an older dell desktop with windows xp and an older dell standard  not ultrasharp  lcd monitor and photos looked better on it  brighter  sharper  with better color gradations   so image quality is pretty good but not great or outstanding on this monitor  but it does look really nice and appears to be well made 
a good work monitor 
audio and picture aren t of any high quality  but it can rotate between portrait and landscape without purchasing a  30 mount  only good for a simple work setup 
audio connection problems
since i use an external high quality stereo system for sound  i didn t need the built in sound  however  the default configuration disabled the audio output jack of the computer and used the built in sound without asking  it took me several days of trying different things to shut off the default so i could get my high quality music  this was annoying and i would have chosen another monitor if i had known in advance  other than this  i like the monitor especially the up down adjustment of screen position 
it s great  but not for speaker 
i m happy with my product  however there are some cons  so this is the list of pros and cons  so far  pros  1  everything work great  2  display is beautiful  i love ips display 3  i love how you can rotate 90  as a computer programmer  it is very easy to see every single line of codes  4  you can adjust the height  5  very easy to setup  cons  1  speaker not as great as i thought  yes  i read all reviews before i bought  they all complainted about the speaker  the reason i rated 4 star because my monitor s jack for headphones headset doesn t work  it might be a defective unit  but overall  i love it 
a good option with thin bezels and a tilting display for a perfect viewing angle  works great 
i bought two of these monitors  i selected these for three reasons  1  price  2  amazon s choice  3  my old hp monitors are still going strong after close to ten years  on the oldest   the first day that i used them  one of the monitors had a flicker and what looked like some bad lines  however  i discovered my computer was using a generic driver  so  after downloading and installing the hp driver for these monitors everything looked perfect  there may or may not be better options out there  for the price  i am quite satisfied with what i got  the bezels are really thin as well  so the monitors look very good and have a consistent pictures when butted up against each other  another bonus is that these tilt  which enables you to adjust them for a perfect viewing angle  most monitors in this price range do not tilt  
great otherwise but cable too shot for standard situation
i have only one complaint  the cable for the power transformer is too short  with the monitor placed at the edge of a standard height desk  the heavy transformer dangles in mid air  i ve resorted to placing a box under it  what penny pinching engineering 
nice  not great speakers 
this is a nice monitor  easy to set up  great looking picture  i needed a little bigger view  only down side for me was the sound  it s pretty quiet  partly because the speakers are installed on the back side  not pointing down or toward the front  but away from you  looks great  though  and i m still using it without my other speakers to un clutter my desktop  great shipping with prime as always 
small bezels for small price
this is a very attractive ips monitor  i just wanted a companion monitor for my 2016 macbook pro s internal display  i wasn t expecting quality anywhere near the lg ultrafine and that s more than okay at this price point  setup was easy and it s fairly bright  matte finish that doesn t look bad  the thin bezels help with immersion  not to mention all the features that you get with the stand  i m very impressed considering the price  i don t have the tools to test color reproduction but to be fair  i can tell it s not as good as my macbook pro s internal display but again  i wasn t expecting it to be  the only downside  and your mileage may vary  is that the hdmi cable included didn t work but i have so many laying around 
great monitor  weak speakers 
great monitor  reason for only four stars is the audio  very weak speakers  my laptop i hook up to this screen has louder speakers and sounds better  i did find a volume setting in the onscreen menu  but even maxing the volume only makes a slight difference  other then that its an awesome monitor and has a good picture 
good height adjust feature
received the monitor quicker than i thought even i am not prime member   i like the height adjust feature  the hd screen is bright and nice  it s very thick frame design so the screen size is actually frame size   the base is solid and easy to adjust height to the position you want  good choice for 24 hd 1920 monitor    
good looking monitor 
this is a very good looking monitor  i purchased them for my office and set up three desks with dual monitor set ups  may sound dumb  but i originally chose these monitors because my clients will see the back side of these monitors and they have a very clean  uncluttered  backside  all of the cables plug in to downward facing ports and the monitor base has a hole that the cables can neatly pass through  the screen looks very good as well and your picture runs all the way out to about a 1 4 inch of the outside perimeter of the monitor  i thought this looked much better than some other monitors that had very wide frames around the picture  they have a very sturdy base that keeps the monitors from feeling tippy  and the base has a foam rubber pad that keeps the monitors from sliding on the desk surface  i skipped one star as i thought the speakers were pretty poor  but  for the price point  and what i purchased them for  they work very well  i would recommend them to anyone 
beautiful monitors for my dual monitor set up  speakers could use work
excellent monitor  i purchased 2 to set up a home office  these are beautiful screens  they do have speakers  but they are function but aren t the best quality  if you want to watch a movie or music   something for entertainment  you ll want to rely on an external speaker or your computer s speakers  these will do the job for occasional computer alerts and quick ads or videos  since the speakers weren t a requirement for me  i didn t let them affect my rating considerably 
great screen  poor speaker
nice monitor  good value  looks great  the internal speaker is very  very poor  i got this to use my note8 with a dex  but sound quality is so poor over hdmi  i think the cellphone speaker is actually better   
it also has the option to turn 90 degrees on a swivel 
bought as a 2nd monitor for my set up for watching videos or having internet tabs open while gaming  for only  130 it does the job well and doesn t have any dead pixels  though its only 60hz  i wouldn t recommend it for gaming  it also has the option to turn 90 degrees on a swivel 
he is very happy because he can now see the display without having    
purchased as christmas gift for my 89 year old  slightly visually impaired  dad replacing his 15  computer monitor  he is very happy because he can now see the display without having to magnify the image out of position  lost one star because  although gift receipt packaging was requested  those directions were not followed  but since i had it shipped to my house  i just took the time to  fix it  myself  pulled paperwork   wrapped for christmas  
great monitor  but shipping weight is wrong 
perfect monitor for gamer or developer  the images shows it all  however  please do not believe the shipping weight of the product  i was fooled by it  because it was wrong  it is a big monitor and heavy as well  the product shipping weight is advertise 13 6 pound  but in actuality  the weight is 15 65 pound  7 1 kg   so if you shipping it to somewhere far away  please be aware of the the weight differences  it does come with hdmi cable  which was great attention to user s need  i was disappointed that it did not have turning pivot for left or right  all in all  awesome monitor for its price 
great display  but sub par audio 
the display itself is great  clear and bright  though glare from light can be a bit of a problem  however  the audio is significantly below my expectations  it has way too much of an  echo y  sound to it  making audio a bit of a pain to listen to if you don t have external speakers or headphones 
bought 2 for a dual monitor office set up     
bought 2 for a dual monitor office set up  one of the 2 arrived with a small area of dead pixels  issue did not resolve but amazon sent out a replacement  for office work these seem more than adequate  i took off one star because i am a little worried about longevity considering one of the two arrived with issues 
good height control
the sound is almost nonexistant  good height control  good looking screen resolution  good price 
nice image quality
nice image quality  the height and tilt adjustments are far superior to other models within this price range  as others have mentioned  the embedded speakers are very poor quality and  tinny   i just configured sound settings to use my laptop s speakers instead 
great for the price
this monitor is great especially for  99   price when i bought them  my main monitor prior to buying this was a 24inch 4k samsung  this monitor is pretty good compared other than it being 1080 only  the bezel is really small and are great for a dual monitor set up 
great value for a monitor 
first attempt had dead pixels  the second attempt was perfect  as everyone said  the speakers are crap  but overall the monitor is excellent value for money especially the stand that can go up and down
