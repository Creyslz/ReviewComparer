hard plastic means ear stress
i should point out that the sound quality is fine and the actual appearance of the headphones are quite pleasing  however   the cord is guarded by hard plastic guards right where the earbuds rest between the tragus antitragus   those two bumps of cartilage  this can frequently lead to the ear feeling pressed on or pushed apart unnaturally  in fact  after a week or so of use my ears had quite enough and began to ache whenever i put them on  unfortunately  i require headphones and didn t have the money to replace them again    regrettably  this has culminated in a rather painful sore on the inner side of my right ear s inner bump  the tragus   since they do not fit perfectly due to the thick cord guard  they frequently shift about making this even worse  i really wanted to like these  especially aince they re both nice looking and sound good  but if they re causing discomfort i gotta replace them  again 
good for the kids  or for rough duty
bass challenged  with pronounced sibilance  maybe i should give three stars since they are so cheap but decided two stars since they are so cheap  i can live with the bass somewhat lean  omission rather than commission  but the sibilance robs hfs  like cymbals  of their natural timbre  leaving a spitty ssssssssss sssssssssss sssssssssss noise  i admit i m spoiled by my full sized around the ear planar magnetic cans  good buy for the kids  or to use when you don t want to risk your good buds  just fine for talk radio or baseball fans  someone suggested reports of poor bass may be due to user failure to insert them properly  sorry  no  tonal balance is simply very light  some listeners may mistake sibilance for good detail   just depends to what one is accustomed  they work  you can hear music with them and they re seven bucks at this time  the latter being their strong point  however  they aren t the worst i ve heard  just the most affordable  be forgiving and they ll sound okay
