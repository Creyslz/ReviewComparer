plot twist  it closes itself 
tl dr this came exactly as described  i tried to break this umbrella  i am a tester reviewing this product  and i would have to say this does seem as sturdy as they described  lightweight  compact  also it opens and closes with a button press  construction all the seams are well done and finished so i am not concerned about the fabric  also the fabric is connected around the prongs instead of just stretched over them like a normal umbrella so that is a nice touch  this will last longer than a normal umbrella for that detail alone  this is spring loaded and works with the push of button  all of the metal is solid as well  i tried to make this flip inside out and the umbrella had none of it  travel i like that this is a compact umbrella  when it is closed it is only 11 inches long with fits nicely with a backpack or in a car  even a larger purse could sport it  this also came with a case so if you worried about water getting everywhere you can slide this into its case to be worry free  it is also very lightweight its just a bit over a pound  lb   the fabric on this is water phobic so even if you don t use its case you won t have water all over your stuff  just a quick shake and this is practically dry  in use definitely don t open this with someone right next to it  hold it out in the open because it springs open in like a second  it quickly opens with a press of a button but it also closes itself when you press the button as well which i though was the coolest thing i have ever seen on an umbrella  i didn t know they could do that  you still have to push it down into the handle but most of the work is done for you  the handle is bigger and covered in a soft grip material which feels good in the hand  it also has a strap on the handle to carry it when its not in use  i got my umbrella for free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes  i was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback i may have regarding the product  whether it be positive or negative  i used to think these reviews were fake but now that i actually learned the process it s interesting to know i am allowed to say whatever i want  if i left a really nasty review i still can do these reviews  as long as i explain why i don t like something that is what the company wants from me  all i they ask of me is a review of what i thought about the product  good  bad  meh  its all good as long as i explain why  so just keep that in mind with these reviews  if they are really in depth i would say take these reviews like you would any other one  i do have the product in my hands  i tested it myself  and i can say whatever i think about them  i also get to choose what products i want so i am buying or receiving actual things i liked and picked out myself  just some fyi for you   3
great for the money 
these are great little umbrellas  they perform well and i ve used them for both rain and sun  actually  i sat at a soccer game with two of them propped up behind my head holding off a fierce and beastly storm and they held tough  although the rain was coming in sideways and the wind was blowing something treacherous  they were like a little protective shield for me  the picture is what the storm looked like from my view  you can see the other guys umbrella buckling from facing the terror this mid western deluge  i would recommend after a few months of use 
if you are here reading this    do the right thing and buy it now 
so to start off with this umbrella is awesome  the worry of  as seen on tv  quality was there with an auto open close umbrella but i thought i d give it a shot anyhow  first thought i had was it doesn t rain enough in arizona to do this thing justice  so during a training course in a winter storm in california it was put through the ringer from hard downpour and winds to snow sleet wind mix for days  if it wasn t for my associate borrowing it and then leaving it open to where the winds took it tumbling about a half mile before hitting a fence and bouncing off of metal and muddy objects along the way it wouldn t have needed replacing  all of that and only one arm broke which left the umbrella still useable  just not  100  so i purchased another one as we are moving to a rainy part of the world and it dawned on me that they had a warranty of some sort  yeah yeah    you see it all the time  lifetime warranty blah blah but only if it meets these very specific requirements and you have to pay to ship it back and then pay for the shipping to you with a 24 week turn around     not the case with their customer service  all i did was let them know it broke and i couldn t provide anything short of my original order number as i had discarded the old umbrella  they simply said they apologize and are sending a new one free of charge  excellent product and customer service 
best umbrella i ve ever owned
best umbrella i ve ever had  i bought it after looking online for one that wouldn t fall apart at the first gust of wind in a rainstorm  after using several times in a huge rainstorm with heavy winds  it seems to be indestructible  the strong wind will flip the umbrella inside out  but it quickly flips back and show no sign of being worse for wear  i plan to buy several more so i can be sure to have one at my home  office and car 
great protection and folds up small to take with you 
this is a great umbrella that folds up nice an small  it will be sent with the kids in there backpack for walks home in the rain  this umbrella when folded up is about 11 inches long and 2 5 inches round  it has a nice little bag it fits in when folded up  it weighs about 1lb so it s really light an easy to pack with you just in case the weather changes for the worse  which on the coast it goes from sunny to raining an back again quiet often  to open all you have to do is pull it out of the bag  release the velcro strap  then push the botton  it pops open an ready for use  retracting it is just as easy  just push the botton again an it closes up  you have to push it back down to reset the spring before it wil open again but the auto close is a cool feature  wrap the velcro strap around it an put it back in the bag if you want  it is well made  and it holds up well in the wind  it sheads water really well just like a plastic one would but it feels like fabric  after uses with a little shake it s pretty much dry  the handle is soft rubber and is comfortable in your hand but it is kinda small for a man s hand  it will fit a woman s hand or child hand well  this is my only complaint of this umbrella have a little bigger handle  even if it makes it a little less compact  it comes with a strap for around your wrist  this is a well designed umbrella  for  21 i think this umbrella is worth every penny  it does its job really well  i am happy with it  it s really easy to take with you on the go  don t get caught in the rain without a umbrella  even with the this being really compact while closed it opens up really big that will help even with rain an wind  i will be getting more of these for the kids also  disclosure  i received this product for free or discounted price in exchange for my honest an unbiased review of the umbrella  the views in this review are my opinion and my thoughts might vary from yours  i try to give buyers a good idea of what there getting before they make a purchase  i know i rely upon other people s reviews when i m making purchases  i hope my thoughts of this product help with your decision 
what about canada 
i live up here in this place that is far from the hustle and bustle of human settlement  isolated and forlorn  the land stretches from view in an endless unbroken wilderness of forest and marshland  where wolves roam and food is scarce  when we venture forth to seek sustenance it is a hard trek and at the end of it is bound to be disappointment and failure  for it is a forbidding and unforgiving world and it is best left to the beavers who make it their home  the wind makes this its eternal home  but it is the rain that dispenses pure evil  for it is relentless in its character  and it pours without pity or regret  thus to find protection from this endless rain  which pours also at night   it is befallen to us to try first the general store  who more likely than not are bereft of stock or  if possessing of it  are wont to ask a frightfully dear remuneration  as they remind us  the effort of having obtained these items is extreme and these resources inabundant  thus it is behooven us to venture to the towns and villages  for which the hiring of ponies and driver is a tiresome and thankless task       mr  tremblay and his native assistant hew not to a civilized demeanour   je vay pah la bah   he shouts  for he is hard of hearing from excessive shots from his gun   say troh lwahn   i understand him not  no matter how loud his entreaties  yet in this land we call kanata  although others call it differently  the rumours flew of a magical place that was a mighty river named amazon  that flowed with bounty and richness  and also umbrellas  mr  tremblay was persuaded  with an envelope addressed to the postmaster of the river outpost named amazon  and a pouch of good kanatian silver   to carry forth my plea for an umbrella that could withstand the rain of kanata and perhaps aid in fending off raccoon dogs that come like thieves in the night to steal our corn crop  for it was rumoured that this umbrella could explode with a fearful clamour  much like a gun  and so it was  that in the month of may  at the peak of the rains  mr  tremblay and his assistant kemosabeh returned bearing a parcel upon which was marked  amazon com  the meaning of which i know not  and inside the package was wrapped the most magnificent of objects  a teflon exploding umbrella named repel  which  although small in stature  when expanded with much conundrum  becomes a wand of wondrous skill  rebuffing the most energetic assaults of rain and wind  and  perhaps  raccoons  after much fanfare  mr  tremblay  kemosabeh and i  holding the repel umbrella above us to stave off the heavens expulsions  ventured forth into the kanata bushlands in search of our own amazon  far from fear and hunger and raccoons  thus it was that we came unto amazon ca  with much reluctance  for in the short time we had possessed it  the umbrella had become rather dear  we handed it to the postmaster and commanded him to go forth and multiply this umbrella into many umbrellas  and then ship them thereupon  for amazon ca does not have the repel umbrella and i just want to know just what it is about canada that you folk don t like 
a great umbrella with solid hearty construction  a tad on the small side though exactly as advertised
disclaimer  i haven t been able to use the umbrella under very rainy conditions  i got to pull out the umbrella for the first time today in a light drizzle with some fair wind  the umbrella is definitely a bit smaller than my previous one  i hadn t taken measurements of it but it was probably more so the 60   ones  this one for me at 5 9  meant my shins and shoes would get slightly wet if there was any wind  not a big deal  but just letting people know  the construction feels extremely solid  the action is smooth  and especially when pushing the umbrella back in  you can feel the pole being a snug  well lubricated fit  i e  when you push down on the umbrella to fold it back up it slides very smoothly  my old umbrella s pole would noticeably wobble back and forth when folding it back up  so this was a welcome change  it definitely does very well in wind  i intentionally turned it to catch the wind and see how it did  and the legs all flexed but did not give  the wind was pretty gentle but gives me hope  its ability to do this without the flaps that let the wind pass is particularly impressive  definitely deflected rain itself pretty well  and seemed to have come home drier than i expected  probably meaning the rain slid off of it more easily than it did my old umbrella  seems to suggest at either a smoother surface that doesn t let water collect or a hydrophobic coating that lets water slide off more easily  in any case great there too 
best all around compact travel umbrella i could find
before i made this purchase  i checked a pretty decent number of reviews and comparisons  granted  i ve had umbrellas in the past  but i d never made an informed purchase when selecting one for myself  generally  i just grabbed whatever was on sale at my local retailer and happened to be an acceptable color  i had accepted as fact that compact travel umbrellas would always have tiny  flimsy canopy coverage that required me to huddle beneath them while my arms and anything i was carrying got soaked and that the first noteworthy gust of wind would render them useless  if not destroy them  after my last umbrella experienced a catastrophic failure from a relatively normal breeze  i decided that there has to be a better product and that i was going to find it  my requirements were that it had to be compact enough to fit into my glove compartment  feature auto open close  and open with a large enough canopy for me to walk comfortably and remain dry with something in my arms  my search led me to the repel easy touch  which had come out at or near the top of many comparison tests and had an endless list of stellar reviews  i can honestly say that the people were not wrong  i absolutely love this little umbrella  at 11 5  when compacted  it is amongst the smaller end of its class and easily fits in my glove compartment  however  it pops out to a generous 42  canopy that offers great coverage for all but the largest of individuals  not only does it do these things  but it has a look and feel that imparts obvious quality and attention to design  press that little button and the canopy deploys with very authoritative speed and power that is sure to impress the user  as well as any nearby witnesses  the main shaft appears to be thicker and more substantial than most  the 9 sturdy ribs hold the canopy quite taut and do incredibly well on windy days for a lightweight single canopy design  there are heavier and larger dual canopy umbrellas that are stronger  but they don t meet my needs here   and of course  it dries instantly when you re out of the rain  with the auto close working every bit as well as the auto open  the bottom line is that i love this umbrella and am extremely pleased that i decided to spend a little bit more to get a better value  the follow up email from the company after purchase and the fact that they back their product with a lifetime warranty further evidence the quality of the product and sweeten the purchase experience  so if you need or want a compact travel umbrella  i highly recommend this product  it is definitely worth the few extra dollars 
 it s just an umbrella  i thought to myself
after my old umbrella was destroyed by gust of wind  i was prompted to search for a new umbrella  i searched on amazon  and the first thing that appeared on the search result was repel easy touch umbrella  the price of roughly  25 was an instant turn off  the idea of paying more than  15 for an umbrella was absurd  however  the features of having  dupont teflon technology    9 reinforced fiberglass ribs   and  auto open close  made me reconsider  when my package had arrived  i needed to test this umbrella   what makes this so good   i wondered to myself  i pushed the button and poof  the umbrella sprang opened  my eyes opened wide   what is this magic   i said out loud  i pushed the button once more  and the umbrella closed as promised in the advertisement  i giggled and my eyes sparked  i had to share this magical contraption with my friends  on the following day  it was expected to rain  i ve never been so excited for rain in my entire life  i arranged to meet my friends for dinner  i had to bring this umbrella  and even did my rain dance to ensure it would rain that night  when i had arrived at the restaurant  i met my friends  including a girl who i have never met before  however  it wasn t raining  i was deeply saddened  yet i still carried the umbrella with me   ready for the moment  after filling out bellies  we proceeded to the exit  outside  it was raining   no    it was pouring cats and dogs  i had the biggest grin on my face  and i stood up straight and proudly push the button  the umbrella sprang to life  everyone looked up in amazement  i have never felt more admired than i ever had before  my friends looked at me  demanding to know where they could buy this umbrella  fortunately  the girl whom i had mentioned  looked at me with her large eyes  she wanted to learn more about this umbrella  and we exchanged contacts  thank you repel easy touch umbrella for getting me a phone number  oh and thanks for keeping me dry
seems very sturdy  teflon coating is great
we bought these for our summer trip to ireland england  since both tend to have weather changes throughout the day  we only used them for one day in ireland  it wasn t extreme weather  but it was a consistent heavy drizzle with occasional gusts  we did see others on our excursion with destroyed umbrellas  though i didn t think the wind was that strong   the wind did occasionally invert the outer portion of the canopy  but never did i think the umbrella would fail  the skeleton frame seemed very strong  directing the top of the umbrella back in the direction of the wind put it back into place easily  i was really impressed with the teflon coating  as the canopy did not get soaked through  the droplets stayed pooled on top of the fabric and i was able to easily shake them off  i also like the push button open close  easy to use and easy to put the cover back on the closed umbrella  highly recommend 
great little compact umbrella for every day commuting
old umbrella gave up the ghost and decided to purchase this brand based on amazon reviews  pros  lightweight  opens smoothly  auto fold up button  smooth textured grip  umbrella repels water admirably and seems to dry much quicker than standard umbrellas  good price on amazon  cons  none that i can report at this time  bottom line  if you are in need of a small  lightweight umbrella for daily commuting to and from work  i highly recommend this umbrella  it repels water and drys quickly  which is a great benefit when walking into the office on a soggy morning 
sturdily built for an umbrella in this price range 
i read about the repel easy touch umbrella on a website that tests consumer products  of the many umbrellas tested  this came out on top  after ordering and examining it  i can say with confidence that it is sturdily built with quality materials  it opens   closes with satisfying authority  the handle is dimpled   comfortable to hold  the fabric is treated with teflon  so it sheds rain  the canopy provides enough coverage  so you ll be well protected from the elements  i ve spent twice as much on a german designed umbrella  that was also well built    this umbrella is it s equal in nearly every respect  note  it has a little weight to it    the heavy duty spring might make it a challenge for the elderly to close  beyond that  what more could you want in an umbrella 
you should get it 
this is an excellent umbrella  i have only used it a few times because it hasn t rained much but i love it  i have to say that i don t like umbrellas in general  i hate carrying them  especially after they re wet   i absolutely hate it when they flip over so i just wear a raincoat  that said  i recommend this umbrella 100   i wish they had it in different colors  at least basic colors  and the size is pretty comfortable too making it fit well in my purse but smaller would be even better  it is very sturdy  and well made  you can tell that it was designed with care  i like the fabric  it truly is repellent  the few times i ve used it it would already be dry by the time i got to my office  the rain seems to just slide off  i like that it is curved enough to cover my face a little  the ribs are super reinforced  i included pictures for you to see for yourself  i m pretty sure i won t have any problems when it s windy  but i will update once i ve been in a storm with the umbrella  disclaimer  i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion  i give the items an honest review based on my own personal use and experience with them  no matter what i paid for them  i dont get anything in return for leaving a 5 star review  a lot of people think that those who get items at a discount just leave 5 stars and don t care  that is not my case  i believe these sellers are new businesses and need to get people to try their products  i rely heavily on other people s opinions when purchasing items online  so i do my best to help others like me  when i review items i follow the amazon recommendations for rating the items  one star   i hate it two stars   i don t like it three stars   it s okay four stars   i like it five stars   i love it
good compact umbrella
so this is a short term review  i haven t had this umbrella long enough to really beat it up and put it through its paces  however i got it for free in exchange for my promise to review it  so you kind of have to get that review out there if you want to hold up your end of the deal  if you want shoot me a message and ill update you on how it goes and if i get that ill shoot back here and update this whole thing  but generally you gotta remind me or im not gonna  unless of course it turns out really bad then i get pissed and dig this up  so here is my initial use impression  its a good compact umbrella  they spent a little time on the canopy part  i took a picture of the ribs inside and you can see a lot of moving parts as well as springs i am not used to seeing in an umbrella  i whipped this thing around to  blow it out  and you can tell that the outer sections of the ribs are flexible plastic so you can blow it out and pop it back  looks like you can do that several times without incident  however since this is the initial impression i will mention that i would prefer a more solid feel on the shaft of the umbrella  also a snappier spring  there is nothing wrong with it as it is  i think  but it didn t instill confidence when i opened it  the canopy did  but the collapsing shaft and spring action didn t strike me as the same philosophy as the time spent on the canopy  time will tell  edit i feel bad about my comment about the shaft feel  i have picked up a second umbrella today and when opening it i felt that it was a more solid feel upon opening  so i picked this umbrella back up and it feels the same as the second one  so ill retract that comment and say that the shaft felt perfectly acceptable to me upon further consideration 
small but strong   this is what i was looking for
where i live rain can come very unexpected and be gone in few minutes  i decided that i need small but good umbrella  which i can keep in my handbag  i was intrigued by the reviews this umbrella has and decided to try it  first i m very happy with the size of it  this umbrella fits perfectly in my handbag and don t weight too much  so i can have it with me all the time  it has comfortable case where i can keep it compact  it has button for folding unfolding so i don t need to apply pressure to close it after use  like in some cheap versions of this type of umbrellas   just press button and all done  the handle is slip proof and very comfortable  and it has a strap if you want to hang it  it looks small  but unfolded it s quite big and can cover you properly  i was impressed by the material umbrella is made of  it looks and feels very strong and it repeals water as stated in the description  as they say   like water from the goose    i wasn t able to try it in   storm   conditions yet  where you were my umbrella like a week ago  with all these thunderstorms happening   still think that this umbrella will outlast strong winds  its construction looks very sturdy and i tried to shake it quite hard  to imitate windy conditions  i had so many cheap umbrellas before  most of them were getting broken after first stronger rain  now i know this umbrella was what i really needed  strong  sturdy  high quality  and small in size  i received a 100  discount voucher from the seller  but it didn t affected my opinion about the product  i would definitely buy it for full price and recommend it to others 
 we have had a cool  wet
unfortunately i got to test my new umbrella just a day after receiving it   we have had a cool  wet  windy month which successfully destroyed my old umbrella   indulging in a bit of magical thinking  i was hoping that as soon as i bought a new one it would stop raining  no such luck  the good news is that the umbrella is great  it performed flawlessly in a stiff wind  it has two more ribs than the one i just replaced  it seems much more robust and much better made than others i have owned  after receiving it i received a very nice email from the manufacturer thanking me for my purchase  what a nice surprise  how nice it is to get a great product at a fair price from someone who cares about your business  if you need an umbrella  this is the one to buy 
it s a fine one  it extends with the easy push of    
okay guys  it s an umbrella  that s it so  let s not get carried away with ourselves here  however  as umbrellas go  it s a fine one  it extends with the easy push of a button and fully unveils itself with authority   thwack   fwoom      and just like  that  you re shielded from precipitation  size matters  there will be no 1950 s style  two person snuggling under the canopy as torrential rain falls about  as you gently fall in love  this thing is built to cover one person  but it does it quite well  the struts are sturdy  the seams firmly affixed  and the moisture quick to wick away  i carry two  one resides in the wall console of my jeep wrangler  and the other in my backpack because n  texas weather is bi polar as it gets feb  through april 
great umbrella
so some back story    i had a couple cheap umbrellas lying around the house  i had one from over 10 years ago  worked good enough  however a few months ago the wind was so strong it broke the shaft in half between the handle and the top part  was not happy  but had another cheap umbrella i bought in amsterdam for 5 euros  the wind over there broke the support beams on the side  but worked enough to get around  about a week ago it finally gave out completely so i did what any person does these days  look online for reviews  after a little bit of research  this umbrella was the winner  people say it will survive heavy winds and is portable enough to carry around in my backpack  also the piece of mind of a lifetime guarantee sold me on the product  got the umbrella a couple days ago and got a friendly message from the support team making sure i received the product as well as checking to make sure i am completely happy with the product  definitely nice to see a company care about their products  woke up this morning to rain outside  it wasn t windy  but raining enough to give this umbrella a test drive  i walked outside for around 20 minutes this morning in the rain and here s what i noticed  completely dry after walking around with a slight breeze  i didn t notice any issues when going inside i did a quick spin of the umbrella and the canopy appears mostly dry except for a little condensation of portion that is folded over  which surprised me how much the material repels the water overall so far i am impressed     
stop here   you have found your next umbrella  
these are really cool  awesome customer service  i got a pink one for my mom  and a black one for myself   they pop open  and with the same push of the button the retract and close   pretty cool  kinda stiff to collapse after that  but not in a bad way  once you use it you will understand what i mean   all in all its a great product  would buy again 100 
the perfect travel umbrella
i just received this umbrella in time for a spring  rainy    trip to london  i am quite impressed with the construction  it feels much sturdier than my victorinox  the victorinox has only six ribs and leaked like a sieve   the repel umbrella opens and closes very smoothly  and when it opens you have the feeling that the springs are stout  nothing wimpy about this umbrella  the size is perfect for travel and the weight reasonable for a quality product  coming with a lifetime warranty is a real plus  i will post an update if this does not perform to my expectations     but i have every reason to believe it will be perfect 
hurricane mathew defeated
i have been waiting to write about this umbrella i ll admit that i did not think it was worth the money and that it would not live up for the hype  however it rained alot during mathew and we had extreme winds everything  i watched other people s umbrella blow away and i held on to my umbrella tight  the insane thing about this umbrella is the fact that it dries so fast it s like swim trunks  my only grip is the fact that it s kind of small  it s really not the lets cuddle underneath this umbrella as i romantically carry us to the car  it s more like if we squeeze we can make it and sustain a minimal amount of water  however this is pretty much a tank 
seems like it s a well made umbrella
i just received my umbrella  looks to be well made  i have not had a chance to use it yet as weather has been great  only time will tell how well it functions and stands up to the elements  for now  i will have to defer to those who have reviewed it and owned it for several months and have had good experience with it  the company that makes it has been quite communicative having sent me two emails reminding me of the lifetime warranty  nice to see them being proactive   other companies manufacturers could learn something from them  reach out and touch your customers  seems like they stand behind their product 
an incredible ubmbrella
i absolutely love this umbrella  it s strong  easy to use  compact  and looks nice  edit  after a while the umbrella got stuck and i have to push on it in a way i m not supposed to to get it to do what it s supposed to do  2nd edit  the seller of this product sent me an email letting me know she would give me a refund for the product  i took her up on the offer and i want to say that i think my problem was probably just a fluke judging from how nice everything else about the umbrella is  i wouldn t hesitate buying from this seller despite me having this problem 
good quality and strong
what a blessing this baby has been  it s been raining in louisiana non stop  we are actually flooding here right now  i couldn t have gotten this at a better time  the quality of this umbrella is really nice  it is really compact and small  so it fits easily into my purse or my work bag  even though it is compact when closed  it opens up to a really good size  it comes with a cover to put it in  this allows less dripping from the umbrella itself  which can get all over our cars and cause it to smell  however  with that being said  this umbrella is made from a certain type of teflon  that repels the waters and allows for pretty close to immediate drying  it s basically a rain x umbrella  so to speak  i used it yesterday and it really did dry up that quick  the umbrella actually has a 9 rib construction  unlike the normal 6 or 8 ribs  this means that it is able to withstand higher wind gusts without flipping inside out  it has an easy open and close function  you just press the button on the handle and voila  there is a wrist strap for easy carrying when you are not using it  i tried to take a picture of it yesterday  but it was really humid and gross outside from the rain  so my picture is a little foggy  overall  this is a really nice quality and solidly built umbrella  i see this lasting a really long time and hey  if it doesn t i read in the instructions that there is a lifetime replacement guarantee  cannot beat that    update   i took a picture of it after coming in from a huge rain storm  look how there is barely any water on it  it definitely repels the water like i ve never seen  i also want to add that i have never used an umbrella that opened up so easily  i m definitely glad to have this  
great product 
after doing a fair amount of research on travel umbrellas  i settled on the repel windproof travel umbrella  it arrived per my expectations and was appropriately packed  the unit appears to be of reasonable quality  although i haven t used it very much yet to see how it does over the long haul  provided i don t lose it    best features  1  the fiberglass ribs   i expect these to hold up better than the typical lightweight and highly bendable ribs that are found in drugstore umbrellas  2  the up down button   i normally expect an umbrella to have button or switch that opens it  the  down  part of the button was pleasant surprise  it makes retraction of the canopy so much faster and easier  getting into a car after walking across a rainy parking lot is much easier  however   be forewarned   if you hit the down button while the umbrella is overhead  you get the shower you were trying to avoid  i ve only had it out in the rain once so far  there wasn t much wind  so i can t comment on that aspect of this umbrella  it did provide expected coverage for the size of its canopy  and as mentioned above  it is easy to open and collapse  great product 
great umbrella   and the price is great also 
this is the only umbrella i need  i purchased this umbrella a little skeptical of the claims but they came through with flying colors  the umbrella opens easily and i have had no issues at all  the fabric is very nice and attached very well to the spines  i have had no issues with blow out from this umbrella even with some of the heavy winds i have experienced in thunderstorms  it is very compact and fits in my small back pack so i have it where ever i go  the included cover is also nice just in case i cannot open it to dry it out and have to wait to get home so this allows me to just pop it in the cover and then open it when i get home to dry it if needed  the next best thing is the price  you cannot go wrong with this umbrella if you are looking for a compact size as well as great performance in the wind and rain 
the little umbrella that could
the little umbrella held up in the gusty wind on the second floor at the eiffel tower  it was raining cats and dogs when we were up there  and the teflon kept us dry while we were taking photos  the automatic open and close buttons are convenient as well  we are very pleased with our purchase 
when it was in a good condition  however
it got the job done  when it was in a good condition  however  after only use this umbrella for few times  the head piece breaks  for the price  i m not expecting this kind of quality update  they manged to sent me a new one
this is a very durable umbrella  i took it    
this is a very durable umbrella  i took it out for the first time for a few days in a rainstorm with heavy winds  it withstood the elements very well  a strong gust of wind did not cause the umbrella to invert and caused no visible damage whatsoever  plus  the lifetime warranty can t be beat  i will probably order several of these later this year as christmas gifts to my friends and family 
this umbrella is the best
it hadn t rained for many months in california  come to think of it  i had not experienced rain bad enough for years  people would think you were crazy if you had an umbrella out in los angeles  now  out here in the midwest  it rains a lot  one minute it will be sunny  but then you see these dark clouds slowly moving in  the sun is blocked  and suddenly it s raining like a faucet  from my apartment i can see the poor souls running to escape the downpour  others just walk and deal with it  this is a great umbrella  not only is it effective in keeping me dry  it helped me keep another girl caught in the rain dry  also  along with her number  it didn t work out  unfortunately  this umbrella is an excellent choice  i was choosing between this with the dupont coating and another with a purported self closing mechanism  and opted to buy this for the water repellent coating  it comes with a pouch that can be useful for storage  but i wouldn t put a damp umbrella inside  the handle is comfortable  it has a gentle  soft rubbery texture  similar to gaming or computer mice  so it provides some extra gripping power when it s windy out there  pushing the button will open it with some force  but then you do have to push upward to lock the umbrella open  closing is similar in that you have to push down on the umbrella and handle to have it click close  and i would agree that the dupont coating does make a big difference  you will be able to shake a significant portion of the water off  and indoors when you leave it open  it will dry quickly 
lightweight  small and perfect for a daily commuter
so it s july in tennessee  the weather app on my phone says  no rain  so i walk out of the house with no raincoat or umbrella  i commute by train and foot   about a mile each way  of course  at 4 o clock when it s about time to leave the sky will open up  the last time this happened i had my old umbrella at my desk and headed off home  about 1 3 of the walk through my walk it started to rain  pulled the  old  umbrella out of the bag and opened it  first gust of wind turned it inside out  i was soaked  my mission was to find a reliable umbrella  enter the travel umbrella from upper echelon  at a price i thought was fair but not cheap  i ordered it directly and received it quickly  on first use  it is sturdy and didn t flip inside out at the first gust of wind  it has an automatic open and close  i really like the auto close   it came with a nylon carry bag  great for keeping the interior of my tote bag dry  it s large enough for 2 people but not too big for one  it s lightweight  with a small collapsed size  black is the only color available  it repels the water really well  i still have my old umbrella sitting under my desk  just in case  but the new umbrella is so small and light that it stays permanently in my commuter tote so i ll have it for the pop up showers i ve come to expect 
great umbrella and even greater customer service   
i am a permanent carpool passenger and as such have to wait outside in all weather  i read the rave reviews of this umbrella and bought one  i took it to the beach on my vacation and couldn t wait to try it out  although  admittedly rain while on vacation is a downer   it was immediately clear to me upon opening it that it was much sturdier than my many other pretty but impractical umbrellas  there are few things that annoy me more than an umbrella that flips inside out in high wind  sadly  my new repel umbrella must have rolled under my car while i was loading the car to return from vacation  bottom line   i didn t have it when i got home  i immediately went online and bought another one  the company reached out to me and i told them i liked the umbrella very much but had lost it  i received a followup email and they are sending me another one  this is a great company that will replace an umbrella that i was careless and lost  i only hope that someone finds the original umbrella in that parking garage and gives it a good home  they will be pleasantly surprised by the quality  not to mention it had been used exactly once so it s brand new  
outstanding umbrella
i have used this umbrella several times since buying it a couple weeks ago  once in a high wind  i like it so much i am placing an order for a second one  it fits nicely in the side pocket of my auto without having to try to slip it back into the sleeve provided  i have yet to find a travel umbrella that will actually fit easily into its sleeve  with this one it is compact enough to fit without the sleeve  it would be nice if someone could come up with a sleeve that actually fits a travel umbrella without a great deal of hassle  i find it to be of high quality and a good size once opened  it provides plenty of coverage  this is a travel umbrella  after all  it is not a golf umbrella  you are not going to fit 2 or 3 people under it  i have owned many travel umbrellas over the years and this is as large as any i have found on the market  larger than most  this earns a five star rating for me 
a sturdy umbrella at a good price  read the instructions 
i have not had it long  but this appears to be a very well built and sturdy umbrella  for a relatively compact umbrella  it has a nice wide canopy  i ve tried it in rain already  and it works fine  the umbrella comes with opening and closing instructions   take a quick look at them before using the product  most important  the umbrella opens with some authority and force  and you don t want to have it pointed at anyone  when closing  press down on the top of the umbrella rather than gripping the ribs  to prevent damage  the umbrella folds down to 11 5 inches  and so i wouldn t call it tiny  nor it that light  thanks to its build quality  still  it does qualify as compact  and i think it would fit easily in most larger purses and of course backpacks 
great umbrella  glad i purchased it 
excellent umbrella  i had a totes umbrella for 10 years and i decided to get a new one since the metal ribs on the totes umbrella had started rusting  i saw an article on the reviewed website that listed this as the best travel umbrella  so i decided to give this one a shot  and i m sure happy i did  the first thing you notice is the material on the umbrella  it appears to be of a much higher quality than my previous umbrella  then the handle  which for me is just right sized and comfortable to hold  the opening mechanism works very well and the umbrella pops open  the ribs are thicker and appear to be better constructed than my previous umbrella  during the storm  the umbrella performed well  even in the wind  the closing mechanism worked much better than my previous umbrella  it was impressive in how fast it dried out  took me a minute to get it folded back up right so i could put the cover back on  but i was able to accomplish it  all in all  i d recommend this umbrella
supercalifragilistically designed for your protection 
marty poppins  mary s cousin  would be proud to own this heavy duty  rain repellent  truly automatic umbrella  it s sturdy design makes it virtually windproof as well  for those long trips above the skyline while traveling to the next nanny assignment  you ll feel secure holding it above your head and when you land the children will be wide eyed and supercalifragilistically impressed as you push a button and it collapses into a neat bundle  ready to be secured with its handy velcro wrap and pushed back into its handle until the job is finished and you call upon its protection again 
worth every penny
this product is a   in college  i can t count how many times i had wind just absolutely destroy my umbrellas  when i graduated and started working  i didn t want my business clothes to get wrecked in the rain if i got caught in a storm  i have had this umbrella for almost two months and it has stood up to its claims  i actually feel a smug satisfaction when i see other people s umbrellas invert and i am just straight chilling  not getting rained on  i also like that the button both opens and closes the umbrella  it is nice to have a quick click when walking in and out of buildings or cars  i am actually getting some more as christmas presents  because everyone could use
i am very happy with the repel umbrella
i waited to write this review until i really tested it  and i did  we had some strong wind and heavy rain the past two days and this umbrella held strong  it did not even flip once  unlike my previous three umbrellas  which i had to throw out after a strong wind and rain day   i am very happy with the repel umbrella 
so far  so good  and dry 
i had my first opportunity to use the umbrella today  it worked well  and held up to a stiff wind  too  however  it s probably silly to rate an umbrella after one day s use  they all work on the first day  i suppose the extra  9th  rib helps it stand up to wind  but it also provides an additional point of potential failure as the umbrella ages  i m used to buying umbrellas at the nearest drug store  they last a few years  then fail  either by leaking or more likely by a broken rib or broken shaft detent  i like umbrellas that collapse into a small package i can fit inside my briefcase  this is the first umbrella i bought on amazon  as i say  so far  so good  however  i may update this review someday if the umbrella fails earlier than it should have 
 this is the only umbrella you should ever purchase   it is a  must have  
first of all  i have no financial interest in this company nor have i received any incentive to write this review  this umbrella is  the best of the best   for the following reasons  1  the frame is strong  2  the handle is strong  3  the open close mechanism is easy to operate  reaction is swift  when opening and closing  4  the fabric is thick and repels water instantly  also  the fabric is attached to the frame with strong thread and the stitching is secure  5  the size is perfect to stow in a purse  briefcase  backpack  etc  6  excellent quality and affordable price  7  the stowage sleeve is convenient and made of the same excellent teflon fabric 
like a gel
i did not receive a discount for my opinion  this review is based on my initial impressions after receiving the product and nothing more  packaging  inside the shipping box  the umbrella did not come in a box of it s own  it was in a plastic sheathe that was slightly too short to encase the handle  the handle was protected by bubble wrap with a rubber band to hold it securely in place  build  it was exactly as pictured  i expected the handle to be softer  like a gel  but it is a hard plastic with a rubber like surface for improved grip  the build looks sturdy  though i am a little concerned that bottom rod and top rods have a little bit of rotational wiggle  also  there were some spare loose threads on the end of one of the spokes where it had been tied off  i expected to be able to feel some type of coating  but the fabric feels really thin  and i couldn t see or feel any difference  functionality  beware  when you first receive it the button may have been pressed already  i unwrapped the strap  and the umbrella sprang out immediately  be sure you don t have it aimed at anyone  yourself included  i pressed the button  and it sprang closed  it did take some strength to push it back in  it may be difficult for children and some adults  the average person won t have a problem with it  i closed it and opened it 4 or 5 times  it performed consistently and flawlessly  final thoughts  it seems to be sturdy  and it opens and closes as it should  for  50 00 i d like to have seen a gel handle on it  but it was on sale for  20 95  and didn t advertise a gel handle  so i can t take any points away for not being as advertised  we don t get much wind here in missouri  but the price was right for having a lifetime warranty  i will update this rating after i ve tried it in the rain  and or if the open close mechanism fails 
seems well built and well designed 
i bought two of these for my and my spouse s upcoming trip to the uk  where we ll most likely need something reliable and sturdy  it s heavier  at close to a pound  than most cheaper compact umbrellas  but if that means it s built better  and it looks solid  it s worth it  pressing the open close button causes it to spring open like a batman utensil  so you d better be clear of obstructions and or fragile humans  pressing the button again causes the canopy to rapidly collapse  although it doesn t retract down the shaft back to the handle  you have to push down from the top center of the canopy  where there is a hard disk for that purpose  until it clicks into place  the pleats retain their shape so that you can easily re store the umbrella back into the carrying sleeve looking like it did when first opened  i won t know how it will hold up until we start our vacation  but will post an update if there are any problems 
    have to say this one is by far my favorite  it keeps me dry and has never inverted    
i ve owned at least 50 umbrellas  some bought off the street from a vendor or designer ones  in my lifetime and have to say this one is by far my favorite  it keeps me dry and has never inverted due to the wind  pet peeve   want to know something else about this umbrella  the company that sells it is amazing with its customer service and lifetime warranty policy  the button started to not work as well  sometimes have to press it 2 3 times before it reacts  so i reached out to the company  not only did they respond in record lightening speed time  the company sent out a replacement  this all happened in 12 hours   highly recommend this umbrella  i rarely give out 5 stars for anything but have to say between the quality of the umbrella and the customer service lifetime guarantee  you can t go wrong 
classy cute umbrella
i have benkii before less1 year  but i lost it    this is the replacement i chose since it has lifetime warranty without needing to send the umbrella itself back  no need to ship the item if broken  and i expect no less on that promise    pros   feels more durable than other small umbrella  you can notice it by the weight itself and the sturdiness of the main steel  teflon coated so it will dry very fast on rain  ribs feels like bendable durable material so it will survive sudden winds  very handy  fits on small bag  very classy look  lifetime warranty without needing to ship the item back    if it broke within a year i might try this  with screen shot and video record  cons   i thought the fabric would be a lot thicker since its teflon coated  not an issue though     the spring when opening is not super strong but its my preference only  i like it to be more stronger faster open note  the cons is base on my preference because i have benkii before and as of now my bag is small so i chose the top umbrella which i think this is  d kudos to the repel team 
well made product  excellent vendor
change from 2 to 5 stars  after a not so great impression  i sent a message to the seller who promptly asked if i wanted a refund or replacement  needing an umbrella i asked for a replacement  it arrived quickly and at no cost  one of my original issues was that the button to open requires far too much effort  so does closing it  this is still true  but i ve come to realize the product  including this part  is well made  my first time using it was during a rainstorm with 50 mph gusts  i walked 3 blocks from my work to a parking garage  the umbrella inverted twice  after that it did not open automatically  popped up but required manual pushing to lock in place  i am grateful for the free replacement 
this one goes to 9   
nicely built  the metal shaft is black however  not chrome  ribs have composite plastic components as well as metal  easy to hold grip  powerful spring to fully open and partially close  a little smaller profile in  diameter  and height than i expected when i first opened it  but it makes it easy to negotiate into and out of a vehicle with the smaller canopy during a downpour  disclaimer  downpour in southern california   overall  this is a quality built  lightweight umbrella  comes with easy on   easy off cover  my last umbrella was nearly 30 years old  and i m guessing i paid  10 or  12 for it  so the repel at  24 seems like a good value  i always open mine indoors and let it dry before stowing  so we ll see how it lasts 
excellent umbrella  would definitely recommend
i like bullet points  thus    excellent build construction   does not feel flimsy or cheap  has held up well against strong winds downpours    the small form factor is convenient and makes it easy to carry around    the quick open close function helps keep you dry  especially when attempting to enter a vehicle     lifetime guarantee is reassuring  that having been said  i can t speak upon their customer service because my umbrella hasn t had any issues    mildly more expensive i believe this umbrella represents a great value  great construction and i really like the quick open close feature  it s a touch more expensive  but the build quality and lifetime guarantee easily justify it for me  my only complaint is that i wish it was bigger  i had gotten a bigger version  which would kind of defeat its compact form factor   this umbrella works very well for an individual  but it is a bit difficult to keep two people dry if it is raining very hard  all in all  an amazing umbrella that i would definitely recommend 
stands up to tough weather
i live in chicago suburbia so i have very little tolerance for subpar coats  boots  umbrellas  etc  we really need our weather related items to work as hard as we do  i am very pleased with this umbrella because not only does it shield me from precipitation  but it is also made to withstand strong winds  certainly  every product has its limit  and i m sure if you simulated a strong enough wind gust perhaps you could make this umbrella turn inside out  however it would take a storm that is newsworthy even in these parts  as in you may hear the tornado sirens  99  of the time this umbrella will be more than sufficient and it is competitively priced  so i m very satisfied  i especially appreciate the frame  the  bones  of the umbrella are not like a typical umbrella  and i believe the product description mentions that they are made differently 
great product and customer service
the umbrella feels sturdy  haven t experienced any significant wind gust to test the tolerance of the umbrella  the only negative about the umbrella is the rust that is starting to develop around the aluminum rib cages  2 11 17   tested the umbrella under strong wind conditions and the umbrella held up extremely well  the umbrella did flip over once  however  no damage to the aluminum frame  purchased another umbrella today as a gift  1 6 17 edit   upgraded item from 3 stars to 5 stars  rebecca from customer service reached out to me in regards to the defective product after the warranty had expired  2 options  replacement or refund  this is my go to umbrella so a replacement was the only alternative  as an added bonus  i get to keep my original umbrella thank you upper echelon products 
well made umbrella
i ordered this during a rainstorm and since it arrived  i haven t had a chance to use it outside yet  so this is a review based on my initial impressions  i d been alternating between 2 very old umbrellas that have been in horrible shape for years  when i saw this on sale and read the reviews  i decided to treat myself to one  so far i m impressed  it feels very durable  it is beautifully and thoughtfully designed  for example  the handle has a nice texture that makes it easy to grip  and the handle is not round  it s oval  so it fits very comfortably in my hand  i prefer it s fabric wrist strap to the plastic straps on my old umbrellas  time will tell how well it holds up with use during winter and spring rains  which i hope are forthcoming  it s a little heavier than each of my old umbrellas  and i consider that a good sign  i m happy with my purchase so far 
most good quality umbrellas can t stand up to winds 20 mph
i work in new haven ct  and in the fall  and winter the wind comes right off the water  so i m always in the market for an umbrella that will last for a couple of years  i learned from experience  that there is no such thing as an umbrella that can stand up to 50 mph  most good quality umbrellas can t stand up to winds 20 mph  what i m looking for is a strong auto open close  and can stand up to heavy rains  this umbrella is very good quality  with a strong open close button  i will update when needed  as of now i m very happy with my purchase 
good value 
this umbrella is of better apparent quality than any other similar umbrella i have owned before  i have not owned it long enough to discover how durable it is  examination of the mechanism that opens it reveals that it is way more intricate than others i have owned  interestingly  there is no catch to keep it open once it is deployed  but the springs have sufficient tension to keep it open  if i encounter a windy day strong enough to collapse it  then i will not be happy  as repel states that i now have a  lifetime  warranty  i am not concerned about quality  assuming  of course  repel is even still in business once this thing wears out  since i live where rain is not very common  it will take years for me to wear it out  for now  i am happy 
broke upon second use  replaced immediately  great customer service
the second time i used this umbrella it opened with such force that it shot out of my hand and broke  after initial review i was contacted by the manufacturer via email  and was informed that they were happy to replace my product immediately 
great folding umbrella  easy to use  stands up to texas thunderstorms 
i received this repel windproof travel umbrella at the perfect time with several days of summer thunderstorms for testing  the easy open and close is a great feature and rain water shakes off very easily  the easy close is maybe my favorite feature  this is usually when i get soaked closing the umbrella while closing the car door but with the repel windproof travel umbrella i can have the door cracked just a bit and use the auto close feature and recover the umbrella leaving my dry  even with gusty winds the umbrella stayed firmly open with no blow back when several other around me had failures with their umbrella s of several types 
so far  so great 
one week after delivery  it began raining    and this has proved itself to be a good purchase  the auto open close is quick and easy  the waterproofed fabric leaves very little to shake off  the size is typical for small umbrellas  so you re dealing with the pro con of carrying a nice  small collapsible vs  a huge  long  with extra wide coverage  umbrella  all in all  i m quite happy  the closing function collapses the open umbrella  you still need to push the stem together to lock it closed   reload for auto opening  the spring is quite stiff    making opening very quick  but also requiring a bit of effort to close   reset  no complaints     but the stiff spring makes me wonder about the longevity  how long will it last  for the great price  though  if it lasts a year it s been a good purchase 
i finally got a chance to use this umbrella and    
i finally got a chance to use this umbrella and it broke the first time i used it  the canvas got detached from the one of the metal stickers the time i opened it  very disappointing  also  unfortunately  i didn t get a chance to try it out the first month i bought it  i ve no idea how to deal with this now  update  the customer service is really really good  within 24 hours after my previous review  their customer support specialist got back to me ordered a free replacement of the umbrella and now i got a new one and this one works pretty good so far  nothing is better than a responsive and caring customer service  5 star 
 update  great customer service 
 update 3 12 2017  upper echelon reached out to me and offered a refund for the purchase of the umbrella  great customer service  clearly this company cares about customer satisfaction  i will not hesitate to consider upper echelon for any future products i am in the market for that can be supplied by them                                                                                                                                                                                               the umbrella is very hard to close  takes a certain angle and more than expected amount of force to close the umbrella and lock it into place  the umbrella is also much smaller than i would have liked  with that said  it does well in poor weather 
i love this little umbrella
i love this little umbrella  if you only purchase one umbrella  it should be this one  folds up small  is compact enough to fit in a purse or car door  functions smoothly and has a decent sized dome  it s not as huge as the last one i had  but the last one i had didn t fold up small so i left it in the car half of the time    it does me no good there  i have had no issues with rust or water damage and have been using it in florida where it rains nearly every day in the summer months  great purchase  i will be buying another in the future as a spare or gift it to someone 
very good umbrella and repels water like crazy 
this umbrella is awesome  albeit a tad bit too small for me  i m around 6 2   so i need a little more coverage   the repel feature is great  and only takes a couple of shakes to get most of the water off of it  it doesn t soak in water either  so when it s time to put it up  i give it a couple of shakes and i m good to go  it s very compact  and fits in the side of my backpack  a swiss gear  easily with room to spare  i ve had it for about 4 months  and have taken it with me on a trip to hong kong  and it has held up very well  i would definitely get another one if i need it 
get one of these   you won t regret it 
where was this excellent umbrella last time that i was in nyc and saw over 100 broken discarded umbrellas stuffed into trash cans  this little fellow would have beat the wind and would have survived  i used it yesterday for the first time in denver and it opened like magic  handled the weather nicely  and i ll be darned if it didn t close per the advertisement  wow  get one   it s super 
sleek and powerful little umbrella
didn t think this little umbrella was going to be such amazing gadget  i like the color  all black  like that it s versatile  most of all  i like it s craftsmanship  it s very well made  the ribs and the tube feel like solid material  the most surprising of all is its spring loaded opening with the touch of a button  it s pretty dope fam  also halfway closes it with the same button  overall really cool  i keep it in my car  still haven t got to use it  but had to get one cause i accidentally left my old one at my friend s house who lives real far from me 
worst time of the year is during the monsoon season    
we live in this part of the world where we often experience afternoon violent thunderstorms  worst time of the year is during the monsoon season which usually falls at this time of the year  finally  we are able to put to test out our new repel umbrellas under actual strong wind conditions and thunderstorm rains  we must say repel umbrellas passed the extreme wind and water tests with flying colours and to our amazement  so far this is the best umbrella we have bought as compared to average or poorly made umbrellas available in our local market  it s worth the money to pay more for a better quality repel umbrellas that we have to order all the way from usa  certainly the quality of repel umbrellas and what it has said out to perform has exceeded our expectations and we won t hesitate to recommend them to our friends in malaysia 
buy it   it s worth it   
aren t you tired of all those  10 or freebie umbrellas failing you   they always do  yes  this one costs more than you wanted to pay  but it s worth the price  it s well constructed  does what it s supposed to  and doesn t appear to be ready to fail the next time i use it  plus  the auto open button also functions as an auto close button   remarkably convenient   and fun  so  add to cart  now 
held up well in storm
honestly i was pretty convinced this would be  yet another cheap chinese made knock off  thing  i stand corrected  this one survived a major rain storm on a hilltop in iceland  it did turn inside out about 5 times  but it did not break and simply help up better than my fellow photographer s ones  so far so good  no long term use  so can t speak to that aspect  very happy so far
