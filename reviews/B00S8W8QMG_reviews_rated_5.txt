it has bonus features 
works beautifully  i was a bit mystified when i heard sound coming from it  apparently this monitor has speakers built in  so that s a fun bonus i didn t know i had  they re a bit tinny but that s to be expected given their size and location  on the back of the monitor   for reference i use an hdmi cable with mine  i cannot speak to the way it might work with a vga cable  i don t believe it came with the hdmi cable so do be aware of that  also be aware that it will be the default speaker for your computer unless you go into your sound settings and turn that off  do this before you embarrass yourself like i did lol  the power light is blue led and blinks when the computer is off but the monitor is still on  which bothers me  i hate blinking lights  so i turn it off at night  whereupon the light just glows a nice friendly red  the stand is sturdy and easy to snap together  though i am always gentle with my electronics because well  why wouldn t you be 
it s a steal
at  70 it s impossible to find a better hdmi monitor  there were zero dead pixels on the one that i got and the image is incredible  a couple side notes  1  it can have up to 7 dead pixels without qualifying for a replacement under the manufacturer warranty  if this is a big deal to you then maybe consider spending more than  70 for a monitor  2  the stem that mounts into the base is not easily removable  if you are going to wall mount this unit  plan on prying open the shell to remove that stem 
fantastic monitor   no regrets 
received my new monitor today and have been using it for several hours now and i can t rave enough about it  i hooked it up via hdmi port and it setup on my nvidia gtx 750ti graphics card without a hitch no resizing of the desktop was needed as it would be if you had it hooked up to a tv  the picture is clear and colors are bright just as you would expect from hdmi  all factory presets of the monitor is perfect for me  i am a gamer and it has no lag in the rapidly changing pictures that occur during a long gaming session but at 5ms i wouldn t expect it to  power pack is self contained inside the unit itself so there s no extra pack taking up space on your desk a real plus to me since i hate desktop clutter  and the sound is pretty decent for being built in speakers on a monitor  which really don t bother me because if i play farm sim 2017 it is loud enough for me to hear the games sounds  and if i am playing something like fallout 4 i prefer a headset anyway since those game sounds bother my wife  and i prefer the ability to hear things coming at me from all angles up close and personal as compared to even the best desktop speakers  i have no regrets buying this monitor and at a sub  100 price tag and it being a 20  widescreen it can t be beat 
exceptional value  the picture quality is outstanding
exceptional value  the picture quality is outstanding  i bought the monitor for a little used computer  it s such a high quality 20  display  i instead have it on my main home computer  the controls are easy to see and access  it works flawlessly  this screen is worth for more than it s sold for  you will be glad you bought it  i am 
and sound from speakers is good enough  very happy with this purchase and the    
this monitor is being used for digital signage at trade shows  i opened it up turned it on  hooked the tablet up and voila  i am looping video  no dead pixels  and sound from speakers is good enough  very happy with this purchase and the price was the best part  if i ever need another  i will get another one fo these 
good for gaming
i bought this monitor in order to play it with my xbox one  it s a good monitor  it wasn t what i expected honestly  you know  you get what you paid for   i feel like i got more than what i paid for since i m able to play dark souls 3 with good graphics  it s a cheap monitor but it s worth if if you re just using it to play games at your desk  just incase you guys don t know  it has 1 hdmi input port 1 vga input port 1 dvi input port i recommend this tv for anyone with a low budget looking for a good monitor 
not big but includes everything you need
this isn t a large monitor  however the package includes everything you need  including a magnetic tipped small phillips head screwdriver with a rubber handle  the monitor  does  have speakers that work with hdmi connections  which given the  65 price of the monitor was a pleasant surprise  the buttons are on the back  and the back surface is not 100  flat  there is a bump out at bottom for the logic controllers and connectors  the oem stand does tilt up   down  but it sits pretty low  you will need phone books  shelf  etc  if you want it to be up higher  there is an audio out and in on the monitor s back for 3 5mm audio connections  it s as another reviewer said   by 2018 standards it s smallish  but for the cost they give you a lot 
great value for what you get 
i currently use this for my monitor on my home security system  picture is super clear  i love the fact that this has all the different inputs that you can use  this is placed in my office and there isn t a lot of space so the built in speakers aspect works perfect for me  they are clear and work really well  i will definitely purchase this again especially for this price 
sceptre 20  monitor
this is an excellent small monitor that i use for tuning up a directv portable satellite system for camping 
a good purchase
the screen went out on my laptop on which i view my wifi security cams  i hated to purchase another laptop since the computer portion still worked so i ordered the sceptre e series monitor  it arrived the next day and i hooked it up  it s been working great ever since  it s a larger screen than my non working 15 9 inch laptop screen and the colors are vibrant with a sharp picture  a good purchase
better than i expected 
perfect monitor for the price  very bright and colors are vivid on auto settings  you can play with adjustments  if you want  but it s fine on factory settings  the only  problem  is that the built in speakers are weak  which is to be expected  the monitor is thin and it doesn t take a lot of room on your desk  actually this monitor is better than i expected 
colors are great  connects easily to my laptop
for the price this can t be beat  i wanted a cheap 2nd monitor so i could work a second screen off my work laptop  but didnt want to spend alot because i work was not reimbursing me  this has worked seamlessly  colors are great  connects easily to my laptop  really no issues whatsoever  very pleased overall 
exceeded expectations
exceeded expectations for the price  i was about to order hdmi cable  but when i opened the box i see that box has monitor and hdmi cable and vga cable  5 stars for monitor quality and additional items
amazing monitors with good picture quality
amazing monitors with good picture quality  comes with generous hdmi cable  speakers are low quality but that is expected  nevertheless they also work perfectly and were plug and play  would buy again 
love sceptre
bought 3 of these and three 24  and already had another for about 10 years and it perfect  great bang fir the buck  these work great for my kids monitors  look amazing with beautiful colors and functions  speakers are better than expected as well 
excellent value for an acceptable price 
excellent monitor  the image is crisp  it is large enough for me and the built in speakers allowed me to get rid of my old speakers  thereby decreasing the cable jungle under my desk  i am very happy with the monitor 
so far so good only been up a week but no problems as    
so far so good only been up a week but no problems as of yet  i use it for my security camera s and video s are crystal clear  color and hue are pretty much right on with no adjustments right out of the box  for the price there can be no complaints  one of the best features are the three different video connections  just wish i hadn t gone cheap on the cameras so i would have sound to see what the speakers sound like on the monitor  also it did come with the hdmi cable that one reviewer claimed it didn t 
no cons   
great monitor  easy setup  good high def  more features than most would use  i have been buying sceptre for 15 years and never been disappointed  best value for the money i have found  my last scepture monitor lasted ten years 
fantastic  especially for the reasonable price 
absolutely beautiful display  connected as secondary monitor on mac and for hsmi display with a kodi box  wish it was 4  higher  but over all perfect 
bright clear display  sturdy stand  great price 
for the price this monitor is great  i use it for my home office as a secondary monitor to my laptop screen and my only regret is not getting a size larger  the stand is sturdy  the image is bight and sharp  and it s not ugly 
good deal for the price 
i bought these monitor for mi old computer  with vga port  and it works fine  set up was easy  it comes with two cables  vga to vga  and dvi to hdmi   perfect for small to medium desk  and has a very sharp definition for the price

nice screen and great price
nice screen and great price  had no issues with the screen and we bought two of them and both work great and do as they should 
i love it 
mine came in a few weeks ago and i love it so much  the colours are bright  and you can mess with your colour settings with the menu button  tf2  dota 2  cs go  eve  ect   they all look very crisp  even my sister s digital art looks 10x better on it  the led lighting does make it a little hard to stare at for extended periods of time though  still an absolutely wonderful monitor and it s pretty cheap compared to other brands  i would definitely recommend this monitor to those who re on a budget or are after a really nice cheap gaming art monitor 
best value for the money 
extremely nice picture and value for you money  the monitor comes with power cord and vga cable  however  the monitor has vga  hdmi and dvi inputs  it is vesa 100 compatible  however the swivel base stem is not removable  still a great value

great product
great monitor and easy to set up  only complaint would be that it was shipped in the package box so anyone walking by could tell what it was  not good for packages delivered to homes 
    up to a computer and so far they are great  perfect size since we have two monitors connected    
have had two of these hooked up to a computer and so far they are great  perfect size since we have two monitors connected and displayed on one desk
