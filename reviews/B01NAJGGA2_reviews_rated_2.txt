uncomfortable  headaches  poor ui
i have mpow 059 and mpow h2 bluetooth over ear headphones  mpow ipx7 bluetooth earbuds  sennheiser wireless headphones  and bose noise canceling wired headphones  the sennheiser  bose  and mpow earbuds are comfortable to wear for hours  the mpow 059 headphones clamp my head and give me headaches  i hate wearing them  the mpow h2 aren t any better  i took the rubber tips off the earbuds and they don t occlude my hearing  i e   i can hear normally  the mpow headphones block my hearing  but  unlike my bose noise cancelling headphones  the mpow headphones don t actively reduce background noise  if i need to reduce background noise  e g   on airplanes  then i ll wear my bose headphones  not the mpow headphones  clamping headphones tightly onto your ears isn t a good way to reduce background noise  lastly  i couldn t get the mpow headphone controls to work properly  the problem may be that i can t see the headphones controls with the headphones on  but i can t hear the messages when i take the headphones off  so i hold the button down too long or not long enough  and it goes into pairing mode when i want to power off the headphones  etc  in contrast  with the mpow earbuds i can remove the right earbud  with the controls  while leaving the left earbud in my ear  i can look at the controls on the right earbud and hold the correct button down until i hear the message in the left earbud   power off   etc  after a few hours i m starting to manipulate the controls without removing the earbud from my ear  the sennheiser headphones have separate switches and knobs for power  volume  and frequency  all of which are easy to use 
if you have a smaller head you may want to keep looking 
i read a ton of reviews before buying this product and i was super excited to love them and use them daily  however  i ran into a bit of a snag    first  all of the things i love about the mpow 059    they sync with my devices very quickly   quicker than my  300 headphones    i love that they talk to me and tell me what commands i have given   e g  push the power button and it will tell you  powering on  or if your headphones are already on it says  pairing   phone one paired     i love that i can feel the volume and track forward and back buttons easily   i love the ear padding  it feels good on your ears as opposed to the cheap snap crackle pop you get with some of the other ear covers out there  now for where things went wrong for me    the reviews i read mentioned a long charging cord one even showed a 4 ft cord in the review video  my charging chord was a little over a foot and a half  not a huge deal but certainly not helpful when i want to charge my headphones while wearing them in bed    the biggest challenge with these headphones was size  i had the headphones set at the smallest setting and there was no tension to keep them on my ears so the band across the top of the earphones put a painful amount of pressure on the top of my head  i wore them for a couple of days  adjusting the band on top of my head forward or back to try and alleviate the pain but no luck  i love so much about these headphones  i wish they worked for me but i just can t take head pain  i hesitate sending them back  i m not sure i want to deal with the hassle so i may just donate them to some lucky person  with a larger head   just be warned  if you have a smaller head you may want to keep looking  insert sad face here 
great headphones all around  read second update 
good crisp sound  not noise cancelling  but they do a good job of blocking exterior noise  i ride public transportation in chicago daily  so they are definitely tested  the range is good  never gives out no matter where my phone is  even when it s in my backpack  not a ton of bass  but not bad either  comfortable and good battery life  i use them daily and only plug them in to charge every other day and they have never died on me    update   the headphones have experienced their first true durability test  i went to put my hood on as i got off the bus and inadvertently knocked them off my head on to the hard cold concrete  i am six feet tall so it was a good drop  enough to scuff up the right earpiece and dislodge the plastic circle around the pairing button  i am happy to report that headphones still work perfectly and the plastic piece popped right back in  no damage at all other than the scuff mark  excellent headphones    2nd update   unfortunately these headphones that i loved so much have let me down  after less than six months of daily usage  the left earpiece has given out  there was no triggering event  one minute the earpiece worked and then it did not  as stated before  these headphones did survive a fall a few weeks back  but no events since  the failure was completely random  review reduced to two stars due to poor longevity 
muffled sound
upside is they re fairly comfortable  build quality seems good  and bluetooth paired just fine  you can use them over bluetooth  or 3 5mm  while plugged in to charge  although there s an audible electrical hum from the charger  no need to turn them on use battery if you plug in 3 5mm  the downside is that sound quality is incredibly poor   i e  iphone earbuds and panasonic ergofits provide much clearer sound  at the same price or less   the mids are present  but treble and bass are seriously lacking  sound is very muffled  i m honestly not sure if the set i received was defective  or if these are just cheaply made  i m returning them  update  mpow sent me an h2 set to try  these were better  but not great  i ended up purchasing sony mdr xb50ap earbuds  which sound much fuller for a few dollars less 
utterly disappointed  the cheaper mpows are much better and a steal for the price  returning these asap waste of money 
i m utterly disappointed in my headphones  other than amazing exterior build quality they need to focus more on sound quality  the balancing of voice to background music is overwhelming almost no sense of quality base just a bare vibe sounding for base  i previously bought mpow headphones before for cheaper they didn t look as good but they were about 10 dollars cheaper and sounded noticeably better the only thing these had on my previous one was build quality  comfort and better external sound buffering  i m an avid listener of music and with these it just seemed off and not pleasing in overall sound quality like i said before the cheaper not so good looking mpows are a much better buy  and for the price i expected better sound quality than the cheaper mpows i m giving it two stars because of the build quality and the shear comfort they provide  but those really doesn t matter if the sound is horrid 
everyone can hear what you re listening to
i bought these to use at the office  but when i tested them out at home after i received them  they leak sound like crazy  my wife could hear every word from several feet away at a normal volume  they sounded good  but i don t want my whole office hearing what i m listening to 
disappointed with audio quality
these are the first bluetooth over the ear headphones i have purchased so i don t have a basis for comparison with other brands or models  the price was good and the fit was fine for me  wearing comfort was ok but i haven t worn them for an extended period of time due to my issue with the audio quality  below   pairing was simple with my smartphone  operation with the buttons took a little getting used to but worked fine  i haven t used them enough to comment on battery life  my major complaint with these headphones is the quality of the sound  the audio was just dull sounding to me  mids and highs were poor and almost sounded muffled  bass was only ok  i played the same music with a set of recently purchased mpow bluetooth earbuds and there was no comparison  the earbuds audio was bright and realistic even though they cost about 1 2 the price of the over the ear headphones  edit 10 10 2017  my original review should have included the comment that for me the major complaint about the audio quality of these headphones is that vocals are coming through sounding muffled or dull and also seem to be at a lower level than the instrumentals on any track i listen to  instrumental only tracks sound ok  i unfortunately have just missed my 45 day money back return option so i m stuck with them  i just know i would not purchase this item again or recommend them to others  mpow bluetooth headphones over ear  hi fi stereo wireless headset  foldable  soft memory protein earmuffs  w  built in mic and wired mode for pc  cell phones  tv
this headset is just okay
one last update  one star added for bella s amazing attitude and customer service towards all this  the seller has finally contacted me and was wonderful in wanting to help me out in getting a new pair  however i did return them and didn t need a new pair  but bella was very nice and took the time to make sure i was taken care of  took longer then i would have liked to get this problem fixed but better late then never i always say     i am now giving this review one star  just for the simple fact that the seller didn t want to help me at all  if i could give it zero i would  after 4 failed attempts to contact the seller  i just returned them  you are way better off buying something else  i bought a new headset that s way better and was way cheaper as well  expensive doesn t always mean better  when i received this headset  it connected no problem to my ps4 slim  i guess it doesn t have wireless capabilities so i had to have them plugged into my controller  which wasn t a problem for me  just unexpected  they are very comfortable to wear and the charge lasted about 5 6 hours before i started to hear them cut in and out knowing i needed to charge them  i can not tell you how all the buttons work for i got a faulty headset  that s why i gave them 2 stars  i contacted the seller 3 times before just returning the headset and buying a different pair  not only did none of the buttons work but the right side of my headset didn t work at all 
weak sound  ears hurt and get hot 
the only reason im not giving one star is because these things were inexpensive  so sometimes you get what you pay for  i regret this purchase  the sound quality is very weak  i can barely hear the bass compared to other headphones i own that are the same price range  i even have some cheap earbuds that are way better sounding with deeper bass  i am disappointed also with how uncomfortable these are  i can only wear them for about 30 minutes and i have to take them off  they push in really hard and feel really tight on my ears  i guess that would be a good thing if you were outside jogging or doing yardwork or something  because they will definitely not come off easily  otherwise they are just painful after about a half hour  and also the make myvests super hot  it feels like theyre on fire  so  pain and hotness so uncomfortable  my old avantree bluetooth headphones are much more comfortable  eats dont get hot  and the sound quality is twice as good  especially the bass   and i paid about the same for them  if i had more time on my hands i would return these for a refund but i dont  i guess im just going to continue listening to my old headphones  maybe i will keep these as a backup pair but i do not recommend buying these  on the plus side  they do fold up  which most other over the ear bluetooth headphones do not  so they go in a smaller case  i also bought the case  other than that  i would not recommend  i guess i cant hit a homerun with everything i purchase on amazon  oh well  onward and upward 
may have to fiddle with it
update feb  2018   despite trying for months i have been unable to get these to work with my desktop  the product support team though responsive was ultimately unhelpful  they even sent me another component to try to pair with  all in all  though the headphones are good my overall experience was dissatisfying and these are now just lying around because the return window closed long back  reducing another star due to the whole bad experience                                   i ordered these last week alongwith a bluetooth dongle for my desktop  getting the mic to work on applications like discord  skype etc has been a pain  ultimately figured out i had to have the headphones paired  and turned on  before the desktop booted  for some reason  the mic doesn t work and picks up garbled junk if i pair it later on  not sure why and no idea if it is the fault of the headphones or the dongle but fwiw the overall experience wasn t smooth
good sound and comfortable but a pain to use
first  the good things about this headset  it is very comfortable  i can wear it all day  this is excellent for a noisy cube environment  when it s setup properly the stereo headphones sound great  the headset seems to work fine when you get it working  the batteries do last all day  i ve not had them run out on me yet and i leave the headset on all day while at work and plug it in to charge it up overnight when i leave for the day  it s also great to be wireless  now the negatives that are causing me to give this a 2 star review  i have this connected to my windows 10 computer via bluetooth  for some reason when you pair the headset to your computer it shows up as 2 devices  the stereo headphones and a hands free headset  when one is activated the other doesn t work so when i want to use these to talk on my jabber soft phone i have to go and change settings that effectively shut off the headphone features and enable the headset  for some apps i have to go into the headset properties in windows 10 and turn on  listen to this device  to get it so windows will hear the microphone  the problem with this is it disables the headphones and i cannot listen to music while that option is enabled unless i listen through the  hands free headset  device which sounds horrible for music  mono and just doesn t sound good   maybe this is a windows issue  but usb headsets don t have all these configuration complications  i ve been able to make it work but it s a pain  and continues to be a pain switching between hands free and headphone mode 
so so  
comfortable  sound pretty good  match my computer chair  the optional plug in or bluetooth feature is nice  future updates later  update  01 07 2018 the headsets are ok  nothing stellar  bluetooth is problematic to connect with from time to time  cuts in and out  no 33 foot range as stated  the sound quality is ok  nothing stellar  update  03 06 2018 just noticed you cant plug them in and utilize the corded feature to listen and charge the headsets at the same time  also while pulled in there is a hissing sound in the background  will be looking for another headset as the bluetooth has now began to cut in and out enough to be annoying  as the computer is right in front of me  but on the other hand they look really good 
needs an auto off or sleep option
pros   very comfortable  great price  stylish  great clear sound  strong battery life cons   claims to be better than anc but they aren t at all the biggest con for me is that there is no sleep or auto off option  i wanted to use these at night in bed to listen to my white noise app thru bluetooth from my cell phone  what i found out quickly is that because they never turn off  my morning alarm came on thru the headphones that i had thrown off to the floor the night before  so frustrating 
nice headphones  died after less than 6 months  customer service was less than ideal
first  these headphones are great  i bought them for a work trip that had me doing a lot of travel  they re comfortable  they block outside noise well  they fold down nice  the controls are easy to use  they sound good  the battery life is solid  they quickly became a part of my every day  i was using these things all the time and thrilled that they were so nice for such a reasonable price  then the battery died  i hadn t even had them for 6 months and the battery died  what i should have done here is go through amazon to deal with this  but i contacted mpow directly  they responded reasonably quickly and asked that i send the headphones back to them  they said they would check them and send back replacements  they even covered my shipping costs  at this point i was entirely satisfied with the process  things break  parts die  i get it  but this is where it went south    after an extended wait  i received my replacement headphones  they were all scratched up  the hinges were loose  the ear padding was beat up  the play pause button looked like someone had taken a thumb tack to it  and the line in jack was all beat up  they looked like hell  on top of that  one end of the line in cable was snapped off  i don t know if they worked  i never tried them  when i contacted mpow about it  they just said to send them back and they would issue a refund  that s fine  but what i wanted was a working pair of headphones  i ve now spent several weeks dealing with this  and have a bad taste in my mouth about mpow  it s an acceptable outcome  i guess  but i m really disappointed at how the whole interaction went  so  these are really nice headphones  they had become essential gear for my everyday workflow  when they died  mpow basically shrugged  i got my money back  which is nice  but what i wanted was working headphones that hadn t spent three weeks in the bottom of a high schooler s backpack 
i had these for two months and loved them  i even bought a second pair for    
i had these for two months and loved them  i even bought a second pair for my son  i charged them two times  and they worked perfectly  then  mysteriously  i charged them again  and they no longer will hold a charge  i can connect to my phone when they are on the charger  but when i remove them  they don t work  obviously  i want them for their bluetooth capability  pretty frustrating  1 19 2018 update the folks at patozon  who sold me this item  sent me a replacement shortly after i complained  i ve had it for a couple of months now  and it works beautifully  they ve checked in numerous times to ensure my satisfaction  i can tell you now that this is the best headset for the money anywhere  and patozon is a marvelous company  don t delay  grab you mpow headphones today
