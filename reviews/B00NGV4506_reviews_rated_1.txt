blender jar exploded 
i ve had my ninja for about 18 months  i loved it  used primarily for smoothies with frozen fruit  the other day it exploded on me and tore a hole through it  i have contacted ninja  they didn t seem too concerned about it  and when i pressed them and offered to send them the defective blender jar so they could figure out the defect  they didn t seem very interested  the email they gave me was incorrect so i have to call them again to try and pursue this  i don t want another one  i just want them check it out because obviously there is an issue 
poor plastic  broke within 8 months with little usage  do not recommend  costly warranty 
bought on october 6  2016  one of the clip that locks the lid on broke off after minimal usage  the broken clip prevents the blender lid from locking and deactivating the safety  rendering the blender useless  their warranty states that i will have to pay  19 95 to cover the cost of returning a replacement  factor in the cost to ship the broken blender to them  that would be 40 45  of the original purchase price  i would not recommend this blender  stick with glass container versus plastic 
broke after three uses
after three uses a crack developed along the bottom of the pitcher from one end to the other  the only thing i ever blended was fruit  their warranty states that i will have to pay  19 95 for shipping to have it replaced  at 20  of the purchase price  i don t even know if it s worth it  based on my experience  i do not recommend this blender 
piece of  s ierra  h otel  i ndia  t ango
nice concept however  the entire operations and use comes down to a improperly designed and fragile tab that is easy to break off and renders the blender useless  after the fact  i have read this is a common problem with the blender  see red light blinks   now i have a 1000watt paper weight  i purchased the extended warranty from square trade via amazon and the just referred me to the manufacture  not what i expected  will not purchase from manufacture again  amazon  you let me down 
the blender that cracks and breaks when you wash it in a dishwasher  yikes
i bought this blender as i thought this would be a solid blender to make my smoothies  boy was i wrong  i am an avid juicer  and normally also love smoothies  when i bought this blender i was not trying to chop up onions or anything hard and crazy just making a shake and something easy to clean  however after 2 3 washes in the dishwasher i saw a crack and on top of the crack i also saw this blender leak all over my counter  its disgusting and time consuming to clean the actual blender for all the droplets of my smoothie and it just makes a huge mess  if you want a solid blender this is not the one guys look for a glass blender 
zero stars   leaked after only 6 weeks of use
if i could leave zero stars i would  we purchased this to make bullet proof coffee  and that is all it was used for in the six weeks we had it in our possession  we used it twice daily for 6 weeks to blend coffee with butter and mct oil  we blended for a maximum of 60 seconds each time we used it  we never used ice in the machine while we owned it  after only six weeks  it began leaking at the base where the blade attaches  there was no way for us to tighten anything  for the amount of money we paid for it  this was a huge disappointment   professional     yeah right    this is not a professional blender  pros  it blended our contents quickly and efficiently  albeit  it was only coffee and butter  other cons  the carafe is plastic  not glass  i knew this when i ordered it  but i just cannot understand what s so hard about making a blender that is made with glass and metal  i owned an oster for 20 years and it was awesome until the blade started to leak  and when we replaced it  the  oem part  cracked within 2 months  they just don t make appliances like they use to 20 years ago  also  this blender is huuuuuuge  it wouldn t even fit under my cabinets  so i had to leave the carafe off and sit it to the side  taking up twice as much of my counter top space  also  it s very loud  but most blenders are  we never had any issues with the blade  flying out at us  like one review we read  you just have to be careful when pouring  which is where the spot comes in handy  or remove the blade to pour your contents  would i purchase it again or recommend this product  absolutely not  i had the option to exchange it  but if an appliance can show that kind of poor design after only 6 weeks  i don t want anything to do with it  we went back to an oster    with a glass carafe  and so far it s working great   
lasted one month  cracked and broken  leaks 
this lasted about a month before the pitcher cracked on the bottom and started leaking  also  one of the black plastic feet on the pitcher broke off  this blender is ridiculously awful
worst blender
absolutely the worst blender i have ever purchased  i used it all of three times and the light wouldn t stop flashing even though i had it aligned properly  i called customer service and they were absolutely useless  turns out that even though the blender says dish washer safe you can only put it on the top shelf which doesn t make sense because it s too big to fit on any standard dishwashers top shelf  apparently a piece on the jug melted off in the dishwasher  needless to say i am never buying one of their products again 
poor quality construction 
the blender jar cracked and leaks after just 1 and half months of light use  it was not dropped or slammed  just cracked by the spinning part at the bottom  very dissapointed 
read before you buy  warranty info 
i wanted to really like this product based on all the positive reviews i read  i bought it in august  and now it s november and the pitcher has cracked  i used it may be once a week to blend smoothies  the pitcher is not covered by their 1 year warranty  which is ridiculous  like it s an extra part or something  to return the product you have to pay  19 99  is it worth it  you decide for yourself 
hate it  so let me start by saying that    
hate it  so let me start by saying that i had a real ninja before this one  i dropped it and broke it so here i go and purchase this one for a great deal  unfortunately when this blender arrived and from the very first time i used it  once i turn it on to blend the contents splash out through the top  i guess the lid doesnt fit properly or maybe its the rubber on the lid that isnt good  either way in order for it not to splash out  i need to tightly hold down the lid while it blends  and when its time to pour  im supposed to easily lift the corner and pour  however when i pour it comes pouring out around the whole lid making a huge mess  i have to remove the entire lid and blade in order to free pour  big waste of my money and time 
but this is such a horrible blender for what you pay
i never write reviews  but this is such a horrible blender for what you pay  i had to write a review  another reviewer wrote it takes the smooth out of smoothie and he couldnt be more right  im not sure how this blender got so many good reviews  so many times i tried making my smoothies and aa bowls and had to stick a spoon in the blender and push all the chunks to the center because they wouldnt blend  i end up dumping my smoothie into my nitribullet to get all the chunks out of it  the designers went wrong when they decided to put three sets of blades going up   all it does is send everything flying to the sides  making me have to constantly scrape the sides of the blender  the lowest setting is still too high  ugh  i need a vitamix 
stopped working after 6 months
not even 6 months old  only used maybe 10 times  stoped working  power button blinks but nothing works  i have all the arrows lined up  everything on right  nothing  went online and so many people bought this blender have same problem  waste of money  no stars for me
worst blender ever
as someone else mentioned in their review  this blender takes the  smooth  out of  smoothie   no matter how long i blend  there are still massive chunks in my  smoothie   and it s nearly undrinkable  look at the variety of user uploaded photos and you ll see what i mean  also  this blender was shipped in it s original box  with no discreet packaging whatsoever  so the whole neighborhood  including potential thieves  knew exactly what it was as it sat on my front porch  it also means that the box i have to return it in  the original packaging  is already beat up from shipping the first time  i honestly have no idea how this blender has been so popular  it is the worst blender i have ever used  including other cheaper blenders
