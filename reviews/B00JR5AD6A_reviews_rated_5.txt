the quintessential blender
just bought this inexpensive blender for my bro because his old one broke  pros    sturdy and made from strong metal and plastic   32oz is a great amount of space for blending opportunities   the two 16oz jars are convenient sizes for smaller blends   simple on and off buttons anyone could use   fast and durable blade that cuts through even the most unyielding fruit   sleek design and fashionable color scheme   easy to clean   extremely affordable cons    travel lids could have been built to be more secure   pouring from the 32oz into another cup is not as smooth as it could be overall  fantastic blender especially at such a low price point  it outperforms blenders that are two or three times as expensive and carries out the basic functions smoothly 
great for families 
this is my favorite blender yet  we make a lot of smoothies   milkshakes but the kids like different flavors than the adults do  i make the kids shakes in the 32 oz  my husband s protein shake in the 16oz and my fruit smoothie in the other 16oz  thanks to the versatility of this awesome blender set now i can easily make everybody s shakes and smoothies in minutes  we use this all the time and absolutely love it 
excellent smoothie mixer for the price   
awesome for what it is    a cost effective smoothie mixer  please don t buy this thinking you re getting a top of the line food processor or juicer for a bargain  it s not designed for that  i love using it for protein or fruit yogurt smoothies  chops up ice relatively well if you do the cubes a few at a time when there s liquid  i ve been using this thing every day for the past couple of months and no issues so far  cleans up super easy as well 
super blender
great  smaller blender for folks who don t need bells and whistles  smooth operation  great function  and i ve made great use of the mini cups for smaller jobs  doesn t take a lot of room on the counter  and has a nice sleek  modern look  definitely worth the money 
found the perfect smoothie maker
just what i wanted  i have a smaller blender that does about two cups at a time  and i have had bigger blenders that are just too big and heavy with the thick glass pitchers  this is perfect  we make smoothies and milkshakes for the kids  one at a time  if tastes vary  or mix a few in the bigger pitcher  we really love the option of blending in the  take with you  cups 
a good purchase 
i actually love this blender  proud owner of a vitamix here  i needed something a little smaller as the vitamix takes up a lot of counter space  this little guy is awesome  i would not suggest use all frozen fruits to make a smoothie with this  its not powerful enough  i defrosted my fruits for my smoothie and i used a couple frozen fruit pieces to substitute for ice  with a scoop of natures bounty vitamin and protein mix  it was smooth and delicious  also this little guy doesnt make that much noise 
works great  very convenient 
this is an awesome little blender  i make smoothies in it just about every day  make sure that you re adding enough liquid  and use pulse to chop up frozen fruit ice  sometimes when i blend in the cup i have to take it off the blender and give it a little shake to move stuff around  but it s not a big deal to do so 
awesome blender  since everything come apart
awesome blender  since everything come apart  it s really easy to clean  and it s useful for not only blended drinks  but also making pesto and the like  we use it near daily  so it gets washed a lot  the only thing i would caution someone on is that i wouldn t put it in the dishwasher  even though it says top rack safe  after unfortunate incidents with another blender and some plastic cups    i wouldn t recommend doing that 
and i m so happy i did
my son and i have been on a  smoothie kick  lately  so i purchased this  stay or go  blender  and i m so happy i did  we ve been using it every day  sometimes twice a day  for about a week  it works great with frozen fruit  as long as you add enough liquid   and clean up is a breeze  love the options of the pitcher and or  to go  cups  as well     we use both  it s much more quiet than my former blender     which is great  i highly recommend this product to anyone who makes smoothies 
great  cheap  blender
great little blender  love that it has the different containers  i can assemble 3 smoothies at a time  which works great for the toddlers   it is not very powerful  if you want to mix up greens you will have to let it blend  blend  blend  if i use ice  i use the crushed ice from the ice maker to give it a head start  as a previous reviewer said  it s a  small footprint  on the counter and that s great for smaller kitchen or limited counter space  overall  it s a nice  cheap   small blender and works well for our needs   
    been using the blender for basic smoothies and i love it  i ve put ice cubes and frozen fruit    
i ve been using the blender for basic smoothies and i love it  i ve put ice cubes and frozen fruit in and haven t had a problem  i would highly recommend  but can t attest to more complex blending ingredients 
good basic blender 
okay  so this is a simple blender for simple easy jobs  don t think that in purchasing this that you are getting some super high powered blender  in my house  we use it to make our smoothies  it does the job  takes a bit of time but  for the price  it s a good blender  i do think that next time  i will go for something with more power 
sleek blender
love my blender  use it for protein shakes  milkshakes  smoothies  you name it  would suggest doing a quick pulse before just blending a lot of foods  i like the add ons that come with the blender

loved this whole set
loved this whole set  so easy to use  very well priced  item came fast  in great packaging  you can attach the blade right onto the two to go containers  as well as the mini one  i use the mini one for cheese mostly  the fact that you can attach the blade straight to the containers eliminates pouring and extra cleaning from the equation  i would definitely recommend  i ve had this product for almost eight months now and it still works like new 
five stars

going to be perfect for our camper this spring and great right now for both me and husband protein energy drinks before gym workout  really like the portable small but  powerful for our small travel trailer right now too 
strong engine
even though its loud  the engine is very strong  its very easy to clean  i like its simplicity  arrived well packaged and fast  the top is easy to open  when using full blender  try to keep content 2inches away from the top because it spilled over a few times 
worth it 
it is smaller than i expected but don t let that fool you  it s powerful and it definetly gets the job done  in about 5 seconds i have myself a smoothie lol and i m talking with ice and all that

small and efficient  perfect for exactly what i bought it for  smoothies  milkshakes and alcoholic beverages  not a heavy duty blender but you get what you pay for and it s definitely worth the price
