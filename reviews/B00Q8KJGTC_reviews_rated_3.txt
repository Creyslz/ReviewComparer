nice 3 shelves for the price  works with command picture hangers 
these shelves are pretty good  they arrived on time  with a little bit of damage  obviously by the manufacturer  not s h  as they come in a 3 set  wrapped in celephane  or shrink wrap type plastic  surrounded by large air pocket bubble wrap style plastic strips  a few scratches here and there  and an odd powdery dirt like substance on everything  luckily the scratches are on the underside of the shelves so its no big deal  you cant see them once hung  i never intended to use the screw set  so i didnt even look at it  my appt  has a very strict no damage policy  even to excessive thumbtacks  i saw some rewiews stating these could work with command hooks  so i gave them a shot  luckily  they do  only with the large universal picture hangers  silver metal  though  since they hook right into the back  are easily removable  and are designed to support a good amount of weight  regular sawtooth holders  poster strips  clips  mini clips ect  just wont support the weight of the shelf alone  let alone anything you desire to place on it  along with the wider hook not fitting into the narrow opening designed for a screw  it can get a little pricy  as each set of 3 shelves will require 6 hooks  and the hooks only come in packs of 3 hooks pack  if you can tolerate seeing the excess silver hook at all times  and cant afford to damage the walls  this is a solid  stylish  and pretty practical option  i ended up getting 3 sets of 3 total  for art supplies  and whatnot  they ve been up for days  and so far so good 
the screws are straight garbage
my fianc insisted i give this a one star so please know that im being nice  two of the screws broke in my wall  were going to have to dig them out and patch the wall  so this product literally damaged my house  only reason im giving it a 3 instead of a 1 is because i read reviews saying not to use the screws provided and still did it anyway  so that part is my fault  but still  the damage is done and its really inexcusable to be selling the shelves with screws the the seller  knows  are garbage  theyve had more than enough reviews telling them so and havent swapped them  so learn from my mistake and buy your own screws  or get different shelves 
easy return so it might be worth a shot if    
i returned this without even removing them from the box  they appeared to be well constructed and were in the size range that i needed  but the wood of the shelf and the plastic trim on the pressboard edge were two different white tones  the edge was a more blue white while the shelf was a more eggshell  it may work in some environments  or with different lighting   we use soft lighting in the 2700k range   but it caught my eye in a way i couldn t stand  easy return so it might be worth a shot if you love them 
pretty shelving solution
love the look of these  they are sturdy enough for my purposes  only issue is the sheetrock anchors that ship with them are useless  ended up using my own higher quality  shame for the company to skimp on such an important aspect of the design  would order again and recommend them 
i wanted to love these shelves so much
i wanted to love these shelves so much  when i read the dimensions  i must ve read them wrong because these shelves are tiny  they also cannot hold much weight  i have them mounted above my art desk to hold my paints  they are sturdy enough to hold them and not move  but i wouldn t trust them to hold anything fragile 
overall a good product  i bought these thinking they would be    
overall a good product  i bought these thinking they would be able to hold books and folders  they aren t quite wide enough to do so  i found some uses for these in my bathroom to hold some items  the drywall anchors would be better if they had a lip on them so that they do not go too deep into the wall  not a bad product for the price though  would recommend if you need something inexpensive to hold some smaller items 
listen to reviews i didnt
im giving this 3 stars for the shelves themselves  however  the mollies were horrible and un usablewe had to get better ones  the screws also broke in half as we were putting them in so they were cheap   so if you buy this go out and buy better screws and mollies  or just buy higher rated u shelves with better reviews 
floating over my head
very attractive but not as deep as i thought they would be  that s on me for not reading the dimensions properly  they were kind of a hassle to hang  but i m not at all handy  and i ended up using at least one as a fashionable book holder of sorts on top of another surface in my apartment  they are nice for holding n64 cartridges if you have some around 
meh  i got what i paid for 
i m kind of  meh  about the shelves  i basically got what i paid for  cheap shelves  don t get me wrong  i m still going to use them  i bought them for our guest bathroom  mostly just to put a few knickknacks on  i think once they re up they ll serve their intended purpose  however  i m not 100  sure that the shelves will actually stay on the wall  the anchors they came with are literal garbage  save yourself a headache  throw them out and go buy better ones  and maybe some brackets to keep the shelves stable 
too narrow for much use
these are decent quality for the price and are easy to install  they come with a paper that has the screw hole distances pre measured for you  however  they are incredibly narrow  i bought them to replace a broken bookshelf for my son and they are so narrow they do not even fit chapter books  i really don t know what they might hold beyond keys or trinkets    they don t even hold dvd s  i would not trust these shelves to hold anything fragile  either  as they are not 100  stable when installed  they stay on the wall but jiggle if touched 
it s okay
not very sturdy  the large one broke 3 minutes after i put it up  i decided to use my own nails and techniques instead of the ones given  and they hold up a lot better now  not the best quality  but works
