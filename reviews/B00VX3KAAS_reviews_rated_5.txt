triple monitor heaven
just purchased 3 of these monitors and they look amazing see for yourself in my picture  
great buy for a great price 
excellent monitor especially for the price  i have had no problem with this monitor in fact ive had one for a year now and i just bought another when i ordered my computer to build  these monitors side by side look great and perform great as well  i am hoping to get a mount for my desk when i am able to and these will be able to mount because they have the vesa mounting spots on the back of the monitor 
it is overclockable to 85hz
in case anyone is wondering you can oc this minister to 85fps and i saw this was confirmed by someone else as well in an answered question  for nvidia users its easy to into nvidia control panel not geforce experience   then go to change display  click customize display  check enable resolutions not exposed by the display and click create custom resolution  you can do any resolution you want up to even the native resolution of 2560 x 1440p at 85 hz  keep on progressive and automatic timing works fine  i know it works on display port and if i remember right dvi as long as its dual link  i m not sure about hdmi  amd users can do it as well but not through the catalyst  just google cru monitor overclocking utility  after you download the software you extract the contents and set your resolution to whatever you want and hz to 85 and after you add it go back to the cru utility files you just dled and reset the display driver and you re good  from there change your refresh rate how you normally would 
once you go 1440p  you don t go back  must buy for non or light gamers  heavy gamers read on 
i ve been saving money to upgrade my 32  720p tv even though it s still going strong for almost 4 years because  1  it s on my desk and it takes up a lot of space 2  while 720p is easier on my graphics card  the image quality basically cancels out how easily i can max out most settings on modern games  i would say when i m at a monitor  1 3 of the time i m gaming the other 2 3 are just basic web browsing and youtube consumption  720p on a 32 inch tv sitting less than 6 feet from it would probably make most enthusiast pc gamers either cringe or cry  or both   i knew that while the 2 3rds i spend doing non gaming activities would benefit from a higher resolution  my gpu would choke on it  i have been eyeing this acer monitor because of how affordable it is  get it at  279  definitely get it right now at  249  and because it s a 1440p resolution which is higher than the standard 1080p  so does paying less equal less quality  with this monitor  i think not  i will list the pros and cons briefly and go into more detail below  pros  very bright  i believe it s at 80 at default which is okay in the daytime but at night it s way too bright and i found 45 to be a sweet spot   ips display  vibrant colors at wide viewing angles  everyone needs an ips monitor unless you are those competitive gamers who need 144 hz monitors that right now are great for multiplayer games but have terrible colors and poor viewing angles   very affordable  a lot of high end 1080p monitors are around this price and while most are around  150  200  i feel it s worth extra to go to 1440p especially if you do more web browsing than gaming  neutral quality  my monitor came with absolutely no dead pixels and very faint backlight bleed common for ips displays  i guess i won the monitor lottery  this will vary  but my experience was positive however i will leave this as a neutral as not all panels are made the same  mine was made in april of this yer   cons  very flimsy stand  yes the other reviewers are right  the stand is quite bad  when you try to adjust the vertical height of the monitor it will shake  you can t adjust it horizontally nor can you turn it sideways like the dell ultrasharp s  it is easy to install the stand though    no vesa mounts  ties into the flimsy stand because you re stuck with that stand  some people will find a lack of vesa mounts to be a nonstarter  for me  i can live with a flimsy stand when everything else about this monitor is a solid a   in the box it comes with a dvi cable and an hdmi cable but not a display port cable  something to note  so if you re not a gamer  the rest of this review you can skip  i will say to buy this monitor if you aren t a gamer because of the affordability  and the great display at 1440p resolution  now  for the gamers  the higher the resolution the more your fps is decreased  if you absolutely must have a solid 60fps experience  you will need at least a gtx 970 or a r9 290x if you re okay with dialing down some key settings like aa and shadows for 60fps or a gtx 980 ti or what amd is going to release on july 16th at e3 if you want to have your cake and eat it too  max everything and solid above 60fps   i have a amd r9 270  which is definitely on the lower end of the gpu spectrum so how does it fare at 1440p  playing a demanding game like the witcher 3  i can max out some settings  dial down the foliage distance  huge fps eater  and get rid of hairworks  even bigger for amd and nvidia cards  and i can get a solid 30fps  it s not 60  but if you re of the graphics   fps affinity  you can definitely use a lower end gpu at 1440p like the r9 270  280 and for nvidia the 960  it s up to you what you want more of  but what is not disputable is just how much of a steal this monitor is and it will make your games look like you re actually in them  i stared at the witcher 3 for almost 10 minutes just because how gorgeous it looks and why ips monitors are always superior to other panels  1440p is not as big of a jump as 4k  but it is a big improvement over 1080p  the question is  do you need a new graphics card or not 
this is an awesome inexpensive 2k monitor  i plan on buying a second one 
i ve only had this monitor for 2 day  however since there are barely any reviews for this product  i shall state my initial impressions  this really is a gorgeous monitor  so far i haven t come across any issues  one customer stated that they had dead pixels right off the bat  however i do not  so  they other customer may have just gotten one of the few bad monitors  though i suppose it s also possible that i m one of the few who got a good monitor  only time will tell when more people buy the product and more reviews are written  anyways  i definitely recommend this monitor  it s one of the least expensive 2k monitors and yet it s specs are pretty good and it is pleasing to the eye  with such a tiny bezel  this monitor is great for people who like using multiple monitors  plus  unlike the acer g257hu  you can tilt the screen without messing around with screws and the price is lower  i surely plan on buying another by the end of this year  most of the other monitors i saw around this price were from lesser known brands  they were terribly ugly  and the specs were a tad worse 
great picture quality at the price that wont break you 
i needed a monitor to attach to my laptop when i take my work home  this one fits the budget so i thought i d give it a try  upon receiving the item i immediately inspected the physical built of this monitor and i was surprise that it does not look cheap at all  in fact  it looks even better than other monitors i ve seen from local stores which cost twice as much  but the more important part of this review is the image quality  i am no expert but this monitor makes everything look better than the laptop it s connected too  the white is pure white unlike other monitors i ve seen where white is too bluish or yellowish  adjusting the picture quality is very easy  i didn t even need to read the manual  i ve been using this monitor for months now and i have nothing bad to report  if you are looking for an inexpensive monitor that provides good picture quality  i recommend you try this  i do t use it for gaming but for work use and occasional movie watching it is more than enough  this is definitely a good purchase for me 
exceptional monitor  happy customer  
very happy with this purchase  my cat knocked over my old dell 24  lcd monitor and the warranty expired two months before  i did not wanna pay for another low quality monitor  i work from home most weekends so this was an emergency  since i had some money left on my amazon gift card  i used that to buy this monitor  i used this monitor at my former job except i think it had to be a 19   it also had an hdmi port  this one does not  but because it comes with the vga cord and the largest white cord  i easily plugged it into my docking station and after fiddling with the screen resolution it works perfectly  i am okay with the fact that it does not tilt  i have no complaints about the resolution  a lot of reviews seem to be nitpicking about the tilt and resolution but instead of being cheap    just search for a monitor that tilts and has good resolution  reading is fundamental  update  it tilts slightly up and down  regardless  still a great monitor
i love this monitor
i love this monitor  i actually bought this monitor and an asus mx25aq at the same time  because i couldn t decide based on reviews of both monitors  when i turned on the mx25aq  i kept trying to adjust the settings because i couldn t read the text  then i turned on this monitor and was completely blown away by the superb quality  check out pictures  i am very happy with this purchase  now  like most people have said  i have had a problem with the displayport input  so i rely on 4k hdmi cables and a 2k dvi cable  which work just fine  another valid complaint is why on earth did this monitor not come vesa compatible  especially when the stand is so cheap and flimsy looking  oh well  i found a solution using instructions found here       allsteps  you can see the pics of the end result 
great monitor for the price   
bought four of them on the amazon prime day for a steal to give to some employees  i was scared off by some negative reviews so i cancelled two of them  now i regret it because these are solid desktop monitors  no mounts or swivel  but for this price it works for me  the screen looks fantastic for the low price i paid  huge screen  edge to edge viewing  i just wish they d go back on sale again and i d get 4 more  it doesn t rotate but i bought a 12 inch bluecell rotating lazy susan to throw it on and it looks and works great 
more room for activities 
upgraded to this monitor from an old 24 inch samsung 1080p monitor  and i could not be more happy  i went back and forth on 25 inches vs 27 inches at this resolution  and decided to give this acer g257hu a shot  the slightly greater pixel density was a factor but i bet the larger 27 inch 2560x1440 resolution monitors look great too  this is an ips panel so the viewing angles are amazing  i can walk into my office and see the screen from any angle with no washed out effect that many tn panels produce at angles that aren t straight on  the difference in color contrast between my old monitor and this new acer is insane  this monitor produces gorgeous colors and makes photo editing and viewing a treat  when i first hooked up this monitor to my windows 10 pc  windows automatically set the monitor resolution to 2560x1440 but also scaled the size of text and everything to greater than 100   i think this is automatic on microsoft s part  but i set the scaling back to 100  to take advantage of the full screen real estate  and trust me  the advantage of wqhd  2560x1440  over hd  1920x1080  is great  giving me more room to have my email client open along with everything else i need to be productive at work  if you want to upgrade your screen real estate  this monitor is an awesome choice 
this monitor is one of the best purchases i ve made in the last few years  can t be beaten for the price 
intro  this monitor is one of the best purchases i ve made in the last few years  when i bought this about 18 months ago  i was in dire need of an upgrade  my 1080p monitor was about 5 6 years old at that point  and the age was starting to show  i m not enough of an early adopter to go for 4k yet  so i tried to find something in the mid range  i also don t quite have the budget to go for state of the art equipment every time  so when i m shopping for electronics i aim for about tier 2  there aren t a whole lot of monitors that can output 1440p  3k   and almost none under  350  at least that was the case at the time  there seems to be a much better selection now  there is even a 23 inch version of this one that i am very tempted by  impressions  when i found this  i honestly thought something had to be mislabeled because it was about  200 cheaper than every other 1440p monitor  but i bought it and have been beyond satisfied with it  games and movies look absolutely frickin gorgeous on it  the desktop space is endless  colors are vibrant and true  text and lines are sharp  no complaints about response time or refresh rate  though 4ms isn t the fastest monitor i ve ever had  i think the chassis looks great with the paper thin black frame around all but the bottom  and the mix of black and silver  my brother is more of an hd aficionado than i am  and he is blown away by this display as well  concessions  apparently there are some complaints about the lack of tilt  that hasn t been an issue for me  it tilts some  just not a lot  also  the lack of vesa is a problem for a lot of people  which i understand  my setup isn t conducive to wall mounting so again  not an issue for me  bottom line  getting this monitor for  259 felt like a steal at the time  and still does  playing games at 1440p is a world apart from 1080p  and it s the perfect upgrade while we wait for the 4k market to find its legs a little more  preferably the feet  if you know what i mean   i will likely be buying 2 more of these when i upgrade my pc for triple monitors  in fact  these things are gonna make me try a 2x gpu setup instead of rebuilding the whole tower just so i can do it sooner  better get some water cooling  anyway  in conclusion  this screen might have been matched by some copycats by now  but for the price it can t be beat  unless there s one with vesa and you need that  yadda yadda  yup  good monitor 
quality pc monitor   reviewed by highly skilled pc gamer 
if you want a good gaming monitor with good color detailing   all  this is the monitor for you  it s not a asus but acer has better color quality   is actually more detailed   vivid i know of this because my friend has a asus and we compare the differences often  it s at a reasonable price you can t beat for the quality monitor that you receive  i personally use 3 of these 24  acer monitors for my gaming  i m a very avid gamer with over 12  games for pc   spend 50  hours a week on world of warcraft in 3v3 arenas high rated pvp bracket  it does the job for me and i personally am sticking with acer after testing out other monitors as far as performance   quality image goes  don t hesitate  just buy it already      axxo
the color on both is great  as are the viewing angles
i ve had both this acer g257hu and asus pb258q on my desk at the same time  the asus at normal price is almost  150 more  but you wouldn t be able to tell looking at the screens  the color on both is great  as are the viewing angles  and i wasn t able to see any visible light bleed on either  i m not a professional graphic artist  but i have to say i think the color on both are very good  if you like this sort of thing  the colors on the acer g257hu pop just a  tiny  bit more and i mean tiny  this though does have to be taken with a grain of salt as monitors in their default settings are designed to look good on a shelf and not be a proper accurate calibration  i messed with the color of both and found adding any additional contrast or brightness to the acer slightly washed out the image  i will say though that i was extremely pleased with the image quality of both  no complaints  for a budget or mid range pc monitor to be used for games  web browsing and watching movies they are wonderful  if you re a professional graphic artist you ll likely have to spend more on a true 10 bit panel  and while you ll see the difference  i m not sure the rest of us will  response times are rated at 4ms  acer  and 5ms  asus   but this difference was imperceptible to me  an absolute draw  since i m into games  and coming from a 144hz 1080p monitor the blur and overclocking were very important to me  both are weirdly a draw here too  the asus would not overclock for me  anything about 3hz over the default 60hz would black out the screen  yours asus pb258q might overclock  but mine won t  the acer overclocked like a champ being stable at 85hz  or so it seemed  i ran the online framskipping test to make sure it was truly achieving 85hz  and it passed  but in games it was garbage  at 70 75 80 and 85 hz multiple games i tested  project cars and bf4  the games looked noticeably less smooth  both games on ultra are around 100 120fps stable on my 980  the image was less smooth and looked like it was actually running at a lower than 60fps at any hz over 60  70   85 all looked the same  and less smooth than 60hz  my unprofessional opinion is that the acer would functionally not overclock  both monitors have about an equal amount of screen tearing  a normal amount for a 60hz monitor  a little annoying but you can live with it  the only solutions are g or free sync or 144hz  bezels are small and seemed to be equal on both  i like the 25inch screen  the pixel density and higher  and i like the smaller size verses 27  which you often see on 1440p and 4k monitors  both have an odd visual choice  the asus has a ever so slightly visible ruler on the bottom of the frame  in good light you can see it and it is a little weird  so crazy choice by asus  or crazy like a fox  in the short time i ve had the asus  i ve already used the ruled on the bottom of the screen to measure something  the acer is all black  except the large silver strip on the bottom of the bezel  not wild about two toned  and the silver made the screen look smaller  with a retail price about  125 150 more on the asus  what are you getting  a much better stand  the acer stand is pretty standard cheap fair  it was easy to assemble and wasn t so flimsy it scared me  i don t think it would fall apart  or jump off your desk if it was touched  but it is cheap and there is no getting around it  the asus stand is very nice  it was easy to assemble  heavier  sturdier and adjustable  it even pivots 90 degrees if you re into long spreadsheets  build quality is good  really close to my 144hz benq monitor i love  i decided to keep the asus pb258q for three reasons  1  this monitor is mostly for my wife  and she liked how the asus looks  subjective but still  2  my wife and i liked the adjustability of the stand and thought it would be more comfortable for doing schoolwork  3  would i pay the extra  150 for the asus just to get the better stand  no way  but when i bought it i got a great deal on the asus  when i purchased them  the price difference was only  70  i was torn  but decided to spend the extra cash on the better strand  should you buy the acer g257hu  yes  in a heartbeat  it is an absolute steal at  250  275  this is  the  budget 1440p monitor 
you should buy this monitor
not wanting to spend  500  on a 4k monitor  well  buy this inexpensive 2k monitor  this thing has some really nice whites and super dark blacks  the response time is good to above average  it s bright and colorful  crisp  all the reviews i saw about how wobbly it was is honestly an overstatement exaggeration  i guess i just fixed mine up a little better   shrugs  i noticed someone complained about the long wait as this monitor powers on  it s simple  go to the menu settings and enable the setting   quick startup   it s that simple  then the monitor instantly turns on  seriously  it s that simple  i am a gaming enthusiast  i am running an nvidia gtx 1070  amd fx 8350 black edition  16 gb ram  the glory is real  this monitor is an amazing pair with the hardware i am using  it s flawless in 2k  2560x1440  and even runs superb rendered to 4k resolutions  shadow of mordor is phenomenal and runs at 60 fps  witcher shreds  arma iii is a delight  i also do graphic design so i wanted something more clear  i feel like now every pixel is much clearer and stands out  it s truly a gorgeous monitor for it s price  yes  the refresh rate is 60hz  but what do you expect for this price  it can even be overclocked to 85 hz   i have tested this  if you overclock your monitor you will not be able to use dsr to render into higher resolutions though  juuust fyi  oh  and the bezel is very thin and nice  the only thing is there is noticeable light coming through near the on off switch in a dark room  it s no big deal really  buy this monitor if you are looking to save a few bucks  it s a great value if you re looking to upgrade from 1080p but might not have 4k money  besides  you likely won t get the most out of 4k yet anyway  that s a whole different discussion  thanks for reading my review and happy shopping   ps  amazon  i m still mad at you for not price matching when the price went down 30 bucks the next day        
very nice monitor for the price
i bought this to replace an aging lcd monitor  man  is this new monitor bright  out of the box  the brightness is set to 100   i turned it down to 30   the colors are vibrant and crisp  and the contrast is very nice  i play a lot of pc games  and games look absolutely gorgeous  the backlighting of the monitor is a nice  even tone across the face of it  the menu controls are a little tough to figure out  it took me five minutes of playing with them to get it  i never read the manual   that shouldn t be too much of a problem  as you ll probably set it once or twice  and never touch it again  the power button is a round protruding piece of clear plastic hanging off the bottom right of the frame  and it glows blue when on  very easy to find in the dark  whether the monitor is on or off  the inputs are vga and dvi d  no hdmi   no speakers  either  which is great  monitor speakers are usually a wasted expense imo  standalone speakers are a much better value  the power cord has an external brick  that probably keeps the design of the monitor thin and light  and helps it stay cooler  my last monitor had the ac adapter internal  so it was able to use industry standard power cables  the type your pc probably has   this monitor has a specialty cable for power  in fact  there are four cables in the box  everything you need to connect it to the video output of your pc  the four cables are the power cord  the ac adapter  the dvi cable  and the vga cable  some manufacturers skimp by not giving you the cable you need to connect to your pc  so it s very nice that those cables are included in the box  my biggest complaint with the monitor is that the stand only lifts the screen 2 5  off of your desk  i will need to buy a monitor stand for it  or improvise something  more likely   the monitor does have the four standard screw holes on the back for mounting on an arm or on the wall  as of this writing  i ve only had it for a day  but it s a very impressive monitor so far 
awesome monitor  everything looks great
i absolutely love this monitor  connected effortlessly to my macbook air using a dvi to minidisplayport adapter  a lot of reviews say that the brightness was unbearably high out of the box  and required manual dimming  however  i noticed no such thing  the brightness was perfect right out of the box  and i usually prefer dimmer monitors   regarding tilting  i m absolutely baffled as to why many reviews here say that this monitor cannot tilt  or requires unscrewing and then rescrewing to manually tilt it  maybe i am misunderstanding what  tilt feature  means when it comes to monitors  in fact  i found it very easy to adjust the tilt of this monitor  even the instructions say that the monitor can be tilted up to 15 degrees   without having to unscrew the base  one small quibble i have about the assembly of this monitor is that connecting the base to the monitor itself required pushing together two pieces with an unexpectedly substantial amount of force  i m a 180 lb guy who lifts weights regularly  so i believe it should be a little fair to say that it shouldn t require that much force   at first  it seemed to me that the two pieces  the base and the slot on the back of the monitor  did not  snap  together  in fact  there was even a thread on the acer community site where someone had the exact same problem  google  acer g236hl base   and go to the thread  attaching g236hl monitor to base   and the responses in that thread were all completely useless  i eventually found that you simply have to push the base piece into the back of the monitor with a very strong push  and eventually it will very audibly and noticeably  snap  together  and it will then be locked together very securely  however  the force required to get the snap seems to be very large  and i can see someone who doesn t know this that will simply place the monitor on the base without snapping it together  which will lead to a very wobbly monitor  as the op of the thread mentioned above accurately complained 
i loved it so much that i bought another 
my wife recently got a job working from home as a call center customer service representative for a fortune 100 companies and one of the requirements was having dual monitors so that she could have multiple applications opened to comfortably service their customers  my wife was using her laptop and a monitor to meet the dual monitor requirements  which was ok  so i got her a second monitor  i mounted the monitors on a vivo dual monitor desktop stand  which works perfectly  the picture quality on the the monitors are awesome and it performed as advertised  i just wished it had a hdmi port or two to connect our apple tv 
i bought two of those and made an awesome 5120x1440 workstation
i bought two of those and made an awesome 5120x1440 workstation  it lets met view 5 microsoft office pages simultaneously and do other cool things  very bright and comfortable monitors 
great monitor for the price  would buy again   actually i might get a second one 
firstly  i am by no means an expert when it comes to displays  i did do quite a bit of research  and spent a long time trying to decide glossy matte  which screen size is best for me  resolution  etc  i got this monitor to use alongside my 2012 macbook pro  and it worked instantly with 0 set up   you do need a display     mini display cable though   i am extremely happy with it out of the box  and as soon as i plugged it in the words  f    yeah  just kinda slipped out  i originally wanted a glossy screen because i thought the matte ones are dull  but this monitor is anything but dull  the colors are great  and everything looks super crisp  i think 25  is a good size  and the high resolution makes great use of all the screen space without anything being too small   i sit about 2 3 feet away and admittedly don t have the best eyesight   the stand does tilt  though only a bit   not sure why there are so many people saying it doesn t  anyway all in all  fantastic monitor  especially for  250      i love the extremely thin bezel  and the beautiful picture quality  if you re considering it  go for it  i really don t think you ll regret it 
poor man s cadillac  affordable  colorful  sharp and clear 
i m sorry for talking about graphics cards in this review  this is because your satisfaction with this very nice monitor  goes hand in hand with what you are driving it with  no doubt  the highest resolution you use up to now  is 1920 x 1080  this referred to as hd  well  even though there are higher resolution monitors  well beyond the acer g257hu  this 2560 x 1440 resolution  is a satisfying full step above normal hd  1920 x 1080  looks lackluster in comparison  if you plan to use this monitor mainly for photo enhancement software  make sure your graphics card can support 2560 x 1440  heck  many modern cpu s  motherboard combos can facilitate that  amd a8  a10  and nearly all newer intel i5   up can  i used a amd hd 6850 and this category gpu would work fine for photo work  even some normal graphics intensive games  but  expect to use a decent graphics card  if you want to create videos  or play popular graphics intensive games  even though there are hi end graphics cards starting over  300  i use a mid priced nvidia 960 based card  this card melds well with photoshop and lightroom s new use of gpu power  amd does not use cuda  nvidia card do  and in abundance  photoshop products are made to recognize cuda  you can look up what this means in researching  the nvidia 960 along with this monitor  works great for most games that use 2560 x 1440 resolution  but in super hi end  reference benchmark games  it would be lacking in frame rate  unless you lowered greatly  the graphics parameters  it s not that it won t play these games  it s just that you wouldn t be able to  max  out   the graphics settings  some would have you believe that certain gpus will not work on  such n  such  game  when the truth is  it absolutely will  but it won t run the game in a usable way  unless you drastically tweak the graphics adjustment sliders way down  thus  in the end run  you will probably want to play the game in its full glory  so why waste your money  and end up upgrading to a faster card  some are looking for a 27   instead of a 25   as this acer is the latter  consider this  the 25  matrix is tighter 2560 x 1440  than a 27   so it is actually a tiny bit superior in the sharpness  besides  the 27  is a lot more expensive to purchase than the 25  at the time of this review  wait a two or three years  and a 30  2560  x 1440 may cost less than  200  or  get this now  lol 
work well for a triple monitor setup
use these monitors for triple display for gaming and cad work  no complaints so far with them  they have good quality picture  the speakers aren t that great but i usually have headphones on 
buy it now
wow  ok  i only got this 20 minutes ago but     i think i am in love  i am using an i5 4200u laptop  lenovo  with intel hd 4600 graphics and this was plug and play via hdmi at 2560x1440 at 59 or 60 hertz  not sure why the default was 59 but 60 was the other option  i didn t mess with it    it is a very noticeable change from my 1080p 23  screen  i had a great little tablet that was 2560x1440 on a 10  screen and i always hated how things looked so nice there but so blah on my main computer screen  well    no more  in lightroom  i m a photographer   the picture in the main view is huge now with all the extra screen real estate  both from the 25  versus 23  screen but also because the increased resolution allows for smaller side bars   huge and sharp  the speakers are a bit tinny and i will keep using my external speakers but     for  259 this this is amazing and a steal  don t be fooled by the low price  this thing is fantastic 
everything about this monitor is awesome
this is a brilliant all around monitor and great for gaming  the size of the monitor is good  and the colors and text are really clear  i had a really nice viewsonic monitor for years so i was already used to using a good monitor  in games you get the 1440 resolution  so your games look clearer than ever before along with the vibrant colors  at first i thought maybe the monitor was a little bright but your eyes adjust quickly and it is easier to read text than with other monitors  i had a little bit of a problem getting windows to recognize the maximum 2560x1440 resolution  it identifies it as a  generic pnp monitor   initially i tried to connect the monitor while windows was still running  which you really shouldn t do anyways  whenever you connect a new monitor  your system should be turned off and only after connecting and turning on the monitor should you turn your pc on  eventually i deleted the  generic pnp monitor  entry in device manager  and then shutdown the pc  i moved the dvi cable to a different port on my graphics card  and then started it back up and it recognized the correct maximum resolution for the monitor  but i think the solution was to delete the previous generic pnp monitor entry  you also need to use the cable provided with the monitor  or another dvi dual link cable because that is required for the higher resolution  another problem i have seen with windows not recognizing the higher resolution is by using a dvi to hdmi cable or other types of converter dongles  so you shouldn t use those either  the games are so clear that you don t really need antialiasing anymore  since you now run games at 2560x1440 with this monitor  and the higher resolution will bring your fps down a little  you can turn off the antialiasing if you need the extra fps 
great product for your budget consumer
i really enjoy this screen  the difference between my old 1080p screen was very noticeable  being stuck at 60 frames is not so bad since you would need two 1080 ti s to get more then that on certain titles at 4k  yeah ok 2k   overall great product  i did not notice any bleed on my screen  i would recommend this if you are looking to stay budget but want a little more then 1080p  i will likely get the acer predator later only and make this my second screen  for not it gets the job done and should be completely fine for most 
worth the price
this is a review for the g247hyu 1440p monitor  for the price you cant beat it from what ive seen  the monitor is actually a 24 physical monitor with 23 8 of screen space  pros   the actual physical monitor looks much more stylish than i anticipated  its pretty sleek looking   ips display for sharper colors and images than tn panels   if you have a nvidia gpu you can easily overclock this monitor to 76hz using the nvidia control panel  this is the max supported refresh rate according to the manual  im not going to experiment past this rate further  for gaming   16 fps is still a nice improvement if youre coming from a 60hz monitor like myself   if youre upgrading from 1080p you will certainly notice a difference  it may not immediately make your jaw drop  but once you start playing games or looking at photos youll notice new details and clarity that simply were not present in 1080p resolution   i do not regret the purchase one bit  acer has really proved to be a great value for the money company  i bought one of their laptops recently and was very impressed with it as well  cons  the monitor stand looks good  but the complaints about it not being as sturdy as it should are true  the screen can easily shake slightly from movement on your desk  its by far not a deal breaker though  seems easily fixed with a little brainstorming  something acer should address though 
affordable and future ready
this is a good deal for a monitor capable of 1440 resolution  it came with connector cables for all of the available input ports  dvi  hdmi  displayport   which was a wonderful surprise and big time saver  the screen frame is so thin it s virtually invisible and ideal for anyone using multiple monitor setups  the stand is fairly solid but the screen will bobble around a bit if your desk gets bumped a lot  this wasn t an issue for me  the 1440 native resolution does make everything smaller on the screen if you re coming from a 1080 resolution  that means text is smaller and a little harder to read  but it also opens up so much space to run multiple programs side by side or to give wider workspaces in programs like video editors  an acceptable trade off if you re not primarily working with text 
in a word  stunning
in a word  stunning  super bright screen  vivid colors  smooth movie watching  not a dead pixel to be seen  bought this flat screen during lunch time amazon surfing  the price i paid for this 27  screen made me think it was a misprint  a quick comparison of other web sites   nobody came close   10 00 next day shipping sealed the deal   i clicked the mouse  arrived next day   was hooked up within 5 10 minutes  as others have already said you need to back down the brightness from factory pre set level of 98 to whatever you find comfortable   56 works for me   the unit i received allows front back comfort tilting and the stand is plenty sturdy sitting on an adult s desk  really  once your viewing angle is adjusted   how often do you touch your monitor again   my monitor came with a vga and a dvi input   no hdmi jack  i m using my original belkin vga cable  haven t experienced any power supply high pitched whine as others complained about  mine came with a power brick  this is a computer monitor and not a flat screen tv so i wasn t expecting built in speakers  there aren t any   on a scale of zero to ten   this is a solid nine  any complaints are from folks wanting mercedes performance at chevy prices  i m a happy camper with this purchase  an easy recommend to others 
acer monitor review
i purchased this on sale for my home office  and i am very glad that i did  it included the correct cords to hook it up to my laptop  so now i have a 17  laptop screen and this 21 5  monitor working together  and i couldn t be more pleased  i finally have enough  space  to be working in several windows and documents all at the same time  prior to this i was constantly switching between windows  and it was very annoying  i like that i finally have the room to spread out  the monitor itself arrived nicely packaged  it is light and easy to adjust the viewing angle  i thought the screen was very bright    too bright for my eyes    even after i lowered the brightness all the way  so i am using an app to adjust the brightness and color tones and make it easier for me to view  i have also ordered a glare screen  i have very sensitive eyes so your experience may be entirely different  but if you also have sensitive eyes  this monitor may need a glare screen and or an app to adjust the brightness even further  on the whole i m very happy with the size and functionality of this monitor  it does everything i was hoping  and looks very attractive on my desk  i would buy it again and i highly recommend this as a great value 
great 23  widescreen monitor
i had been using my husbands desktop computer and have gotten used to using his with 2 monitors  well hubby didn t like me on it all the time when he was wanting to use it so he decided to buy me my own  i was so surprised when i saw the size of the monitor and knew that it was large enough to have 2 screens up at once  yes i am a multi tasker  this is a very slim monitor and the controls are on the bottom underside of the right side  the monitor s 23  and the colors are very life like  this is a high definition wide screen lcd tv  it is very easy to connect up to my computer with no disks to download first  it is very light weight at about 5 pounds  it comes with all the cords needed  i was a little sad at first because i did not think it tilted  but after reading all the comments i know know how to tilt it 
the most beautiful monitor for the price
this monitor is amazing  especially for the price  it looks absolutely beautiful and bezel free design is very sleek looking  i use it on the full 2560x1440 resolution all the time and it s a joy to look at  games look really amazing at full wqhd on this and i was able to drop the aa down to only 4x and it looked just as good as 1020p on 16x  the monitor stand seemed wobbly at first  but then i realized you need to actually flip it over  remove the screw  then put the monitor attachment into the stand  finally  you put the screw back in and crank it down  very very steady now  also  this monitor does tilt between  5 and  15 degrees  it was a little disconcerting at first because i could see the bezel bend  if you place your hand on the base and give the top a firm but slow shove it will start to tilt  it becomes easier to tilt it after this initial  breaking free  of the pivot 
1440p is the only way to go
this monitor still has me smiling over a week later  i keep on playing battlefield 1 and literally saying outloud  holy cow this is amazing   1440p just looks soooo good  i bought a nvidia 1070 along with this and i wish i bought it sooner  i only use my computer at home for playing video games such as battlefield 1  heroes of the storm  rocket league  wow  skyrim  etc  this monitor is honestly beautiful  the stand is pretty cheap and the monitor slightly wobbles if i m mashing my keyboard  but its not bad enough to take away a star  this monitor is just great  edit  fixed a typo 
awesome quality and price 
these are a perfect price point and look and work like a charm  i mounted them to an arm and have two for each desk  i bought four of them and it was a brilliant purchase  highly recommended 
nice monitor
i did a lot of searching before settling on this one  this monitor replaced a 20 inch 1600x900 display  i was torn between monitors with 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 resolutions because i wasn t sure if i needed more desktop space or slightly larger items on my screen  the latter seemed like a good compromise between 900 and 1440  this monitor is surprisingly light and way too bright out of the box  even at a setting of 50  i think i want to move it down more before it burns out my retina  this monitor will be used mainly for coding so i haven t calibrated it with my spyder yet but i ll assume it will reproduce colors just fine  one of the reviews mentioned something about the tilt being difficult so i skipped acer s default mounting option and mounted it to a neo flex lcd arm  my mac says it supports rotation so i rotated the monitor and changed my display settings and it worked  the only complaint i have is that after i purchased this item through tigerdirect s amazon store  it became available directly from amazon for forty dollars less a couple days later  such is life  i guess 
high quality 1440p ips screen  cheaper than most because it s not much else than that 
tl dr  it s a   230 screen  if you just need a 1440p  60hz  ips  screen  this is perfect and won t break the bank  this screen is a very good buy  it was about  235 new at the time of my purchase  yet this is a high quality screen  similar to other screens of much higher price  the screen has very good color reproduction  a fast response time  and nearly bezel less at the top and sides  when i first turned this screen on  it was blindingly bright  it was set to 80  brightness  so i turned it down and kept turning it down until it was a comfortable 15   it ll be good even in sunlight  25  is a good size and sets up a very comfortable pixels per inch  but you may want to scale up everything to 125  as that will make text very clear and legible  there essentially zero discoloration when viewing at wide angles  whether it be vertically or horizontally  one of my gripes is that there is slight backlight bleed on the furthest corners  from you  of completely black screens when you view it at an angle  i guess about 30 degrees  when viewing straight on  it is not visible  and the presence of any other colors in the scene other than true black will usually nullify this effect  i seem to have been blessed by the silicon lottery with no extraneous backlight bleed nor any dead pixels  hopefully  many other users will experience the same  overall  this is a wonderful monitor  however  it has no other bells and whistles  the reason this screen is relatively cheap for being 1440p could stem from the fact that it s hardly anything else  the speakers on this monitor are terrible  worse than my laptop s speakers  the stand is slightly wobbly but isn t a dealbreaker  only if you re nitpicky  in which case there are vesa adapters for this screen for about  35  and it doesn t have gaming oriented software in the osd  it s 60hz  which is good for casual use  watching shows  and productivity  but if you built a  2000 rig  i expect that you would get a fancier 144hz monitor with either freesync or gsync  i haven t overclocked this screen to 75hz  as i don t have the hardware to support the higher framerate  watching shows and videos in 1080p look good on this screen  scaling up to 1440p isn t bad at all  even though it s an odd multiplier  but scaling itself is a rather weird process  and you ll end up with approximations as you go up in resolution regardless of the multiplier  you get a tiny bit of smoothing from the scaling process  which isn t very bad unless it s critical you need to see every damn pixel  in which case most content still will have some sort of smoothing already in the content  if you really need 1080p at 1080p  have it bordered on all sides so it uses only a 1920x1080 pixels  the size of the screen is large enough for that  the back facing ports are a plus  and don t detract from the slim profile by much  the power supply is external  so if you lose it you can t just use one of those computer power cables  but it does help the overall size of the computer  oh  and it includes 1 hdmi cable  1 dvi d dual link cable  and 1 displayport cable  i already had hdmi  so no problem there  i believe this also has that content handshake thing  if you re concerned about that  it was shipped in a cardboard box filled with styrofoam
a 4 6 star review of a very good monitor at 1440p that is crisp  functional  and reliable  highly recommended 
best value 1440p monitor for the price you re going to get  on a limited budget  this 1440p 25  monitor does the job  the text and image quality is clear and crisp  no dead pixels  you will need to adjust the colors upon arrival to make sure the whites are balanced and tones are balanced  i ve been using this monitor for 2 years now and it s worked out just fine  my productivity has increased with the extra pixels and it s hard to go back to 1080p after this  the  black light bleed  is minimal and not really noticeable on my first unit  otherwise  the colors are amazing and beautiful  no vesa mount  i did buy one more later this year but the black light bleed was asymmetric on the lower right corner  when turning on this monitor  there is a 2 3 second delay as it tries to display the acer logo  but this is not a big deal for me  overall  i must recommend this monitor for those looking for more space and this price is hard to beat for what you re going to get 
pretty good 
excellent  no dead pixels  looks pretty good  my asus monitors all look a little better but this was a great buy   i got it on sale for  150 btw  update  just purchased a second one after 1 year and 3 months  so i can tell you after all this time it s still like the day i bought it  i actually pinned this page to my chrome explorer and checked the price every day for the last 8 months or so just patiently waiting for it to drop back to  150 again  because it s a  200 monitor and i got the first one for  150 so i refused to pay more than that for the second one  and today it finally dropped    so glad i held in there  it was  180 many times on sale but i patiently waited for another  150 sale and here it is  got two of these for  300 now  happy happy happy  they are both for my wife  i use the asus vx279q  three of them  for my own setup 
acer g247hyu is a good budget 1440p monitor
i picked up two acer g247hyu monitors for a dual monitor setup  so far  i ve only had the monitors for less than a month  but i ve found them to be an enjoyable upgrade over 1080p for more screen real estate  there are other 1440p monitors at slightly larger sizes  25    27    but the smaller size at this resolution makes the image more crisp and takes up less desk space if you run two or three monitors  the price is also significantly cheaper for those on a tight budget  the pixel density does make text smaller  but i found that it is completely usable when running the monitor at 100  scaling in windows  on a side note  this is good for programs that aren t yet optimized for high dpi displays and scaling  monitor construction    thin bezel   only 1 4  measured distance between the side edge and the nearest column of pixels  the near frame less construction makes it good for multi monitor setups    the simple snap on stand is quite cheap being made mostly out of black glossy plastic  and being only able to tilt forward backward  the x base is assembled to the column with a single screw  i won t complain that much about it   as it is a budget monitor  the stand actually does just fine with minimal wobble when placed on a sturdy table  if you need more features like height adjust or screen rotation  i d go with a different monitor    the entire back surface and trim of the monitor is black glossy plastic  yes  it attracts dust and fingerprints but luckily it s the part of the monitor you don t really look at  the monitor buttons are located on the bottom right hand side  so they are accessible even when you have the monitors side to side  panel quality    the ips panel usable even with some sunlight in the room because the screen is matte and fairly bright  i liked the vivid colors despite the monitors not being factory calibrated for color   there can be slight color differences between the monitors   so if you are looking for perfect color accuracy you would probably need a different professionally calibrated monitor    the monitor does have the ips glow associated with ips technology  the glow is most noticeable when viewed at an angle in a dark room with dark colors like black  if you view a black screen in a dark room head on  the effect will be seen on the corners  i personally don t mind the glow since it s not distracting for desktop work  but just keep that in mind that it s there  maybe a darker scene in a movie or during game play   while the panel is 60hz and not really intended for gaming  i don t see any major drawbacks to using it if you re a casual gamer since the response time is stated to be only 4ms    though this is down to luck  i may have been a bit more unlucky for the pixel lottery  for the two that i got  1st one has a minor green sub pixel on when the panel is displaying all black  but the sub pixel appears to be very dimly lit and unnoticeable when not explicitly looking for it  2nd one had a strange pixel defect where a green sub pixel was on when intending to display blue and the green sub pixel in the same pixel was black when intending to display green  it was actually rather distracting  so i had it replaced  having replaced the 2nd one  3rd monitor has two minor sub pixel defects like the 1st one  only when all black is displayed  and they simply remain very dimly lit as green and blue   again almost unnoticeable unless closely examining the panel from inches away  either way  i am okay with the minor defects  just not a hot dead pixel in a commonly viewed spot on a brand new monitor  so that s pretty much my personal experience on the pixel lottery  but i think the minor defects will probably go unnoticed for most buyers that don t explicitly go looking for them  just to make it clear   the minor pixel defects that i encountered are completely unnoticeable against a colored screen   can only be barely spotted with pixels set to black  basically those sub pixels still power up as they should although very dimly stuck when not powered  connectivity ports    there are three ports   hdmi  displayport  and dvi d and each monitor came with a displayport  hdmi  and dual link dvi d cable  basically you re completely covered on needing to buy cables for all of the provided ports to get started which is a pleasant surprise    there is also an included male male 3 5mm audio cable for the built in speakers when not using a digital signal  they aren t good speakers as they are small   i would say equivalent to some laptops  but if you absolutely have nothing else to use  they are functional  i would definitely recommend to use an external speaker system    the power supply is a separate power brick that plugs into the monitor  i think this is actually a better choice than an integrated power supply since if it goes dead  you can probably just replace the brick  overall  it s a great budget monitor if you re looking in a simple 1440p display for the home office and not quite ready to move to 4k 
an excellent monitor for the price
ok  i ll be honest  i really  really wanted to get an asus mx27aq  however  it was not in stock for a long time  and i ordered this instead  while thinking that i d really like the extra 2 diagonal inches  i am not sure how much of a real world difference it would make  109 vs 117 ppi   while some may pick apart this monitor  no vesa mount  etc   it was clearly stated up front what it did or didn t have  in my opinion  this monitor is an absolutely amazing bang for the buck  the extra resolution was exactly what i ve been looking for a couple years  i had a 1600x1200 dell ultrasharp  and the image on this beats it  additionally  i really did not want to revert from 1200 to 1080 vertical pixels  and this resolution is just want i wanted  can be driven with a decent video card  i got a 750ti  without any trouble  oh  and there is no way in my mind that i can justify the far more expensive asus over this monitor  great picture quality  ok basic speakers  tinny but usable  no way i d take a star off for built in speaker quality  and passable for what we need  and attractive design  if you got the mx27aq over this  love it  and feel the price difference is worth it  please don t burst my bubble by telling me    
beautiful image quality with zero ips bleed  amazing quality given the price 
i love this monitor  i actually bought two of them  however i returned them to amazon and replaced them with a single 27 inch ips panel gaming monitor  viewsonic   the color vibrancy on these acer 24  monitors are incredible given the  200 price  the huge 2560 x 1440p resolution gives unparalleled image quality to 1080p resolution monitors of any size  there is no competition  a 2560 x 1440p ips monitor has better image and color quality than any 1920 x 1080p monitor  including my 70  vizio led tv  there is no backlight  ips  bleed on the monitors i received  they may  however  require slight image calibration to obtain the best possible image quality  when i had these monitors  i set them to 100  brightness and 80  contrast  let me put it to you this way  i will never own another tn monitor ever again  ips and va panels are the future of ultra clear display quality for monitors  the premium price you pay for ips or va monitors is worth every penny  especially if you use it for gaming  video editing  or picture production   editing  pros  1  amazing image quality from the ips panel and relatively small 24  display with a 2560 x 1440p resolution  all of this at just over  200  2  no ips bleed on any corner of the panel  3  unnoticeable input lag  solid 4ms response time at 60hz refresh rate  this is the budget monitor you gamers will want to use for a multi display setup  4  very thin monitor bezel with only 1 4 in  bezel width on each side  perfect for dual or triple monitor setups  5  2560 x 1440p resolution 6  has two  2  decent quality built in speakers 7  100 000 000 1 contrast ratio  supposedly this represents the difference between the  whitest  whites  and the  darkest  blacks from my perspective  pure white backgrounds look pretty damn white  while gaming  the colors are absolutely breathtaking  the overall color appearance while gaming is just right  i didn t notice any color that had a  too much  or  too little  aspect to it  cons  1  cheap plastic monitor stand that is somewhat flimsy 2  doesn t have a vga port  only hdmi and display port  3  no vesa mount     this was the deal killer for me  there is a vesa mount for sale that s made by a third part on amazon for this specific monitor  it costs about  30 for each mount  4  not 27  5  no height adjustment  only tilt adjustment      acer  if your reading this  please start making all of your monitors with vesa mounts or add the adapters        overall  this is an excellent budget ips monitor for gaming and everyday general tasks  if you plan on wall mounting these monitors  know that there are vesa mounts available for them  they are very new  however  and have no reviews as of typing this review  make sure the vesa mount  adapter  will indeed work with these monitors 
bought 2 monitors  got an old march 2015 and new sept 2016 model instead of the same models
bought 2 of these 2 weeks apart  first one arrived  came with power and vga cable  very light compared to the 22  dell monitor it was replacing  has hdmi  vga  and dvi ports on the back  no usb or speakers  makes the monitor very light to move around  does not have a height adjustment but does tilt slightly  was happy enough with the first one that i bought another to use side by side  however the 2nd one i received did not look the same  it s the same model and has the same functions but the bezel on the edges are smaller  the buttons underneath are smaller and easier to press  and the back is a glossy plastic instead of matte  problem i had with the first one was the buttons underneath were a little big and did not match up with the menu on the screen so making changes is a little painful as i keep hitting the wrong buttons  don t have this issue with the newer model  everything lines up perfectly  i m just gonna keep both for now but i am a little ocd and the difference in the edges does bother me a little so i ll see if it s gonna bother me enough in the next two weeks to return it  the first one had the power led light underneath and the 2nd one had the power led light on the front 
acer s budget monitor is quite the looker 
acer continues to deliver quality products at an affordable price  i needed a new pc monitor recently as my old dinosaur monitor finally died out the other day  i researched potential new monitors based on my price budget  and i decided to purchase this acer 21 5 inch led monitor via my prime membership  the monitor arrived at my doorstep two days after purchasing it  and i immediately hooked it up to my pc via the included dvi cable   the monitor also includes a vga cable as well   i was instantly blown away at the crystal clarity of the display of this acer monitor  and the size of the widescreen does not disappoint either  i must say overall i am quite pleased with my purchase of this product and i fully recommend this monitor for anyone looking for a fantastic deal coming in under a  100 
the 24 inch and 27 inch sizes are perfect for most desktops
this is the first 1080p monitor that i ve ever owned  and i ve had it for about 10 months now  when i first received it  i was immediately impressed with the amount of screen space that was available  reading websites and editing documents became much easier  as there was more space for information  and games became much more enjoyable to play  the 24 inch and 27 inch sizes are perfect for most desktops  the colors on this monitor are brilliant  everything is clearly defined with a sharp  crisp quality that isn t found in most other monitors  the screen is also capable of becoming very bright  which greatly contributes to the quality of the colors  the matte display contributes to this as well  there were no dead pixels whatsoever  and there are still none after 10 months  if you want to use multiple quantities of this monitor for gaming  the left and right borders are very slim  it would work very well with bezel graphics  however  if you buy a vesa mount and rotate it 90 degrees  the bottom portion that reads  acer  will not allow you to use bezel  as it is slightly curved downwards  but i doubt anyone would want to do that anyway  it was easy to setup the monitor as well  simply remove everything from the boxes  but the base into the monitor  and screw it in  the screw is designed to never fall out  so it will already be attached to the monitor itself  just be careful while holding the monitor if it is not yet in the base  overall  i would definitely recommend this monitor to anyone who is interested in buying a bright  vibrant hi def monitor 
no frills  great image quality 
color is great  set up is easy  size is awesome  for my needs  the only downside  that i did not realize before purchasing  is that the tilt is not adjustable and the monitor rests on its stand at a fixed angle  could not deduct a star for that  as that is my personal preference and something i could have discovered before purchasing  that being said  i am pleased that the angle does not hinder how the picture looks like some other monitors i have used that distort or look less clear based on their angle  no frills here  but for the price  i would definitely recommend it 
five stars

great inexpensive monitor
these screens work great for inexpensive workstations  i have two set up in connection with my office laptop docking station  and another at home connected to my personal pc  the image quality is satisfactory  especially given the price  no  you wont be thrilled if you are expecting 4k hd images  but it works great otherwise  even while playing graphics demanding games  my only issue with this monitor is the connections  it has a dvi and vga connection  however lacks an hdmi  which seems to be the most common connection type  i wish they included an hdmi port  but the product description is clear that it doesnt  so i cant really knock it on that basis 
nice upgrade
i was going to buy two of these to use as a dual monitor setup  but found that one is enough  plenty wide enough  and even using vga it looks great  i was a bit hamstrung because as a video editor i had become accustomed to two monitors for increased desktop space  and my new computer has only vga and hdmi output on the integrated video card  i decided to start with one of these acer monitors and test if it looked similar enough using the dvi with an hdmi adapter  and the vga  i would buy another if the test was successful  maybe it s because i was using two crts before  but after plugging in with just the vga i was so happy i decided not to bother with a second monitor  just a caveat here    i don t do any gaming or real entertainment with my computer monitor  i just do schoolwork  spreadsheets  and an occasional show on netflix  this monitor works great for all of those  no more scrolling in my spreadsheets to see all the data  i ll also add the value is good  i was prepared to spend hundreds of dollars to get the setup i wanted  it was a nice surprise to solve my monitor upgrade for under  200 
a year later and still running like new 
i bought this monitor in early 2015 and i m actually back to buy another for a dual monitor setup which brings me to this review i forgot to leave earlier  this monitor is great for my general purpose home office usage  while i am a console gamer i cannot speak on it s pc gaming abilities  i really like the matte finish on this screen  my home office is pretty bright midday and even with a window right behind me i don t get any nasty glare  i m sure this matte takes away from a little color reproduction but that is not as important for my use  if i want a great blow the socks off color reproduction and quality i ll use my living room tv     some thing that could be better is the tilt of the screen  in that i mean the screen tilts but only a small amount what you see in the item picture is about max  and i wish it would go farther for situations where i might be standing up looking at the screen  then again i m also tall so this is pretty minimal  also  the construction is a little on the cheap side but its not like its falling apart on the desk  however  if your monitor will be getting handled by children or potentially taking trauma more than others  you might want to look for another  when i handle the monitor the stand feels like it could eventually break if it was stressed much  in the end i would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a general purpose home office 22  1080p display that will not be mounted to a monitor arm or put in harms way  the price is excellent for the product and no complaints here after a year of use
