piece of junk
the volume control does not work  also  no sound comes out of the right earpiece  this item comes without instructions  there is supposed to be a volume control  the only thing i see that looks anything like a volume control is two buttons  one of which has a plus sign and the other a minus sign  i would think that the plus sign means increase the volume and the minus sign means decrease the volume  neither of these buttons has any effect on the volume  there is sound coming out of the left earpiece but not the right earpiece 
would not recommend  will not buy again
very brittle  i knew it would break very soon  and it broke with some moderate pressure on the 3rd day  very cheap plastic  the designers of these headphones knew this  would not recommend  will not buy again  the good is that they look good and the cord is of good quality   but it it breaks what good is it    
would have been great if they hadn t broken so quickly 
i bought these based on the good reviews  they seemed great  really comfortable  but one of the ear pads broke off within a week  i don t expect  15 headphones to last forever  but a week  come on 
broke after 9 days   
these headphones arrived april 19  it is now april 28   the plug broke off inside the tablet  lasted only 9 days     cant get the plug part out of the tablet  not happy
