video review  awesome bang for your buck  folds up compact  decent quality  and they look awesome 
video review  yes  they work with glasses  decent bang for your buck  if you listen closely there s a bit of  fuzz  noise  but that is drowned out once the music video starts playing  these are the best headphones i ve tested  and i ve tested a lot  when it comes to latency  that is there s no delay when viewing a video on my iphone and the audio that s playing  note  there s quite a delay when pressing siri  like a good 3 4 seconds before she s  activated  
wear them daily
pros  comfortable on my large head  no headphone has ever covered my ears without hard places or sweaty or too tight  these are good for hours 2  battery seems to last many hours  lost track 3  pairs easily with my moto g 4 phone and also a bt transmitter connected to my chrome tv dongle  easily xfer back and forth 4  clean  rich sound  nice break from my ear buds  5  build quality acceptable for this price  soft earpads and padded cross support  buttons gave solid response  ear cups are flat enough to lay head on pillow to watch tv  6  adjustable enough to find perfect comfort position  7  good volume and surround and noise rejection cons  none  we ll see how they hold up to long daily use update 9 30 2017 i wear these for several hours each day  holding up well  battery still holds good long charge  i added moleskin to the earpads to make them a little more comfortable  ear holes could be a tad bigger for my head and ears  overall still the best headphones i have owned 
great purchase
fantastic head phones  they stay charged forever  i had them fully charged and used them for an hour on average 6 times a week and did not need to charge them again for a month  the only complaints i have is when doing certain exercises they tend to slide off my head a little so i have to adjust them a few times 
mic doesn t work
the mic doesn t work properly  others can barely hear my voice  update 04 06 2017  customer service did pretty good job and fast  by contacting me about the issue i had  they even re order a new one for me  now everything is work perfect as i expected  thank you and keep up the good work 
great headphones for the price
my wife took over my  300 head phones so i needed to find something that was ok and won t break the bank  these headphones sound just as good as my  300 set for the most part  they aren t as strong in the bass but they still hold their own as far as i m concerned  they are very comfortable over my ears and are easly adjustable also the battery seems to last long enough for me before i need to recharge  they are not noise canceling but do block out enough outside sound that i can forget the world around me and enjoy my music  now the only problem i have is she want s these and says i can have my old headphones back    go figure   
very nice value for bluetooth headphones  foldable   wired and wireless   good build quality 
need a nice value bluetooth headphones with durability  good sound quality    can be wireless or wired  this mpow headphone is it   unit operational test  this is a pretty simple unit to test  i started with testing fitment   adjustment to my head using the sliders  stainless steel sliders  nicely done   while also testing the ability for folding the headphones  worked great  very solid feeling   the memory foam ear cushions and along the inside of the headphone band where the top of your head will touch feel very comfortable with good spring in the foam  it is an attractive set of headphones  good use of contrast red  silver  and black  the device is touted to not be active noise canceling so we ll test passive noise reduction with the over the ears cushions  the device has user controls on one side  power  volume up  volume down  track forward  track reverse  play   pause  on the right ear side  my test  1  turn on the headphones     you ll heard a clear voice  power on  message  2  turn on bluetooth on your phone and pair the mpow headphones   connect  3  start up your preferred music or audio smartphone app  4  operate the headphones  connected and streaming from your bt enabled phone  for 10 hours continuous streaming and wired mode  using the supplied 3 5mm audio cable  along with conducting a test phone call  then power off the headphones  i used my primary phone  a new nexus 6p as my initial test  i turned on the headphones  the headphones provide an initial  powering on  along withe a  not paired  audio cue   then paired the device and connected by phone using bluetooth  yet another audio cue  phone 1 connected    i next started up one of the music apps  eureka  it works   sound quality is quite good especially at this price  little emphasis in the mid band imo   i can confirm no active noise cancellation but with the nature of the ear cushions i did experience reduce ambient noise when the headphones were on and in use  sound can get loud but yet clear  no distortion nor crackling   which is nice to see  you won t get thumping base or highs  but that s to be expected  i next disconnected from bluetooth and attempted to test wired connection using the supplied 3 5mm audio cable that was supplied by mpow to connect to my phone s headphone jack  the mpow worked well in wired mode  very handle to have both wired and wireless modes  i lastly powered off the headphones  nice touch for an audio  powered off  confirmation cue   my next test was to make 2 phone calls  one to my home landline phone and one to my cellular voicemail   calls were very clear and quite loud  with the headphone volume turned all the way up   and everyone could hear me fine using the built in mic  this test completed successfully as well   recharging  the mpow bluetooth headphones offers built in rechargable battery  420 mah  that is rated to last up to 13 hours of continuous music time or 15 hours of talking time  i ve done a test with the headphones running while streaming music using bluetooth  my test ended after 10 hours and it was still running  that s more than enough run time for me  i tested recharging as well using the micro usb port  found on the same side as the user controls   you ll see a red led light come on   it took me several hours for a full recharge after using for 10 hours straight in my music playback test   build quality  very solidly built device  not in the same league materials wise as bose but also not in the same price range  good use of sturdy plastics  memory foam as the ear cushion  stainless steel for the adjustable sliders  the unit s folding capability also worked well  very solid feeling along the hinges  good fit and finish overall   conclusion  this mpow bluetooth headphones over ear delivers in what they said this device could do  it connects seamlessly to your bt enabled phone and can play streamed audio but also can accept a wired connection  no battery charge needed in wired mode    the headphone design is foldable  great for travel   storage in general   it s a solidly built and comfortable to wear device  mpow offers a 45 day money back guarantee and a 18 month worry free guarantee as well  i ve not yet needed to take advantage on the other mpow items i ve bought in the past  all are working great   i would happily recommend these headphones to friends and family  especially for the value   flexibility to use in wireless or wired mode  mpow bluetooth headphones over ear  hi fi stereo wireless headset  foldable  soft memory protein earmuffs  w  built in mic and wired mode for pc  cell phones  tv
 30 is cheap for five stars  glory hands 
i waited over a month to write this review because i thought no way could these headphones actually be this good for the price  but i use them all day everyday and i have never been more impressed with headphones under   50    i have sensitive ears with headphones and am super picky but these are so comfortable i can sleep in them  noise reduction is great when something is playing  pretty crummy though when there s no audio  fast charge  easy to pair bluetooth or wire jack  play pause and fwd rwd buttons are handy  overall definitely worth the buy  highly recommend 
mom and teen approved  
birthday gift for our 19 year old son who keeps either breaking the headphones or they crap out on him after a few months  he loves the bluetooth and that they are over the ear     as do i  they fold up as well  although he hardly ever takes the time to do so during the few hours that he actually doesn t have them on  one of the main reasons i purchased this kind had to do with wanting him not to have them shoved inside his ears for these long periods of time  so   win win here  they seem to be holding up to him so far which says a lot actually lol  thank you  
truckers choice for talk and media
truck driver  i bought these to be able listen to audio books etc  while driving my big rig  love being able to answer phone at the touch of a button  pleasant female voice says  you have an incoming call  while media is on  noice cancellation is great  everyone hears me well through the invisible mike  comfortable  well constructed  loud  and has a cord jack so my wife can quickly use them on her iphone when she rides along without pairing to blue tooth  excellent product 
extreamly happy with my bluetooth headset 
this is my second pair of over the ear bluetooth headsets  i was looking for a comfortable fit with decent sound  soft padding for ears and padding for top of the head comfort  my last over the ear headset would get uncomfortable after about 30 min these met every aspect i was looking for  the sound quality for over the ear bluetooth headphones really are above average for this price range in my opinion  battery longetivity is superb for the amount of sound streaming for both speakers  bluetooth paring has been one of the best of any bluetooth  device i ve ever had the pleasure of oning  it can be paired with multible devices simultaneously  i have it paired with my 2011 imac    also my ipad air 2  and iphone 7 plus  with no connectivity issues  can be hard wired to any device with cable provided  if battery power is lost  control sound  pause or track both play  and reverse from the right side of the headset  i have nt had the opportunity to use the microphone for phone conversations  i purchased them for music  nice feature in the future if i use it i will update my review  i don t dote on sound  as long as it s streaming clear sounding music i m content   the mpow bluetooth met every expectation i was looking for and more  extremely happy with my purchase 
love them so far
i ve only had these for an afternoon but i already love them  i have a large head and certain headphones pressing into my ears or scalp cause migraines  so far  these have felt very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent  i was able to easily pair them with my nexus 5  i m still figuring out how to pair them with my asus chromebook  they are circumaural  cover the ear completely  and build quality seems good for the price  i bought these to replace a pair of wireless sennheiser rd160s that stopped working  i will update this review if these give me trouble after i get more use out of them but i am already impressed with them  given the price 
replacement works great
i received the item in a timely fashion  i unpacked it and read the user manual  then i charged it  the red light came on and in a couple of minutes it went out  i thought maybe it had been charged and was still holding the charge  i was able to pair it with my ipad  i listened to two tunes and then a full half hour of a britcom on youtube  then the battery was done  i recharged it and had a similar experience  i just returned it for a refund  be advised that you may or may not get one that works  the company contacted me and said they would like to send me a replacement  i received the replacement and charged it  it took about 3 5 to 4 hours to charge  i then paired it with my ipad  i listened to some of my music about two cds worth  i then watched about three of my favorite britcoms on you tube  the audio quality was outstanding  i listened to music or watched you tube tv shows and some music tutorials for the next week and a half  i even had them on for 7 5 hours one day  i planned to wait until they needed charging before i wrote the review  they are still going strong  the fit is good and very comfortable  now about the sound  i already said that it was outstanding  i compared them to my sennheiser cable head set  i honestly could not tell the difference  i then compared them to bose wireless there was a very slight difference but not much  overall they are extremely good  if you have trouble with them contact the company and see what they can do  i love them and could not be happier ron
best headphones
these headphones are perfect 
customer service superb    
broke after just four months poor mechanical design    okay they sent me a replacement free of charge    i have no other recourse but to give them 5 stars for customer service    it may have been just a fluke that they broke the first time    thank you mpow buy the way the sound quality is real good   
husband loves them 
i was very very excited to get these based off the reviews i read here  and though the sound quality is great  it hurts my head when i have them on even for 15 minutes  it feels like it s clamping on the sides of my head  ouch   other than that  i think they sound great   update   1 11 18  patazon contacted me after i complained about the mpow 059 s hurting my jaw head  and they were amazing  they apologized and offered me the newer version of these headphones  mpow h1   https   www amazon com dp b076hpb1hq  which are supposed to provide more comfort for longer use  i just received those today  and have been using them on and off for hours  no complaints whatsoever    i love them  they sound just as great as the 059 s and i feel zero discomfort  they re very soft against the ears and sound amazing  the song i like to use to test out headphone quality is believer by imagine dragons  d i didn t want the other pair to go to waste so my husband decided to use them  and he says he feels zero pain with them  so perhaps my head is too small    we are both very please with our new headphones  and i am even more impressed with the customer service from patozon 
i have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while
i have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while  and decided on these  i looked at bose soundlink ii  beats studio wireless  skullcandy crusher wireless  sony xtra bass wireless  and more  i finally decided to get these  after realizing that  200  was just too much for headphones  i have yet to be disappointed  these headphones are  most noticeably  built surprisingly well  they are a glossy black with red trim  and the red is a soft rubbery feeling  the sliding mechanism is stainless steel  and the folding has a tactile  click  into place when opened  the audio is good  it s not mind blowing  nor is the bass  but it s fairly well rounded and a solid performance  especially for anything in this price range  for the price  they re amazing  i ve used the mic for only one phone call  the other caller was unaware but did not complain and i never had to repeat myself  so i guess it works well enough though that s not why i bought them  the headphones pair easily enough with two devices  and can play from either one at a time  powering off if slightly awkward  as it tries to go into pairing before finally shutting off  holding the power call pause play button   these headphones come with an aux cable to connect them to a standard headphone jack  which was an absolute requirement for me  as i don t want to be reliant on a battery all of the time  they seem to sound slightly better when connected with the backup audio cable  but that might just be my prejudice  the wireless function  if already turned on  will silently deactivate power off when the aux cable is connected saving the battery  however  because of that  you lose audio talk controls when using the aux cable  not a big deal  most wired headphones don t control the music  battery life is rated at 12 hours  but i cannot accurately judge that as i usually use them wired  projected battery life based on what i ve used would seem that a 12 hour rating is probably pretty accurate  i havent drained them down past 80  according to my iphone s battery display  yes when paired with iphone it will give the headset s battery level  overall  i am ecstatic with these headphones  they even come with a nice velvety drawstring bag to pack them in when not in use  good sound  good comfort  good battery life  good features  great price 
a friend of mine recommended the ear bud type headphones of this brand
these are the most badass pair of headphones  a friend of mine recommended the ear bud type headphones of this brand  but ear buds tend to fall out of my tiny ears  these had solid reviews and thankfully came in a color other than red black  so i snatched them up  awesome purchase  sound quality is awesome  they fit over my ear  so they effectively cancel out noise unless someone were to come right up to me and speak  i don t think i could hear them if i had music playing  they also came with an aux cord and charging cable but no wall plug  fyi and they came with a pretty sweet gray suede    carrying case  no complaints whatsoever  however  i should mention that i haven t had them long enough to test out the battery seeing as i only got them yesterday and would never want to wear them for 12  hours 
awesome sauce
i m not a techy or a gamer  so this is just your average person s review  i love these because they are completely around the ear  your ear ends up in a little soft house   they are comfortable for my bigger than average head  i can wear them with my large plastic framed glasses without issue  the controls on the side are great  they are mic wireless and speaker wireless  they are easy to set up with both pcs and macs  i am using them across several devices at home and at work   they are rechargeable  no more need for constantly consumed batteries   and there is not any sound leakage  for the money  these headphones are awesome  i m seriously glad that i purchased them 
very impressed
this is my first experience with bluetooth wireless headphones and i am impress  i have nightmares about getting my old bluetooth cell phone to pair with the audio in my 07 camry  but these paired up to my iphone 7  immediately  i also purchased the daykit mini usb bluetooth csr 4 0 dual mode  a steal at under 7 bucks  and the mpow headphones paired up with my pc instantly  the sound quality is decent although it won t blow you away with extremes of volume or bass  for average listening though  they are more than adequate and they are wicked comfortable to wear  take them off every hour or so  so your ears can breathe though    the only issue i ve had  and it s not the fault of the mpow people is that when i run itunes on my win10 pc it gets way confused and i have to turn bluetooth off  exit itunes  then turn bluetooth back on and restart itunes  since i have other networked devices in the house  itunes sees them on the network  but it doesn t show them as an option  i have to select the  my computer  to get it to work  a minor inconvenience  but i blame apple  bottom line  if you want a very decent pair of really inexpensive  but quality made bluetooth headphones  give these a try 

i have used this headphone for awhile now and i really love it  it fits around my ears and glasses  maybe not completely perfect but the sound is amazing  i compared it to my older skull candy headphones and these ones are definitely better  i enjoy wearing these while chilling at home or talking a walk  like all headphones you ll have to take them off after long uses because it may hurt the top of your head ears  but i usually wear these for longer and i ve been fine 
i love these headphones not only is the price right but    
i love these headphones not only is the price right but the quality is amazing  i love the way these sound while i play my music how you came adjust the volume without touching your phone or tablet  i have been using these every chance i get and they go everywhere with me  my family tried them and they said it sounds the same as their beats headphones and i agree  i would recommend these to anyone who wants a great wireless headphones but not have to pay a lot for a pair  only wish they came with a hard case instead of a bagged one but that wasn t a big deal i just bought that along with these and of course got the protection plan cause you never know what may happen down the line   total for all that was 55   rounded to the nearest dollar  so if you want some that look cool and sound great get these 
exceeded expectations in every way  well done 
for the money    and even for more money    these over the ear headphones are spectacular  i am picky  but these are spectacular  why  1  they look more expensive than they are  they are sturdy  stylish  2  they are very comfortable  i have a big head  these fit just fine  and are very comfortable  these are perhaps the most comfortable headphones i have ever owned  and i have owned dozens of them over the years  they do not grip your head too tight  nor are they too loose  the padding on the earpeices is soft and plush  but not overdone or mushy  these are great to wear  3  they sound really good  many bluetooth headsets and earphone and heaphones at this price point have a whine or hum or static when no music is playing  these do not    they are absolutely silent  the bass is deep and good  they are pretty clear sounding  not muddy  very very good sound  you can pick out all of the crummy audio on youtube  as compared to the cleaner audio from a service like spotify or itunes oor amazon music  which means that these can reproduce sound well enough for you to tell the difference  i d say that the headphones have a pretty neutral sound  with plenty of bass which does not overwhelm and is not too boomy  considering the price range  you are never going to get  best ever  tight and accurate bass from bluetooth headphones in this price range  but the bass does not offend  and as i said  i am rather picky  but i can apply a sliding scale based on price  there are plenty of over bassed  boomy headphones  and plenty of people who think that sounds good  ugh  with regular music  let s face it  you have bluetooth compression  so it isn t ever going to be audiophile quality over bluetooth  but at home or going for a walk  i love these things  they are so nice  i do not want to work out in them and ruin them or sweat them up  but i ll bet theyy d be good for working out if you do not mind grody headphones  lol  they do not feature active noise cancelling  but the ear cups block out most ambient noise  unless you are paying giant dollars  active noise cancellation merely kills battery life  adds noise and lower resolution sound  not necessary  a doodad most do not need  and i do not miss it on these headphones  4  mechanics  they connected via bluetooth very easily  when you power them on  they connect relatively quickly  walking all around my entire 1200 sqft condo  i never lost the signal  even though the phone was on one side of the condo and i was on the other  they charge via the ubiquitous micro usb found on android phones  though there is a warning not to charge these on anything more than a 5w adapter  the controls are sparse and subtle    they are not visually obvious so as to ruin the aesthetics of the headphones    but the controls are easy to find and use  one power pairing play pause button in the middle  up and down volume and forward and back buttons  they work great  the charging port is subtly located  adding to the style and class of these very well though out headphones  5  durability longevity  hey i just bought them  they seem to be of high quality but time will tell  i have 2 other mpow products and have owned them for more than a year and they both still work fine  so mpow seems to have their qc under control  you see things like this at this price point and you think  are they worth it   and  will it sound like garbage   herere to tell you  these are worth it  they sound great  and they are a very worthwhile purchase 
excellent headphones for low cost bluetooth solution 
i ve probably owned 25 different kinds of headphones over the years    from cheap  cheap to multiple hundred dollars in cost  expensive ones have broken  cheap ones have held up for a while  but i still ended up needing a pair of inexpensive  bluetooth headphones to use when watching tv or listening to music while going to sleep  these were cheap  about  35  but had good reviews so i decided to try them  what a surprise  decent sound quality  i m older and my hearing isn t what it used to be  but they have reasonably solid bass and the frequency response seems smooth to me   the sound quality isn t what you ll get from really high grade headphones but the build quality is good and it is  after all  being used with an iphone playing mp3s  and it is quite an upgrade from using earbuds  i m pretty sure i could not have gotten a better value for the money  they are solid and although i ve only had for a couple months  i think they re going to hold up well over time  pairing is easy and they don t seem to require recharging too frequently  anyone who has  40 or  50 expectations should be very pleasantly surprised with both the sound and the build quality on these 
sound is very clear  a good stylish product  amazingly durable material
i m a video blogger  and it s important for me to have a good stylish product  these headphones are just a bomb  my favorite red sound is very clear amazingly durable material
these headphones are perfect  it works amazingly well with my glasses and    
these headphones are perfect  it works amazingly well with my glasses and plugs  stretched ear lobes   it does a great job helping me block out all the other people around me when i am at a coffee shop 
best bang for the buck   get bangin     
not going to lie    i only bought these to hold me off till corsair makes a better version of the void with true surround sound but it turns out these headphones are freaking amazing   the price  style  colors and comfort are all a grand slam  the battery on this thing is fantastic and it baby sips on the juice  if i had to be critical of these and i don t want to be but i d have to say the fact the headphones don t twist forwards like all the rest of the traditional headphones  these do fold into a more smaller and portable size which is great but i don t know    i m really stretching here guys  very happy with my purchase  thank you mpow  i ll gladly buy another pair from you guys  update  i realized there is no pictures in the reviews for the blue headphones  maybe these might help    i guess 
very nice headphones 
these headphones are quite nice  they fit well and operate as stated  i purchased them to operate with my 55 series samsung tv  the 55 series will not sync directly to the headphones  the 64 series will  so i purchased a bluetooth adaptor which synced with the headphones easily  these headphones support two bluetooth devices allowing me to sync my iphone as a secondary device  i couldn t be happier with the outcome and yes  i would recommend to friends and family 
awesome headphones for under  40  highly recommend  good sound  good quality  superb value 
update  9 months in  i live in these   radheadphones      these are awesome for  35  they sound ok  they initially sounded a little flat  but i don t really care about sound quality  these have nice 40mm drivers  they sound decent  people can hear me good when i m on the phone  with no wind   they work very well on my phone  and on my laptop i have a top  find your bluetooth driver on your computer  go to power management  and disable to setting  allow windows to turn off the device to save power   these headphones connect to my computer almost immediatly after power on  same with the phone  they are comfy  keep my ears warm in seattle  they look nice  i highly highly recommend them over a  300 pair of beats  buy these for your friends 
like champ  100
i order this head phone for my video editing and they work real good  noise cancellation is real good  sound is real good via bluetooth  it has a strong bass  the design is solid and strong  battery is real good too  highly recommend mpow  also i have the cheetah sport and they work like champ  very comfortable also plus the company will work with you if you have any problems  satisfaction  100 
very nice  comfortable  and good sound 
pros  i love the fact that it s bluetooth and wired so you can use it with older systems too  battery lasts a solid 8 hours at work with continuous play  over the ear fits nicely and is very comfortable  the headband isn t snug or too tight like many are  sound is very good over bluetooth from my phone  you can control the volume and answer calls via the buttons built into the headphones  cons  i had a bit of a hard time getting the bluetooth to connect but once paired they work very well  there is no tactile feature on the buttons so it s hard to feel if you are on the volume button or the on off button  it would be nice to have the buttons contoured in some manner to allow you to control without having to look  as a 20 year member of amazon i rely on independent reviews when shopping and i will always try to be as honest and impartial as i can and will try to provide helpful insight into the product  i am reviewing this product as it relates to how it works for me in my intended use  i tend to review products that i really like  or that let me down in some manner  if you found this review helpful  then please click the  helpful  link below  thank you  and happy shopping 
beautiful design  flawless operation
in this day and time  it is refreshing to encounter a product that is not all cast plastic  the construction of this headset is truly a work of art   not obvious in the listing photos is the stainless steel inner headband  and the whole thing is put together with metal clasps and lovely machined screws  at least 12 visible   so  it is really a sensual joy to pick this up and place it on your head  the construction almost feels like a finely jeweled watch   so surprising for a  30 product  the ear cups seem to be very solidly attached to the band  yet in a way that they articulate to conform to your head   and the ear pads just look like they are going to hold up for a decent time period  granted  i ve only had this baby for about 2 weeks  i ve had bluetooth headsets in the past  and finally got away from them because it seems like you are always battling with getting the damned thing to pair up  not so with this unit   when i first connected to my tablet  of course i had to go into my tablet bluetooth settings  but just one time  ever since  even when the headset auto powers down from extended idle time  i just put them on  open my tablet  press the multifunction pairing volume button on the headset  and  voila  beautiful sound  i use this headset almost exclusively with a single tablet   i m guessing pairing to multiple devices might add an additional degree of complexity to the process  but that s never an issue for me  my hearing isn t what it used to be  so i am used to cranking up the volume  but  man   these babies are loud   even my feeble ears can only tolerate about half volume  as far as sound quality  i won t say these produce true high fidelity sound  but that s not what i bought them for   mostly watching movies and youtube  where the sound quality and bass response is without criticism  a bonus is the plug in cable that comes as an accessory  so i suppose if you had a non bluetooth device just can just plug it right in and enjoy your sound  truly an astounding product for the price  why pay more 
great buy  comfortable and good sound
believe i finally found a great set of headphones  at a very good price  they look super nice  quality seem sturdy  well made   and the fit is extreamly comfortable  i have yet to try them out at the gym  and wear them for a longer period of time   not to loose or tight  the sound is perfect for my use  meaning great quality for the gym  for super music enthusiast  i would go with more expensive brand   it would be nice if the volume could go a little higher  you will not get anything loud here  but the sound is good  paring with both my samsung s4 phone  and ipad 2 was very easy  as was charging  walked 10meters away from my phone  and the music was still perfect  the sound is the same quality  wheather bluetooth or direct cable connect  next i need to pair it with my lg tv  hopefully that will go as smooth as everything else  all in all  i will recommend these headphones  they fold up easily  very comfortable and good sound  all for about  35 00  update  i have used the headphones at the gym  and they are truly comfortable  have had them on for 2 hours without a problem  almost forgot i had them on  they do not do noise cancellation  but the sound is good  and they look sharp  got compliments   still easy to connect and charge     love my headphones 
for the price you absolutely cannot best these headphones
for the price you absolutely cannot best these headphones  i ordered these for my wife to use during a trip from dfw to seatac and nearly didn t give them to her because i liked them so much  pairing is quick and simple just press and hold the power button and you are good to go  sound quality will blow you away considering what you paid for these  i ve bought many headphones in my life some very expensive and some very cheap  these sound like they should cost about  120 the bass isn t amazing but that d alright with me  passive noise cancelation is nothing like active noise cancelation  all these do is isolate you from the outside world and as such anything too high pitched or too low pitched will still make it through  but once the music is playing you won t be able to hear the outside world at all  battery life has been outstanding so far as well i haven t actually managed to fully kill them yet but they did last from the moment i got through security st the airport to when i stepped into my ride at the other side a good 10 hours later  my only real problem is the fact that instead of just a beep when at full volume it actually has a voice telling you that and it can be a bit annoying 
great quality headphones at an excellent price 
i had a month of traveling and i tried to use ear buds on the plane on my first trip  ear buds were almost completely useless and i started looking for a set of noise cancelling earphones as soon as i got home  i m happy to say that these made my second trip much better  these aren t miracle earphones  i was still aware that i was on an airplane  but i was able to listen to gentile meditation and relaxation music on the plane and i only heard a slight buzzing in the background from the plane engines  when i took the headphones off the talk to the attendant  i was amazed how loud the plane cabin was outside these headphones  they cut out a good 90  of the noise  they are comfortable enough for me  and the folding feature was handy  they easily fit into my purse while going through airport security  you ll need to read the instructions to get the hang of the controls  pretty much  you just hold down the power button until it turns on and pairs  and hold it again to turn off  i can t speak to the phone features  i m only interested in using these as traditional headphones  if you have an upcoming flight and are considering headphones  i can highly recommend these  if you want to spend  200 for some super duper headphones then go for it  but if you want something sturdy  affordable  and of good quality then these are great 
love these in office and lawncare setting 
go ahead and buy two pair  maybe three  i have to share mine with my wife  these are awesome  i bought these and a pair of mpow thor  these are much better  i wear them at work in my office job to drown out the distractions  as well as my side job  my lawn care business  they work very well to block out the loud engine noise and create a wonderful listening experience  i often listen to audiobook which are very easy to hear in a loud environment  these headphones have a rich and deep sound for music  as good as beats  to me  a very long battery cycle is nice  i charge mine maybe once a week if even that  and that s listening for a couple hours at work  then 2 4 in the evenings  they adjust well and fit nicely  they don t feel cheap  to be honest the thor model feels cheap and doesn t compare  on these  the controls are very nice and easy to use  the range is astonishing  i walk to the printer and forget to take my phone  no loss at all with many people and computers smartphones devices between  mowing  i ve left my phone on the mower and walked all the way around the house without loss or even a skip  sorry for the length  but i want to make sure i cover it all  i have not a single complaint in several months of hard use  buy them  buy these over the thor  sorry mpow to bash the thor but these are far superior  ordering a few more pairs soon  one to keep at work so i don t have to carry in and out  one for wife  one for uncle  thanks mpow for a great product 
excellent sound for the price
i have to listen to music while i m cutting the grass and my old bt headphones we re wearing out and just didn t cut it when sitting on my new mower  ztr with the engine right behind the seat   i didn t want to wear my  300  noise cancelling bose headphones for mowing the lawn  i just wanted a cheap set that would deliver the tunes and block out the engine noise and these fit the bill perfectly  i don t have to have them turned up all the way to hear the music and they sound surprisingly good  not quite bose quality but also not a  300 difference    they fit my head well and are comfortable throughout my 2 hour lawn mowing time  i can t comment on the phone related features because i haven t made or accepted any calls while wearing them  but  i can say that the pair to my iphone 6 easily every time and the music related controls work as you d expect 
fantastic for the price
i was definitely skeptical before i bought these  and i did a lot of research on wireless bluetooth headphones before i pulled the trigger  after reading a lot of reviews for other items  i came to the realization that most of the reviews were fake  this is not a fake review  i bought these so that i could easily listen to music while in the office  and i was getting sick of using the ear buds provided with my phone  i actually purchased another pair of headphones thinking that these mpow ones would be too cheap sounding for this price  i was wrong  the ones i bought sounded absolutely terrible and muddy  while these actually have a nice clean sound  the bass isn t overwhelming  but it is still definitely there  which i learned is a good thing for these headphones  pros    great value for price   very comfortable   easily paired   clean sound that still has bass cons    there aren t any tactile bumps on the controls  so you honestly have no idea which one you re pressing so far i am very happy with my decision to return the other headphones and get these ones instead 
i love mine but i ll keep ya updated on how long they last  which might be a while they look and feel durable 
mpow is quickly becoming my go to heat set for everything sound related  my first headset from them was just tiny wireless bluetooth earbuds and i love them  i bought them about 2 years ago and they are still going strong and the battery still lasts forever which is incredible  since i needed a new headset for my computer instead of my phone yet again i decided instead of the usual which is usually turtle beach and lasts about a year i would check out mpow s offering  this is the headset i decided to get and i m not disappointed with my first impressions  comfortable  acceptable sound quality and they feel sturdy  they can be wired or wireless which is a huge plus for me since 50  of the time the wire breaking down on turtle beach is the problem and then the other is turtle beach just falls apart because it s cheap plastic  this has metal in obvious strategic locations so i have a good feeling these are going to last awhile hopefully and if they break  metal is much easier to fix than cheap plastic  overall perfect fit and i have a relatively big head so size matters here  i think they hit the perfect dimensions to accommodate our different sized cue balls so if mpow keeps up the great work i doubt i ll buy anything other than mpow for as long as they keep pushing out great headphones  cons   a very slightly heavy but you don t notice it after you put them on and think awwwwww yyeeeeaaaahhh thems some comfortable ear cups  honestly  it s not a big deal and just now i took them off and gave them a few bounces in my hand and they didn t seem heavy but my initial impression was they were a bit weighty so i m sticking in on here anyway  sound quality could be better but honestly  they sound epic enough to satisfy me so could be improved but overall what a fantastic headset  great job mpow love the name love their headsets more  on a side note if you get these head over to youtube a google  falcon heavy sounds  you won t be disappointed   if you like rockets  sonic booms  and tesla roadsters in space 
unbeatable sound  comfort  and ease of use for the price  best headphone deal on amazon 
lets cut to the chase  q  how do they sound  a  excellent  in truth  they have very little character of their own  which is a good thing  a very good thing  the bass is not as extended as some much more expensive phones  but what s there is clean and not boomy as some have reported  what really impresses me is their ability to portray depth  which isn t easy for a sealed design  there is no upper midrange  clarity bump   zippy highs or serious resonances  they compare very well with my much more expensive wireless sennheisers in fact  i bought these for hearing protection while mowing the lawn  but their comfort  great sound and ease of use makes me think i ll be using them for indoor use  commuting and dogwalking as well  in short  these cans are a superb deal  i have already recommended them to a few friends and will be buying more as christmas presents  i love these cans 
tight  but fixable
overall  great value  sound is very impressive with these for the price and it s great to control the music with headphone buttons  mic is ok but not good enough imo to use for work  it sounds good on my end  but the people on the other end will not likely enjoy it for very long  headphones too tight  fix them by using a hair dryer on the plastic and bending them out carefully  or to be more cautious  by using a torx size t7 bit to take the clips off  and bending the metal  and also applying heat to carefully bend the plastic  be careful  the screws are small    and if you brake the plastic  you did it wrong     
after a month  no complaints
for the price  these are great  after over a week of around 1 5 hrs a day of gym run time at near max volume  the headphones still hold a little over half of their charge  pairing was a breeze  all buttons work just fine  and sound is pretty clear  bass is great  treble is a little too sharp for rock metal but that can be remedied through on a music player app  will update in a couple months  update 1  a month later  i just experienced my first low battery beeps after over a month of the initial charge  i cant really compare to higher end dre beats or bose  but the battery longevity for the price is outstanding 
great for hard of hearing
we have a unique situation where my brother  who has down syndrome is very hard of hearing  and refuses to wear his hearing aid  he is also autistic  and spends a great deal of time in his room watching one game show after another  i doubt he could hear much  and i m certain he missed out on half if not all the voices  sooooo   i found these headphones on amazon  and they had a great rating  bought a blue tooth thingy to connect them to the tv  i saw my brother smile for the first time in forever  he was able  even with his hearing loss  to hear the tv  even if he goes down the hall to another room  the voice from the tv carries  i would have spent 1000  for these headphones that have made such a difference in the quality of his life  they are so comfortable  the clarity is outstanding  the range is waaaaay more than i would have thought possible  i would recommend these for anyone hearing impaired  the difference between silence and being able to interact with sounds from tv  or radio would make a huge difference for the hearing impaired 
so far so good 
ok so i bought the patterned fx victoria for  27 and then yesterday i got these mpow for  37  as you can see the mpow are a little larger and cover the entire adult ear  the sound is better on the mpow  because it covers entire ear  and the material feels sturdier  now the fx victoria i ve had for months and they work great and have no regrets  i ll use the mpow some more and update later if necessary  but for adults i d get the mpow and for kids the fx victoria 
these headphones are good  
these headphones are good     but sadly the pair i purchased lost blue tooth function after two weeks  15 days   since i used these solely for gym work it made them worthless to me  i attempted to contact the manufacturer for replacement or repair but the website  contact  button didn t work  based on those facts i have to complain about these phones  but i will say that prior to the bluetooth failure i was happy with the product  just that without it these are just another wired pair of headphones and now i have to buy a new set  not mpow   mpow if you are reading this i would still love to hear from you so we can get these fixed  update       and mpow sent me another one that works just perfect  its comfortable  which is important since i use them for gym work  and the new one has been going strong for over a month already  i want to thank mpow for this since it makes me a loyal customer in the future when you stand behind your product this well 
i m absolutely satisfied with these headphones
i m absolutely satisfied with these headphones  especially wireless for such a low price point  sound quality is much better than my last similarly priced wired headphones  i m not an expert in sound quality but personally i don t find flaws at all  microphone is amazing  i m not even sure where it s located  but sound quality is great over skype  so it s really 10 10 considering the price point  there s two minor issues  that hardly worth mentioning    there s an option to connect to 2 devices simultaneously but it s not working well if you listening to music on your phone and browsing internet on your connected desktop at the same time  in other words if you listen to one device with another one occasionally activating   well sound quality will noticeably drop when both devices playing sounds    if you don t listen to constant stream of sounds for a while they have activation delay maybe half a second or so  it s a very specific issue that not everyone will notice  gamers  music listeners  movie watchers won t notice it  but if you doing exercises at khan academy  that  completed  sound will play with delay each time  unless you listen to some music also  but like i said these issues are minor and hardly worth mentioning 
almost perfect  and fabulous for the price
very nice headphones  they fit my average sized head very well  they feel snug  almost like they could be too snug  but they remain comfortable for several hours  the look and build quality are nice  it s all plastic except for a few key parts  but they have a sturdy feel and i find them fairly stylish  controls are intuitive  with a typical 4 way circular rocker with a center button  up and down for volume and right and left for track is easy to remember  i almost took off one star for sound quality  but decided i was being too harsh  compared to a  300 pair of headphones  they are a bit lacking  with a sound that is not as crisp and punchy as i would like  but compared to most under  50 headphones  they are outstanding  the bass is sufficient and never overbearing and the mids and highs are pretty well balanced and open sounding  just not as 100  fresh as i would wish for  that said  i think they sound better than a  120 pair of sony bluetooth phones i tried recently and returned  overall  these are a great value and a very satisfactory product 
amazing sound  cheap price and a snug fit  with a pretty decent build 
i was looking for some over ear headphones that i could use to work out with  i chose these because of the reviews and pricing  i chose over ear primarily because i wanted wireless  and headphones that weren t going to constantly fall out my ears  these head phones come in a plane packaging  with an aux cable and soft carrying bag for the headphones  the headphones fit pretty snug which is nice because when i went running they were falling off or sliding back  they held up perfecting fine  the sound quality was really good  i expected some pretty bad lows or even bad highs but the headphones have a great balance  pairing it by bluetooth to my cell phone was pretty easy  if you can follow directions   the build quality is ok  the gloss black seems like it would scratch easily  i use this for both running and lifting weights  and it hasnt had any issues with falling off at all  great headphones for the price
dont hesitate  click add to cart  you wont be disappointed 
great headphones  quite honestly didnt believe theyd be for the low price  i bought them for my 10yo son  he uses them mostly for his tv and they hook up easily to his apple tv and then when he chooses they seemlessly hook to his phone  he says they even pause play his apple tv as well as control it as well  my sons says he feels as if hes in the shows lol  without a doubt this is a great buy 
great comfort for the value
great set of headphones for the cost  very comfortable  cool looking  and easy to use  a single charge seems to last about 12 hours of continuous use   but since i don t use mine continuously  i can get about a week of intermittent use out of them  you need to install the headphone drivers  and make sure your device is bluetooth enabled  my computer didn t have bluetooth  so i purchased a usb 4 0 bluetooth transmitter  there s a moment where the headset syncs with the computer  then you get sound through the headphones  if you re going from wired to wireless sound  the audio quality is really good   there s some very minor static or feedback  very minor  so i noticed it wasn t the same as wired quality  but nothing that really bothered me for long  overall  i really like this as a replacement for my wired headset   no cords is a huge improvement  the cord kept getting caught on my arm or chair  and moving my chair the rollers would often roll over the wire    which was bad  all of that worry is gone now  awesome upgrade 
re review   new headphones
i purchased the mpow 059 headset and originally submitted a 2 star review based mainly on the low volume issues  however  i am submitting a new review and changing it to a 5 star rating based mostly on their customer service  when they saw my rating they offered to send me a different set of headphones and when i accepted  they sent me the mpow h2 headphones  now  these new headphones have a very slightly higher volume and they are on ear instead of over ear  but the sound quality is better   more crisp  like i said above  this is a little tricky since this 5 star rating is based primarily on their customer service and their desire to resolve the issue and not on the quality of their product  i guess you get what you pay for and this is one of the pitfalls of buying on line and not actually testing the products in person  i applaud mpow for trying to make this right
