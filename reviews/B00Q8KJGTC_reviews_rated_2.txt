for such a great price  i should have known that the quality    
i bought ewei s 3 floating u shelves in both the white and espresso finish because i wanted to decorate my living room and bedroom  for such a great price  i should have known that the quality would be compromised  the seller advertises that the shelves come with all of the necessary hardware and are  easy to hang   boy  is this the overstatement of the century  the plastic drywall anchors are cheaper than dirt  and frankly work just as well  the anchors don t have a cap  they re flimsy  and i certainly don t trust them to hold up a shelf  of the 6 total drywall anchors  3 broke completely and two fell behind the wall  these are trash  i decided to play it safe and buy my own drywall anchors from ace hardware to hang the shelves  i would highly recommend that anyone who buys these shelves does the same  it s disappointing that ewei would overlook such a critical component of their product to maximize profits  if you re looking for convenience  buy another company s shelves because anything is better than the hardware that ewei provides  the shelves themselves are great  but they are a little bit smaller than i expected them to be 
smaller than they appear
pictures give a misleading idea on size  these shelves don t have much depth  make sure to check out the dimensions description closely prior to buying  if you need three tiny shelves  these seem to be nice otherwise 
small
way too small for kids books i can only fit the really small ones on there  also seems very cheaply made  might be good for dvds
kind of flimsy
not the easiest to install  the hardware is a bit on the cheap side  the shelves can t carry too much weight either  i was really looking forward to these shelves  but when it came it it looked as it had been previously installed used  i returned them and am looking for different floating shelves
