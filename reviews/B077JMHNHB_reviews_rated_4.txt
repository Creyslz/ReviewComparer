the swiveling cups allow them to find a sweet spot to have them sit both comfortable and help    
surprisingly these have impressed me when i did not expect it  they are light weight and and have several adjustments that can be made to have them fit most people very well  the cups are soft  cover your ear well and do not put that squeezing pressure against your head  the swiveling cups allow them to find a sweet spot to have them sit both comfortable and help keep outside noises  the drivers are decent and can push a good amount of volume out for your enjoyment  the sounds are clear and not really much distortion on the bottom ends  which surprised me the most  i have come across headphones at twice this price and were not as good as these  for the price i can not see many people being unhappy with this selection 
this is a good product  i wish they were over the ear
this is a good product  i wish they were over the ear  but they have good sound quality and great range  the cord is nice and long too 
worked excellent at first
i m giving these 3 5 stars only because their customer service was impeccable  the headphones worked for maybe a month  and then they started to malfunction  the volume would go up and down on its own  it would open up some weird app on my phone that was disabled  and also drop calls  at first they worked they great  no issues at all  they are a little large and i have a regular sized head but nothing that was too much of an issue  i contacted customer service about what was happening and they resolved the issue with no hassles  i would recommend these because i m thinking maybe i got a bad pair because most of the reviews are excellent 
does not block noise when not turned on
a previous review suggested that these on ear phones would black out extraneous noise  not true  actually  noise from ambient music and conversations passes easily into these headphones  having said that  the phones do a decent job of blocking out ambient conversations and music when in operation  it is not necessary to turn up the volume to a dangerously high level  the sound quality  judging by other phones i have owned  is very good for phones in the sub  20 range 
on ear headphones
bought two red pairs and one blue  the red pairs have been really durable for two young boys and they work great  the blue pair for whatever reason only one side works and that was with 48 hours hence the reduction in stars 
i like the build of these headphones
i like the build of these headphones  4 stars because there is an issue with connecting them to a 3 5mm to 6 5mm stereo adapter   the talk button must be engaged to achieve full audio fidelity since these are 4 ring and not 3 ring  so if you are using them with a stereo adapter you will have to put a binder clip on the talk button and tape it down  fine for plugging into mobile devices  though 
nice for the price
these really are great headphones  the sound is very clear and i loved that they came in colors   i got the blue ones  only one minor problem  they are a little tight on my head  but for the price  i m satisfied with this product and would recommend it to others 
love the look and feel but when i tried it    
love the look and feel but when i tried it in my kindle for an audible book it didn t work
better than expected
the sound quality is so much better than expected  i can actually fold them down to fit in a pocket  cord is durable and long  which is a good thing  i only wish they fit a little more snug  as i m usually pretty active while wearing them  they ve slipped off a couple of times  the on off vol button is easy to get a feel for 
excellent customer service
the sound quality is pretty good  but the transition from the black plastic to foam has uncomfortable plastic corners that sometimes dig into your skin when you rest the headphones on your neck  the left audio stopped working after minimal use  but the seller was very accommodating and immediately offered a replacement  the quality of the headphones is pretty good given their price  but the customer service that comes with them is excellent 
you only get what you pay for 
the headphones are good enough for my purposes  but i wish they were better at canceling out the background noise i usually use them when watching a movie on my laptop 
for my grandson
i just gave them to him for his 7th birthday  he is very hard on earphones so if these last i will give them a five star rating 
he loved them the price was very good
it was a valentinesday gift for my husband to replace his broken ones  he loved them the price was very good 
awesome    kind of
awesome   extremely fast shipping  sounds good  but the volume control doesnt work 
a good value
haven t used them extensively yet  but i m pleased with the sound quality and fit  i especially like that they fold up compactly for travel 
sound quality is excellent
sound quality is excellent compared to the one that come with cell phones  comfort  way more comfortable than ear buds
