product went bad before one year
product went bad before one year  bought protection plan  but both asurion  the company that sells protection plan  and the manufacturer both refused to replace since there is no serial number at the base of the motor and also we didn t receive any protection plan info in the box 
couldn t be more disappointed       
now i am really peeved  this is the 2nd nutri ninja i have purchased  the first one lasted for a decent amount of time before it began smoking and a horrible burning rubber smell filled my house  but i had used it a lot so chalked it up as normal wear and tear  debated on buying another  but decided to go ahead because i drink a smoothie for breakfast maybe 2 3 times a week and the nutri ninja does a good job of chopping ice  i bought the 2nd one in june  less than 3 months ago  this morning it started smoking and that burning rubber smell happened again  so into the garbage it goes  will not be a fool and buy this product again  clearly the design is inferior  try a different brand 
less than 30 days of use and it s dead 
after less than two years of very sporadic use  it does not work any more  the blender was bought to be used at a location i visit ever 2 3 months for a week  if you add up the total usage  it won t reach 30days of use  is this blender meant to die after such low use  it s not the most expensive blender  but it s not cheap for such bad performance 
it broke one month after the lousy warranty expired  oy vey 
the ninja stopped working today and so after making sure it wasn t the outlet or anything else i decided to get out the warranty information on it  it comes with a 12 month warranty  the warranty says that if the ninja breaks during the warranty period you have to pay to ship it to their facility and also include a check for  19 95 to  cover return shipping and handling   i was furious thinking about having to pay 2 3 of the cost of a new item only to get a factory refurb as a replacement  well  it just so happens that the ninja i bought is 13 months old so even that lousy warranty isn t an option  will never buy ninja brand again 
will damage your hearing
the only other blender i have owned that was this loud was a broken blendtec that had to be repaired  the first one was so loud i assumed it was defective and had it replaced  the second is just as bad and leaves my ears ringing after use  i work around power tools alot and my table saw is quieter than this blender  maybe i got 2 duds in a row but that is as much a reason to not recommend this product as the noise issue  by the way i have a blender collection as i am a bit of a smoothie fiend  i have plenty of experience with blenders and really wanted this cheaper alternative to be my new goto 
it s in perfect condition but the motor is dead
very frustrating  i bought this item in may 2017 and used it about 10 times and it no longer works at all  it s in perfect condition but the motor is dead 
blender throws electric sparks from the bottom
received the item last week and it throws electric sparks from the bottom when in action  if you leave a white clothes underneath then it covers it with black residue  i have just tried it once and it seems not safe at all  thanks to amazon s great customer service  i got full refund 
does not do well with frozen fruit 
my old ninja master prep was wearing out after 5 yrs or more of use  this blender will not make  smooth  smoothies with frozen fruit as well as the prep  i returned and will order the original 
very loud 
shipped timely  but machine doesn t work properly  when i put the blender and the container on the base to blend  it makes a horrible loud noise and the base vibrates a lot  at present i am very disappointed and not happy with it  i have other ninja products and am very satisfied with them  i would return this 
one star
pieces don t fit the machine
