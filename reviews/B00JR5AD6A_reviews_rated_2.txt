it exploded
i ve had this blender for under a month and use it to make smoothies  this morning  i was making my smoothie like usual  the blender started making weird noises  smoke started coming out from under it  and then weird pieces of burnt plastic started flying out from it 
this was a great little blender for about 3 months when we used    
this was a great little blender for about 3 months when we used it for primarily fresh  softly frozen or almost thawed fruits and yogurt  frozen fruit with yogurt and milk killed it  absolutely burned up the motor and filled our house with a stinky burning smell   i am disappointed in this product and will not buy another 
very small 
the  large  part of the blender is very small  contents do not fill a mason jar  i wanted it because the thought of being able to take the portable cups was appealing  i would return it  but the box got thrown away  there is also only one button option 
not very happy with this
not very happy with this  i thought the to go cups would be nice but it doesn t make up for the loss of power  it left ice cube chunks as well as chunks of frozen strawberries in my smoothies  kind of defeats the purpose of a smoothie
so it is super easy to spill them
it doesn t blend very well and the lids of the cups don t have a way to close  the holes are open   so it is super easy to spill them it would be nice if there was an adjustment to blend the cups themselves instead of using the big blender to pour into the cups 
refund was quick and fast 
was a good blender while it worked  but just quite turning on one day  i used every day but only for 2 weeks then it quite  returned for full refund  bought a different kind  so far no problems 
i m sure it s a fine blender  but who wants to deal with all    
i m sure it s a fine blender  but who wants to deal with all these pieces  it doesn t fit a mason jar as someone indicated in the questions  and it comes with a ton of varying sized plastic containers  the main blender part is weirdly small   maybe enough for two big smoothies  i m returning it 
the cups are a nice add on
you get what you pay for  the blender doesnt mix well unless you add alot of water  the cups are a nice add on  but the lids leak  i ve been using this for a month for shakes in the morning and it takes forever to blend properly  next time id just invest in a decent blender 
good luck with this blender
good luck with this blender  if you put ice in it it basically clogs up  it doesnt blend worth a crap  you get what you pay for on this product 
two stars
it s a decent little machine for the price  tends to over heat and smoke if your not careful
