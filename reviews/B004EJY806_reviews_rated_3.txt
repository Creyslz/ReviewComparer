1 was perfect  the other was flawed 
i bought two of these shelves  the first one was a 5 star shelving unit  no flaws  perfect  the second unit is why i ve marked you down a bit  there were stains all over one of the shelves  there are some type of sticky smudges on the black shelf top  and on the underside of same board  there are fingerprints  which i can only assume are in oil of some kind  but it s the index finger  middle  and ring ringer  a clear print of those fingers right down to the 2nd knuckles  i would have given you 5 stars if there was any consistency between the two shelves i ordered  but you don t get a 5 star rating for shoddy work and a lack of quality control  as for as putting them together  it was very easy  but also very painful  you have to twist and twist and twist the poles  which screw into each other  and my forearms were killing me after a few minutes  this is where having a man in the house might have come in handy  but they do seem sturdy enough for my plants and crystals  i also like the way the units look  very clean and open  all other shelves i ve had are closed on each end  but since these are open  it provides really good light opportunities for plants  i would like to get another unit for the spare room and use it as a pantry shelf  but again  with the lack of quality control  i am not sure i would order from this company again 
twisting   twisting   and more twisting 
seems like a stable little shelf  just bought it   and will suit the purpose for which it was purchased but it takes longer to get it screwed in than 15 minutes  my hands kept getting tired from it so i had to take breaks  to get the legs started in each hole was a bit of a challenge  however  once you accomplished that  you just had to keep twisting and twisting and twisting and twisting  well you get the idea   
but i wouldn t recommend this for heavy things because it s not that sturdy
i received the product and immediately put it together because i needed storage  this worked out alright  but i wouldn t recommend this for heavy things because it s not that sturdy  you can bolt it to the wall for added strength but i didn t do this yet  as i just needed to stow away some lighter things and get them out of the way  all in all this cabinet worked well for me  i placed it into a corner so that it was surround by two walls and a dresser  thanks
ok for first apt
i bought 2 for 18 00 each shipped from amazon warehouse deals  they re light weight sturdy shelves  not to be used to hold very heavy books  maybe books on half the shelves  i bought for my sons first apartment  he uses to display his loot crate items  i wouldn t use these in a room with kids under 12  they re not made for heavy use  it s made of particle board 
decent enough for the price  21
so you would never mistake this for high quality shelves but it s completely acceptable at right at twenty bucks  i m going to use it for seasonal display of my holiday figurines  my was scratched and damaged along the edges   i used wood markers and my art supplies to  repair  the damage rather than mess with sending it back 
its ok for the price 
3 stars means it about what i expected for the price  install is very easy and fast  there were a few small chips and scratches on the shelves but not that noticeable  its not the sturdies shelve  meaning it can wobble a little  overall for the price and for what i bought it for  its not bad
