i bought 2 of these and they were defective  returned those and got more defective items
two stars because if i could have put these together they would have been great  i bought 2 of the 4 tier shelving units and was greatly disappointed  all of the legs are supposed to have threads so that everything can be screwed together without hassle  4 of the legs did not have threads and made it so i could only half way put them together    so i returned the original ones thinking i would get the right pieces when they shipped me new ones  nope i received two new shelves with the same exact problem  do not waste your time or money on these because they all seem to be defective  i don t know if anyone else has experienced this issue with these before but for me it was not worth it  i have returned all four shelves and will not be ordering these again  amazon was really great in this process though and did help me out so much so i do not blame amazon  i blame furinno for making defective products and not checking everything before they package items up 
to be fair 2 stars is too much  im    
to be fair 2 stars is too much  im using it to put my watches  wallet  pill containers etc  on it  i dont know how it got scratched  you can see from the pitures there is no metal or anything could scratch
got a heavy 3 d printer 
looks and feels super cheap  plastic hollow tubing makes up the rickety supports  i wouldn t put anything fragile on it  no matter what it weighs  especially unsteady on carpet  spend the money  cheapskate  i was once just like you  just like yooooooooo    seriously  it s cheaper looking than i the picture
