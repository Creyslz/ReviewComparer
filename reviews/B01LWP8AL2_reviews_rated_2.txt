disappointed 
i was definitely disappointed by the quality of this product  this is the first time i have received an amazon basics product that i don t feel is great quality  first  the box showed up in pieces  there was a literal trail of small pieces of the rack  including the instructional book  from the delivery truck to my door  when i opened the box shards of excess plastic pieces fell all over the place  thankfully  it seems those were just all junk extras  the actual metal rack was also pretty banged up in the shipping process  there is some marred pieces of shelf in the form of bent metal and missing paint  this ended up being a two person assembly project  the instructional booklet  which i almost needed to invite a mouse with bifocals over to read for me  was unclear  it would have been nice also if there was some sort of indication of where to place the racks to evenly space them out instead of having to count and divide or just do guess work  in the end  i got the shelf up  it fits the space i need  but i don t have a lot of faith in it  the bottom legs seem to be pointed inward as well instead of straight  i m not impressed  disappointed in this amazon product 
inconsistent product   shipped undeliverable from amazon
the quality is acceptable for the price but not as good as other wire shelving i have purchased in the past mainly because of the strength and number of the cross wires on the shelves themselves  still it serves the purpose  heres my two issues  1  amazon uses the same product name   description   part number even though they changed what is in the box within the last year  i bought one to match up to another i have and the pole height and grip marks do not match the product from a year ago  you cant math shelf height placement and the new one is about 1 5 taller  so it just looks odd sitting next to the other one  2  they shipped it usps and its overweight so the mail carrier wouldnt deliver it  i had to drive to the post office during their business hours and bring a little card and my license for them to dig it out so i could take it home and build it  it would have been more convenient to just buy another product that doesnt match what i already have at a local retailer   at least the hours to pick it up would have been better than usps 
two stars
good price to buy  but my order just missing pieces  and the product is sold by amazon
poor quality recommend a different brand
bought these because they looked exactly like other shelves we had purchased from home depot  they are not the same or equivalent  while the design appears to be the same  the quality of these shelves is terrible  we purchased 4 units and almost all pieces  poles and shelves  were warped or bent in some way  it was sort of ridiculous  we love amazon and did not expect this  we were able to make them work for the most part  one shelf was completely unusable but it would be such a hassle to return so we just have one unit with 3 shelves instead of 4  definitely dont recommend these  buy a different brand
