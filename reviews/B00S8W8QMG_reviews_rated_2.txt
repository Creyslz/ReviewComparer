it s not really wall mount ready 
we got this because we needed a wall mount monitor  we wouldn t have bought it if we had known that the neck piece was not removable  imho  it s not wall mount ready if it is going to look bad on the wall 
doesn t actually have a dvi port
the description says it has hdmi  vga  and dvi ports  but in reality it does not have dvi  just two hdmi ports and one vga port  other than the misleading description  its a decent enough monitor at a good price 
how many dead pixels 
the first day i turned it on it had a dead pixel and one pixel with a brightness issue  but because it has less than 3 5 pixels  it s considered within advertised quality or whatever  i d recommend getting a different monitor for a little more money 
the size is perfect for what i need
the size is perfect for what i need  but none of the hdmi cable will work with my laptop  i have currently bought two and still not working  will try one more time  may need an adapter instead fro vga 
i bought this because it said it has vga     
i bought this because it said it has vga  dvi  and hdmi ports  it arrived and after opening it i found out it only has hdmi and vga no dvi  i never had a chance to turn the monitor on because of this  if you need dvi this does not have a dvi port as advertised
