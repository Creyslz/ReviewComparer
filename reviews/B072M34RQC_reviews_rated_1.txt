buy something else
i was happy   at first  then i realized that there are no labels on any of the buttons  you have to read a manual to figure it out what the buttons are for and the configuration is awful  only an engineer could design something so unhelpful 
color white is dull and grayish
i hate to write a negative add but feel compelled to do so in order to warn others about the color  white  not really being white  but more a dull white  almost a light gray  i have two other monitors besides this new hp monitor  the samsung monitors are1920x1080  model s23c570h   my samsung monitors display the color white as bleach white as expected  when placing this hp monitor next to the samsung  and then i display an open word document  the samsung looks white  the hp monitor looks like a dirty dull white  grayish   this is really annoying  of course  i did all the normal troubleshooting  factory reset  adjust the brightness  contrast  and color control  etc  i also tried changing the  viewing mode  and  photo  mode gives the closest to white  but the white is still dull and grayish in color  i also called hp tech support  but they were unable to help resolve the problem  other than this one issue  the monitor was fine  but this was an important issue and i will be returning the monitor
