nice but    
i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though 
windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is working
i have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool 
works well
windows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applications
