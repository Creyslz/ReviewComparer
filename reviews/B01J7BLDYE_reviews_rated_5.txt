very good umbrella
portable  discreet  convenient and very durable  it doesn t add a lot of weight to my backpack  there was one time that it flipped backwards but that was because i didn t hold it right and was a very very windy day  but besides that the umbrella remain like nothing would never happened 
does the job
considering that even if i bought a more expensive umbrella  i d need to end up buying another one a year from now because all umbrellas tend to take a beating from wind  rain  etc   i was happy with the product for the price  it does the job  works well  provides good coverage  i couldn t find any technical problems with the button that you push which opens the umbrella  it folds down easily and comes with it s own carrying case 
five stars
great and sturdy umbrella 
five stars
good
best umbrella for the price
great umbrella  very strong  works great in the wind  very compact and comes with a case so everything won t get soaked  great value  best umbrella for it s price point  the release button could be designed a little easier but the functionality of the umbrella makes up for it
nice auto umbrella
this umbrella is sturdy  withstanding a fair amount of wind and also very convenient with its automatic open functionality  it s also a great size  comfortably fitting two people  i am delighted with this purchase 
good value
great for my kids  good construction  good cost 
keeps everything nice and organized
no more chair sloppiness    i couldn t take the sloppy look in my bedroom when my stuff were either on a chair or hanging over the tv screen    besides of the point that my suit is not creased at work anymore  keeps everything nice and organized  and the wood finish blends it in the room like a piece of furniture which makes it even more awesome  would recommended it to everyone  
wind and rain proof  
i bought two of these as i was travelling to new york with my family and wanted something strong and compact to fit in my bag  they are fantastic it was raining very heavily one day and very windy and they both stayed up the right way and felt very sturdy  i was very impressed and would recommend this product and would definitely purchase more if required in the future 
my all time favorite  super clear  durable  and hd protectors
these are the best screen protectors that i have purchased for any of my phones  i originally bought them as an add on for my wife s phone and they worked so great that i bought another pack for my s5  i punched out the front cover of my otterbox and use these instead  people complain about getting lint under them when trying to apply to protectors  but honestly  it is like anything else in life  take your time and attention to detail  if you want something done correctly and done right  it takes time and it is very worth it  i wouldn t put it in a humid room after a shower  what i do is lay your phone on a flat surface under a light  use the wipe that comes with the kit and clean the surface of your phone  now look at the surface of your phone at an angle to the light  you can see every single spec of dust and imperfection on your phone  if you see something use the wipe to take it off  then hold a protector flat off the side to the phone with the application side facing down  peel that side down and off with your fingers holding the sides  like everyone used to hold cds  line up the top of the protector to the contours of your phone and let it fold down flat  and use the wipe to push out the bubbles 
five stars
it s big and portable  i carry it in my bag
perfect size and good quality
quality is really good  it fits in my handbag  i am impressed with the package  i didnt expect the umbrella will be inside  the umbrella is steady and light weight 
nice umbrella
this is a nice size umbrella  easy open and easy close  haven t used it much but seems very sturdy 
never going to bake without it 
i just got my muffin pan yesterday and i immediately bake 2 batch of muffins  one is using silicon muffin pan  the other one using the normal every day metal muffin pan  even though the dough is the exactly the same  what a big difference it is having silicon muffin pan  i spent 1 minute washing the silicon muffin pan while spending about 15 minute to try scrubbing the metal pan  every crumbs and stuff are easily wiped away from silicon pan  my muffin came out softer and less sticky than the other batch  from the same material   the other batch was hard and stickyand even burned  buy it  you will stop using the metal pan  i m getting a 2nd one 
easy push up and nice material umbrella
this is a great quality material umbrella  not plastic its waterproof nice material  i cant believe how great this umbrella is  easy to push up my kids and husband say its material is different from most other umbrella  got it just in time for the rain  couldnt have gotten any luckier with a better product  i would definitely recommend this product  it was also fast delivery and on time which is always a great thing for me  its been rainy this whole past week and my family and i have loved using this great umbrella that keeps you dry while raining  i still need more and will definitely get one 
haven t had to use it yet
perfect size  exactly what i need for all the trips around campus at work 
it s pretty darn handy
i ve never owned an automatic umbrella before  but it s pretty darn handy  you pull out the umbrella  press the button  and poof  it s held up very well  too  i would definitely buy another 
excellent quality  worth every penny
it is very good quality and worth every penny  i have two left hands so i was worried this will be a nightmare to figure out but it was relatively easy to assemble and my fiance loves it to set out his work clothes every night  i also really like the additional mirror  i have not seen that on other valet stands  all in all  it s a nice gift item  highly recommended
small  elegant umbrella
we got out hands on the windproof travel umbrella by newdora and we absolutely love it  the umbrella came in a box that you would find from apple  seriously  it s quite elegant for an umbrella box   this excellent umbrella is the perfect combo of portability  protection and durability  foldable to 13 inches  it is small enough to slip in a coat pocket  tote or bag  the water resistant canopy is made from premium micro weave 210t thread count fabric that is coated with water repellant treated teflon  windroof frame is made with 10 steel ribs that are tri folded for safety and strength  the fabric stretchers provide maximum canopy tautness and are made from an innovative combination of steel  fiberglass  and aluminum  our answers to the frequently asked questions below  can this umbrella fit in a back bag   absolutely  it can also fit in a brief case as well  can two adults fit under this umbrella  yes  but it s quite tight  great for couples  but not so much for any other pair  when closed  how long is it  about 13 inches  it s quite small  overall  we highly recommend purchasing this small  but elegant umbrella  great as a gift for travelers or even putting it in your car for those rainy days  like our review  hit the  yes  button below for it being useful  leave us a comment if you have any questions or send us an email  thanks for reading 
very useful on a daily basis 
perfect add on christmas gift for my husband who wears a shirt and tie to work everyday  he is  type a  and loves to walk in  take off his work clothes and prep for the next day  so  as he puts his clothes in the hamper which is in the closet  he grabs his outfit for the next day  he walks to his valet  lay out his clothes  including his socks   takes off his shoes  watch  and puts down his keys and wallet all in one place  so  this is a perfect  one stop shop  for him  this product is sturdy  reasonably priced and nice to look at  we love it and have no compaints so we would definitely recommend it 
five stars
this umbrella is very easy to use  i like the neutral color  this umbrella is prefect in size 
would buy again
nice   compact   came in a cute box with a little sleeve over the umbrella  i like how it has a easy to push button to open and close the umbrella  you do however still need to push the umbrella down with your hands to make it compact again 
great umbrella
great umbrella  i might even go as far as to say its the best umbrella ive ever used  works well and lite weight  i live in portland or and it rains non stop for 6 months  this works great 
very happy with the valet
very happy with the valet  something that i have needed for quite a while  i needed something that i could consolidate all wear and items that i need for a quick exit on the next morning  small footprint for the bedroom  easy to put together  took me about 15 minutes myself  sturdy and nice looking  well thought out piece 
easy clean up 
i bought this to replace those hefty pans and stoneware i ve been using for muffins  even with the paper cups  they were no fun to clean  i was very lazy with those monsters and left them sitting for days  soaking water in the cups to remove any excess muffin  ad they were still a bear to clean  i decided to try this silicon to see if it s more user friendly  no spray  no cups  but they didn t  pop  right out     i think we tried too soon  after a few minutes  the muffins were easier to get out with just a smidgen of leftover muffin in the cups  but clean up was super duper  not to mention  since they re flexible  you can easily bend and move the pan around to get to any leftovers  with a plastic pan scraper and water  i was able to remove all the excess fairly quickly  to me  that s worth something   i m a fan of clean up convenience  i m trying to decide which kitchen gadgets to replace with their silicon version next 
its handy
we had some pretty bad weather in nyc between the snow rain high windy days  having an actual wind proof umbrella comes in handy  my hubby been using it mostly since he commute viva subways and had to walk to the train often in the city  so having this umbrella which not only pretty strong doesnt fold or fall apart in the wind and he loved thats it had a button to open and close with  its a good buy will have to buy a few more for the rest of my household
no fuss  no mess
i bought this for my 12 yr old granddaughter to use when we baked together  the recipe was easy  press the refrigerated biscuit into the tin  fill with a seasoned ground beef mixture  top with a cube of cheese  and bake  we did not use any spray or grease in the pan  and i have to admit  i was concerned it would be s stuck mess  but everything popped out perfectly  the biscuits did take a few minutes longer to bake than the recipe specified  but we kept an eye on them  i left the pan with my granddaughter  who was in awe of it  my daughter loved that she could just throw it in the dishwasher when we were done  oh   i compared it to a metal muffin pan i have  and the cups are the same size 
excellent product  perfect clarity and absolutely no distortion 
this product was installed on a samsung galaxy s5  installation is not quite as easy as shown on the video  setting the exact alignment was a bit difficult and ruined the first protector   perhaps that is why there are three in the package  but when completed  there were no bubbles  and the clarity and display was perfect  i could not tell the difference between the bare screen and the screen with the protector installed  although slightly more difficult to install than so called wet screen protectors  where that type protector can be easily repositioned multiple times  the end result is that the wet screen protector has graininess and distortion  while this protector does not  i highly recommend this product  in addition a large micro fiber cleaning and four lint removal stickers are included  an additional suggestion  before applying the screen protector  thoroughly clean the phone using a screen cleaner and a separate microfiber cloth   not the one in the package   this removes smears  dust  and other foreign material and restores the screen to its original state  note  in a comparison between the dry type  ismooth  and the wet type  armor suit military shield  protectors  a check of the verizon wireless site shows only dry screen protectors are being sold 
very impressed  would buy again 
terrific protector  as recommended  i applied in a steamy bathroom to help reduce dust  there were still a few bits that i had to use the stickers to take off  but i managed to apply the first one bubble free with both others to spare  two things to keep in mind  1  if you re going to steam up your bathroom  i d suggest stripping down because holy crap  i was drenched after applying this thing for a few minutes with all my clothes on  2  if you need to peel the protector up to remove dust  after it is fully applied  don t use your nails  you ll end up damaging the edge of the protector and it ll never stick quite right after that  instead  press one of the dust sticker on the edge of the protector  and that will peel it up for you  so far  this protector seems incredibly fingerprint resistant  compared to the protectors that i used on my old s3  and smudges wipe off easily as well  i was kind of regretting not getting a tempered glass protector  but after a couple days with this one  i don t mind waiting until these are worn out 
convenient to use
i am so glad that i bought this umbrella in time enough for this rainy season  it rains almost everyday here  this umbrella is so convenient for both to use and to conveniently carry in the handbag  i can literally open and close it just with simple click using one hand which really helps when you have a baby in hand  it covers both me and baby pretty well  it came in a nice packing  great for both price and quality 
best you can get
great screen protectors  the best i have purchased since wrapsol went out of business  i will not buy any other brand of screen protector now  update  i recently had to replace this screen protector after close to 6 months since there was a scratch it in  i didn t replace it for a while because it looked like the scratch could have gone through and messed my screen up and i just did not want to see the phone screen scratched  you know the feeling   the scratch did not go through the screen protector    the screen was perfect with no marks at all  since they gave 3 screen protectors i actually have 1 left  their product is great  has a nice smooth finish  the touch is not affected at all  it is think enough that what i thought penetrated it actually did not  i can t begin to describe how happy i am with this product  and it was cheap too  especially since you got 3 protectors  very good quality 
perfection
i ordered these screen protectors for my new galaxy s5  the desire to protect my phone was mixed with the usual dread at having to install them  fight the bubbles  and go through the whole package before one looked acceptable  not this time  i watched the online video  please do this  really  the tips will make all the difference  and installation was a breeze  absolutely perfect with the first attempt  and for the very first time in my life  not even the tiniest air bubble  i am absolutely amazed  do not waste your time with any other screen protector  buy this  
i have alot of broken umbrellas on first use  this one is a keeper already 
honestly i buy alot of umbrellas  daily  consider i tried it immediately for today s rain  this was such a smooth cover  i love the the luxurious packaging too btw  size is definitely small where i can put in my bag and not have to feel too heavily impacted with the rest of my belongings  it s definitely sturdy with it s stainless steel built 
opens and closes with the touch of a finger
i ve never before had an umbrella that would close automatically  most will open with the touch of a button but when getting into a car  you need to use two hands   one to hold the umbrella and one to reach and close it  this umbrella allows you to reach over with your thumb while holding the umbrella and hit a button which closes it  so much easier 
easy to apply  invisible once it s on 
this was by far the easiest screen protector i have ever applied  i bought them before i realized my case came with one  so i initially use the one that came with my case  when it had to be replaced  i used the ismooth protectors  huge difference in application  they include stickers that help you remove dust  there s no way i could have gotten dust from the edges of the phone without them  the stickers didn t leave any residue  i was surprised that they didn t include a plastic applicator  but realized later i didn t need one  they include a cloth that is more than sufficient for pushing the bubbles out  and there weren t that many  once the screen protector is on  it was invisible  from the time i opened the package to the time i was finished was less than three or four minutes 
very happy with it
my previous very expensive and supposedly strong screen cover was getting excessively dinged up  so i bought these after reading reviews on various products  i m happy with it  i paid a lot less this time plus i have two more now if the first one gets dinged up  was very easy to put on  although i ve done enough of these over the years to know how to avoid dust and put it on straight  i do miss the smooth feel of the glass but i know it would get dinged up and this is relatively smooth and about the same as my last one that was supposedly top of the line  i thought about a glass protector but the last time i tried that it was expensive  too thick and much more difficult to put on  time will tell how it stands up to getting scratched and dinged up but i since i have two more  not a real concern 
love this umbrella
love this umbrella  it definately works well in the wind and great to use for a super sunny day as well  its nice and compact and the sleeve makes it really easy to store  would definately purchase again
sturdy
this has lasted over a year and has been flipped by high winds only in the worst storms  when it does flip inside out it easily shakes back to normal and handles a lot of force well  the automatic trigger is awesome  just keep in mind that the umbrella must fully close to auto open again  sometimes i am too weak to close the holder without pushing it against the ground  nevertheless ive never had an umbrella last so long
perfectly baked muffins that were released from the tray very easily  and the tray did not require much cleaning    
i have been struggling with regular non stick muffin trays for years  they usually lasted about 6 8 months then became so difficult to clean that i threw them out and bought another one  this time i decided to try a silicone tray  i was very skeptical putting in my first batch of muffins  especially because all of the muffins on the packaging seemed to be in cases  anyway  i decided to trust the instructions that said just to put the muffins straight in  without greasing the trays  huge success  perfectly baked muffins that were released from the tray very easily  and the tray did not require much cleaning afterwards  i would definitely recommend this tray  one thing to be aware of though   it s hard to pick up the tray once the muffin slots have been filled  i putting a baking sheet underneath it and that resolved the issue 
easy to apply on my galaxy s5
i ordered these protectors about two years ago  and i was just applying my third sheet  these protectors have held up nicely  they are easy to apply   today i just applied a cheap protector to my kid s phone  it was so frustrating   they include a cleaning cloth as well as several sticky tapes to help lift off any lint debris  you will want to make sure your screen is very clean when applying or you will end up with bubbles  this is true of any protector   an alcohol pad might be handy if your screen is not clean  i would buy these again and recommend these to others 
great quality and value 
so received my screen protector and am very happy  the film virtually is undetectable  and goodbye to awful smudges and fingerprints  i was not one of those who got it right the very first time  almost   and a lot was learned during my first attempts  i will share those lessons with prospective buyers  1  do apply in your bathroom while running a nice steamy shower to cut down on floating lint  this really works   2  do follow instructions 3  do not remove tab 2 until you are sure all air bubbles are removed  if you have to realign the film tab 2 allows you to do so without  picking  the film off with your nails and damaging the film  4  if you have an air bubble that s not moving i assure you there s tiny lint or debris trapped in there  5  the more you have to remove the film to adjust the more likely you are to get trapped debris  which is less likely if you follow points 1 and 2  overall great product at a great price 
great product      
these are great little umbrellas  they perform well and i ve used them for both rain and sun  actually  i sat at aalthough the rain was coming in sideways and the wind was blowing something treacherous  they were like a little protective shield for me  strong enough to hold in wind   i would highly recommend    
love it 
love it   if any bubbles appear you can easily remove them   it s super clear and high quality  only  one  screen protector comes for the price  but they send a nice cloth with it      nov  17th 2014 update    i was wrong     there are  3  screen protectors  per my husband   i ruined the first one by removing it too many times and then the bubbles would not go away  that is how i found out there were  2 more  protectors  i guess i read the package wrong too  ok so the  second  one we  he  applied went on like glass   no bubbles  nothing if you do it right   if you remove it too many times  then you re in trouble  hands down the clearest  smoothest protector i have ever purchased  
i hate when umbrellas upend
i hate when umbrellas upend  this umbrella has a very sturdy spine  it has a great span of coverage  and it fits in my bag  i am happy with this product 
a nice umbrella for its size
a nice umbrella for its size  got this for my wife who hates the rain and needs one in her purse where ever she goes  the umbrella is surprisingly smaller than initially thought but does holdup the wind as advertised  it had yet to break in this crazy weather which i give them kudos for 
amazing screen protectors and even better customer service
let me start this by saying that i have made dozens and dozens of purchases on amazon and this is the first review i have ever written  my experience has been so good with ismooth that i feel compelled to share  i purchased these screen protectors for my new samsung galaxy s5  i have had several different android and apple phones in the past and i have tried at least five different kinds of screen protectors  and i can confidently say the ismooth hd ultra clear screen protectors are the best  i am extremely picky about having even one speck of dust   bubble under my screen protectors  the installation videos provided by ismooth are very helpful  actually seeing the screen protector being applied to your specific device made it much easier to properly apply it myself  the installation was relatively easy and the dust removal stickers were key in making sure there weren t any dust particles or bubbles under the screen protector  once installed  the screen protector blends in to the point where you don t even see it  it is a little tacky to touch  at first  but after a day or so of use the screen protector feels just like the screen  the case i have on my gs5 wraps all the way around the bezel of the phone  so i was worried it would hit and interfere with the screen protector  ismooth s screen protector is so exact that the edges of the protector are within 1 2 mm from the edge of the case  close enough to cover the entire screen but not too big that it interferes with the case  each pack come with three screen protectors  only hours after i installed my first protector i dropped my work phone  with an aluminum case  on the screen on my samsung galaxy s5  a large ding appeared and i feared i had cracked my screen  after peeling the screen protector off i realized the screen didn t suffer any damage whatsoever  the screen protector worked perfectly  ismooth claims they have a lifetime replacement guarantee for as long as you own your device  i emailed ismooth to request a replacement screen protector for the once i scratched  i received a very friendly email from customer service rep  brooke  within an hour  brooke asked for my mailing address  which i provided  and she informed me a replacement set of screen protectors would arrive within three days via usps first class mail  i received a 3 pack of screen protectors in 2 days  amazing  this was truly the easiest and most helpful customer service interaction i have ever experienced  ismooth has created an incredible screen protector and their customer service is second to none  i will use ismooth for all of my electronic purchases in the future 
very nice compact umbrella
very nice compact umbrella  it is very light weight and opens just in a click  best part is price  i have bought umbrella before for similar price but did not lasted a week  this umbrella was able to hold rain and wind together although cloth looks thin  i am very much delighted with purchase 
very clear and easy to install perfectly with a little bit of patience
as the name states  these are ultra clear screen protectors  if it wasn t for the outline around the earpiece speaker  home button and the forward facing camera  you wouldn t even know they are installed  installation was pretty easy  just be patient and very meticulous while installing  i spent about 20 30 minutes installing them on two phones  one each one i had to peel the bottom part of the protector off to get a small amount of dust   debris off of the bottom edge  since they include  dust removal stickers   which are nothing but page marking flags  available at any wal mart or office depot   removing the dust was no problem whatsoever  as with most things in life  you get what you put into something  if you peel the plastic off and throw it on the screen  your results will most likely reflect the amount of time you spent installing it  i wanted both mine and my wife s to look prefect  so i took my time  both are perfect  we have no trash or bubbles in either of them  the only thing that i think would have made it better is if they put the step  1 plastic removal tab at the bottom of the protector instead of the top  i personally think they are easier to install from the bottom up because you have the home key to use as a good starting reference for both your up   down and left right placement 
now i know what a 5 star product truly is   
i don t usually write reviews but love this product so much on my new galx s5 phone that i want to tell you all about it    fist off   they make it a very easy install with a 4 step installation instructions card   follow it step by step and you will too love the results second   the quality of this ismooth product is outstanding for this low cost premium hd screen protector and you get  3  for the price of others 1    third  it is as clear as the new screen on my phone with absolutely no bubbles or trapped lint had to look twice to make sure it was really there    finally  amazon shipped in 2 days as promised i was a little worried after purchasing my galaxy s5 and taking a chance of no screen protector for the first 2 days    if your planning on getting the phone than order in advance    noworries       ps  finally a well deserved product of its 5 star rating and i will be now looking into all other ismooth products cause of their attention to details and cares of us customers    thank you ismooth          
an actually easy installation
i have used a lot of screen protectors and this has got to be the best   easiest  first of all  it s extremely well packaged in a little pouch  when you open the pouch  the flap indicates the website where you can watch the installation video  honestly  i only watched the video after i already applied the screen protector  but it seemed very informative and thorough  it even suggested to use a lint brush or apply the screen protector in the bathroom after a steamy shower to avoid dust and lint  i didn t do either but still had a really great result   usually i buy screen protectors in packages of two or three because  it takes me two or three times to get it right  but in this case  i still have my two spare screen protectors safely saved in their pouch  it worked extremely well after the first attempt with no air bubbles whatsoever  i was very amazed  this was definitely the easiest  fastest and best result screen protector application i have ever had  you can t see that there is a screen protector on the phone whatsoever  it s even smooth and seamless near the edges  which is where i have usually found pesky bubbles that keep coming back with other protectors  i would highly recommend this screen protector to anyone looking to protect their device  or replace a screen protector which is ruining the look of your device 
essential smartphone product
in my opinion  a screen protector is a must have accessory when investing in a phone  this product from ismooth is a very good value for the money and gives you everything you need to protect your screen  there are 3 screen protectors provided which is awesome so you always have a couple of spares on hand  additionally  the package contains some little stickers to remove dust and debris  a rather large sized microfiber cleaning cloth and adequate  easy to read instructions  the installation is straight forward  clean phone s surface with cloth  remove layer one from product  place on phone and remove layer 2  i am a stickler for little air bubbles so i used the little dust remover stickers to remove any bit of dust and got almost everything off  the fit of the film on the screen was perfect  it is maybe a millimeter more narrow than the actual screen itself which gives you some wiggle room if it is not aligned perfectly and the hole on the bottom for the home key is slightly bigger so you have some room to fit it properly  the only item not provided in the product was a little plastic credit card like apparatus to smooth out the bubbles  i have seen that in almost every other screen protector kit i ve purchased  i just used my fingernail to remove bubbles and it was fine  shipping and packaging were quick  easy and hassle free  all in all  i d say this was a good purchase  definitely recommend this kit for anyone looking for superior screen protection 
haters gonna hate  but this is a quality piece 
the reviews on this seem strange to me  some people had gripes about quality or ease of assembly  they are all wrong  the quality is excellent  it was very easy to put together  it works great  this is a beautiful addition to any bedroom and something that will make the well dressed man very happy 
ismooth screen protector works as promised
product arrived a few days earlier than promised  i live in honolulu so that was a pleasant surprise  for my last two smartphones i ve been using the ismooth brand and have never been disappointed  the fit is perfect and installation is pretty easy compared to a few others i have tried  the screen is self healing which means that tiny air bubbles left after your installation eventually disappear  so be patient  the screen does not affect the sensitivity or visibility of your smartphone screen at all  there is no unwanted glare and the surface feels pretty much the same as the original glass  ismooth is highly recommended 
this is the one
i am terrible at putting on screen protectors   no patience  hand tremors  etc  but the instructions on the video   and watch the video    were easy to understand and helpful  so i girded myself  made sure i had a clean  well lit environment  and followed the instructions to the letter   and voila  an absolutely perfect  bubble free  dust free screen protector for my galaxy s5  i love that it comes with three protectors  saving those just in case   dust stickers to pick up any stray particles  and the cleaning cloth was truly lint free  i have never experienced an easier to install  clearer  more perfect screen protector 
four stars
i used it for the first time last night  it worked great  i did use a cookie sheet to transport it to the oven as others suggested  that worked really well because being silicone it is flimsy not having any body to it  it was no problem  spills cleaned up very easily  i m very happy with it and it is my first time using silicone for baking 
great screen protector
this screen protector was fairly easy to install  the directions were very clear and easy to follow  i did have to throw away one protector but that is fine because i got it perfect the second time around  in the past someone else has always put on my screen protectors for me  so being that i only messed up once is not a bad thing  the protector is very clear and does not reduce the sensitivity of my galaxy s5 in the least nor distorts the image  i loved the extra s that came with the kit  especially the cleaning cloth  i highly recommend  this is a good buy for the price  i have had this protector on for about 3 weeks now and still no problems 
recommend this fine product
ordered about one month ago  used once in moderate rain storm at chihuly museum and garden in seattle  open close just fine  seem very well constructed  perfect  
instruction makes the difference
i have used multiple screen protectors over the past 5 years since i began owning a smartphone  i always ended up with a bubble or dust under my protector and just was at peace with it as this is how it is  i bought ismooth galaxy s5 protector because the price was right and it came with 3 protectors  my husband also needs a protector for his new phone  so this was a good deal  now  i ve seen protectors with the 2 tabs and had some come with a microfiber cloth  but this product goes the extra mile by having a simple and tip filled you tube video for application  the video made a world of difference in me applying the protector  i was always too gentle with it and didn t move it once applied  now  i knew i could lift it up get a dust remover sticker in there and get the surface perfect  i really appreciate ismooth being so incredibly thorough and setting me up for success  i highly recommend this product 
would recommend to a friend 
i bought this for my friend s phone  messed it up while putting on the first one  my fault  was rushing   fortunately ismooth provides three in each box  so was able to throw it out and try again  second one went on easy as pie  included in the box with the three screen protectors is a microfiber cloth and a pack of stickers they call dust removers  i feel that i end up messing things up more with the dust stickers  but careful and repeated cleaning with the microfiber cloth and then putting the screen protector in a low dust environment seems to work perfectly  i have bought these for every phone i ve owned  and would recommend it as a low cost but effective screen protector 
well built umbrella
this is a great travel umbrella  i quite enjoy at how fast it shoots open with the press of a button  held up nicely in the rain wind storm we had a few days back  it closes up nicely and doesn t take up much space at all 
this umbrella is so sturdy and the water drops right off
this umbrella is so sturdy and the water drops right off  it s not like cheap umbrellas where the water drops on your clothes and wet you up  not this one and if it breaks i will be buying another one  money well spent 
perfect

the best screen protector product 
i don t typically write reviews for products i purchase  in fact this may be the first i have done here on amazon  i have been purchasing screen protectors for several years and for at least 10 different applications and this is the best screen protector product i have used yet  i purchased 2 different products this time for 2 new samsung galaxy s5 cell phones  not being familiar with either one yet  i had no preference on which i would try first  unfortunately i tried the other product first on my wife s new cell phone and it took nearly 30 minutes before i got one on correctly  as i said  this is not the first time i have done this so it should not have taken this long  even with me being as picky as i am and wanting it as perfect as possible  having finished with her cell phone i opened the package for the ismooth screen protector and read through the directions as i usually do  just as i did with the other product  after taking so long with the first cell phone i was not looking forward to doing mine next  i cleaned the cell phone screen as directed and used the sticker to remove any extra dust  i began placing the ismooth screen protector and within 2 minutes i was finished  it went on smoothly and nearly effortlessly with no extra air bubbles to  push  out  i could not believe it and thought about taking the other product back off my wife s cell phone and replacing it with the ismooth   i thought about it but did not as i figure we can leave that one on until it needs to be replaced  i will then use one of the spare ismooth screen protectors left over and put it on hers  i am going to see what other applications they will work on and probably get some for whatever else i have lying around  i recommend these ismooth screen protectors with no reservation at all 
nice and handy umbrella
it comes with a nice box  very handy and solid windproof umbrella for every rainy day  it s a nice size for one person  very convenient to carry within a bag  satisfied with my purchase 
5 star product
i am admittedly horrible at putting on screen protectors  i usually have my husband do it  this one was very easy  and went on really smooth  no air bubbles  in fact  my husband picked up my phone  looked at it  and said   do you want me to put that screen protector on for you  oh wow  i couldn t even tell it was on   it doesn t feel or look cheap and plasticy  like other brands i have tried  my husband even bought some for his phone  i will be sticking with this brand 
works great
if you ve ever used a screen protector  this will be exactly what you expect  maybe even a little better than expectations as i managed not to have any of those bubbles i ve gotten from other screen protectors  they are a little tricky to put on but that s just the nature of the product  clean the screen very well and when pulling off tab 2  do so gently so you don t pull off the whole thing from the phone  the home button cutout is slightly larger than the actual button so you don t have to be perfect  just take your time  read the instructions  and you should have your screen protector on in just a few minutes 
great screen protector
i ordered this screen protector because of its rating and am not disappointed  comes with 3 screen protectors  a huge cloth and stickers to clean lint and dust off before applying the screen protector  the microfiber cloth worked great  i don t know if it was the size or the quality but this is the first time i haven t had to remove dust from my screen after wiping it down  the protector itself fits perfect  it leaves about a 1 mm space between the edges and the phones bezel  i can barely tell i have it on when looking at the edges  the gap between the protector and the home button is about 2 mm and the top right where the camera and sensors are are not protected as with all screen protectors  after more than a week it seems very durable  i have a lot of light scratches on the protector that aren t visible when the screen is on but i work in construction so there is no way around that  overall this screen protector is just as good if not better than any i ve tried that are more expensive and way better than the cheaper ones  highly recommended 
best screen protector i have ever purchased
when we ordered our new galaxy s5s  we immediately hopped on amazon to find new screen protectors  the ismooth hd stuck out and we went with them  and could not be happier  they went on both phones with little difficulty  and the few dust particles that got stuck underneath were easily removed by the dust stickers  i don t know why more companies add these stickers in  they literally made this the most flawless screen protector i ve ever had on a phone  and when they say hd  they aren t kidding  no color saturation or breakage  the screen is 100  clear as if the protector wasn t even there  would highly recommend this product to anyone with an s5  it works and looks perfect 
smooth application and crystal clarity
i normally don t write reviews for products due to lack of time  but in since i have the time today  i figured i might as well leave some feedback  the item arrived in a package just like any other half way decent screen protector pack  not to say it was shabby but its not really something to comment much on  the contents included 3 screen protectors  a couple of dust remover stickers and an extra large high quality cleaning cloth  the cleaning cloth is a very nice add on  its almost twice the size of the phone  and is not the cheap kind  but very good quality  i am gonna keep that for cleaning my glasses from now one  the protectors are of very good quality and crystal clear  and easy to install  for someone like me who has very unsteady hands  i was able to successfully install the protector without any bubbles or dust particles i applied it incorrectly the first time and got some dust particles on  and ended up throwing away the protector  not the stickers fault  but my unsteady hands  the second one also got some dust particles but i was able to use the provided stickers to remove and reaplly and now no one can even tell if i even have a protector on  on the whole a very good product  highly recommended 
excellent product
this is an excellent screen protector  fits perfectly and goes on easy with no problems  i went to their website listed on the packaging to watch the installation video  i put my screen protector on in the bathroom after taking a hot shower  i used the microfiber cloth provided to clean the screen and then i peeled back the top half of side 1 and aligned the screen protector then peeled off side 1 completely  i got out any air bubbles with ease and then peeled off side 2  the screen looks great with the screen protector  the kit came with 3 screen protectors  a large microfiber cloth  4 dust removal stickers  and installation instructions card  quality is worth paying for to me but it is great when you can find a high quality product like this for a great price also  i would definitely recommend buying this product 
great screen protector with even better customer service
this is the second device that i have bought the ismooth screen protector for and i have been very pleased with both experiences  my first phone that i used these screen protectors on was my sg3 and now i just upgraded to the sg5  in both cases the protector went on easily when following instuctions  i work in a chemically tough enviroment and on my sg3 about every 5 months i would have to install a new protector  when i used all three that came with my order  i called ismooth and within a few days i had a complete replacement set sent to me free of charge with their lifetime warranty  i was very impressed with this  even though there was no manufacturing defect that caused the screen protector to need to be replaced they still honored the lifetime warranty  that is why when i got my new phone i didn t look for any other screen protectors other than ismooth  i am sure there are other good companies with good products  in my opionion the company that stands behind their product is the one i want to spend my money on 
these muffin pans are great  not only for muffins but for mini egg    
these muffin pans are great  not only for muffins but for mini egg quiches  i bake up a dozen eggs at a time with favorite trimmings for an excellent source of protein and a tasty breakfast  the best part is the easy to no clean up  nothing burned or stuck on  they just pop right out 
easy as pie 
so easy to put on  make sure you watch the youtube video  it really makes it easy  i turned on the shower for 10 minutes then went in and put the screen protector on in 5 minutes  there were a couple bubbles but they took seconds to get out  the really underrated aspect of this is the microfiber cloth they give you  the cloth really cleans the screen well and i used it to easily remove bubbles  screen feels fine with the protector  great buy and i will buy from ismooth again 
great umbrella  worked for my golf trip
i purchased this for my golf trip  i needed something small but effective  this was even lighter than i anticipated  great umbrella
invisible and easy to install
this is the first screen protector that i actually had little to no problems with  it exceeded by expectations  i was looking for a screen protector for my new s5  this ismooth screen protector was easy to apply and the directions were easy to understand  packaging of the product was simple and frustration free  overall i am very happy with this product so i am giving it 5 5 stars  i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a screen protector 
ismooth screen protector galaxy s5
i have had other screen protectors that used the spray to help put the screen in place   cost 3 times what the ismooth costs  for me ismooth was a better option price and quality wise  i had got the ismooth protector for my gs3 originally so when i got my gs5 i knew i was going to go with ismooth again  the hd version works best for me it s crystal clear and my friends were impressed with it s clarity  they have cheap screen protectors that make there screen look dull  it s the easiest screen to put on without a spray which can get messy  if you find this screen protector to hard to put on then a smartphone is to complicated for you to operate 
like most of the other reviews
like most of the other reviews  this screen protector is spot on  i have the galaxy s5 and it fits as should  comes with 3 protectors  cleaning cloth and dust stickers  when putting the screen protector on i could tell this was made of good quality  so far i have no bubbles and the protector is holding up very well  i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality screen protector 
easy installation
amazing  this is the first screen protector i have ever used that got installed perfectly on the first try  i watched the video  followed those instructions  and it fit perfectly and left just a few small bubbles  which went away easily after wiping with the included cleaning cloth  i can t even notice that it s on  the screen looks as brilliant as it did without it 
probably the best screen protector i ve ever bought 
so  just so you know upfront  i am not one of those sketchy review writers for this product  i bought this screen protector about a week and a half ago and have been using it for the last week  i can tell you that to me  this is probably the best protector i ve ever bought off of amazon  it doesn t scratch easily like all those other one cent protectors you see  it was easy as heck to put on  and it doesn t affect the screen at all  which is good because the s5 has a beautiful screen  i don t know what more i can say other than  if you re looking for a good protector at a good price  you will definitely be happy with this one  stop thinking about it and buy it

it s been awhile since i ve had a decent screen protector   
and this one has reminded me what i ve been missing  it was really easy to install and feels just as smooth as the glass  i am notoriously bad at installing screen protectors  and usually opt to have someone more talented than me do it  i managed to put this one on without any bubbles or trapped lint  i found the videos on their website to be extremely helpful and i especially loved the giant cleaning cloth  most kits come with teeny tiny cloths that do nothing  this one did a fantastic job  and they even included sticky tabs to get up anything the cloth missed  i also found them extremely helpful for repositioning the screen protector  because apparently i suck at lining them up properly  my only complaint is the tabs that you use to pull back are at the top  but i found it easier to align position the screen protector from the bottom of my s5  using the button as a guide rather than the top  putting a clear protector on a phone with white trim makes it nearly impossible to align from the top 
one word   simple   
i ve purchased various screen protectors over the years  for iphones  droids  ipads   but this is the first time i have bought one from i smooth  for 3 galaxy s5 in the family   first  delivery was on time   arrived at the original estimated date  no issues  second  just a quality product  didn t appear flimsy  arrived in good condition  did not have any kinks  bends  folds  etc like others have in the past  the product included everything needed including a cleaning cloth and dust removing stickers  third  very very easy to install  i admit  i didn t watch the video  but was very intuitive to follow  but best of all  because of the quality design  it was easy to install  no bubbles the very first time  clung on very easily  completed 2 phones within 15 minutes  never recall installing one of these being this straighforward  very highly recommended product  
best screen protector
installation of this screen protector was as expected  it takes time and patience but if you follow the instruction and tips from the videos you should have a perfect install like i have  after only couple days so far on my galaxy s5 the screen protector looks awesome and you can t even tell it s there  it doesn t alter the clarity of the view any  it s cut perfectly so it doesn t get in the way of my spigen tough armor case either  i m very pleased
but makes great muffins  i have no problem getting muffins out    
i bought this silicone muffin pan to replace an old metal pan  it s a bit smaller  but makes great muffins  i have no problem getting muffins out of the pan  you just have to let them cool and they pop right out  i put this in the dishwasher with no problems and the next batch of muffins still comes out easily
