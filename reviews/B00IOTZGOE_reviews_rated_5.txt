excellent so far
arrived two and half weeks ahead of schedule  and was well packaged  within 30 minutes computer was up and running  monitor  keyboard and mouse appear to be brand new  the only thing we ve found wrong is a tiny foot missing from the bottom of the computer housing which made it rock a little bit  a tiny piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again 
great value for the price  
received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi capability  using this computer for our malting business  as we didn t need anything fancy  will post video review in the future 
five stars

this was a very nice computer    it was refurbished but was practically brand new   came with new wireless keyboard  speakers  and mouse   
great buy and service
i am so pleased with my desktop computer  i tried using the newer  smaller types but they just did not fill my expectations  i am in 2 classes a week  one i am a participant  the other i teach  i needed a computer that i could depend on  thank you for this amazing computer that meets my needs  bob s girl
    made me extremely nervous but the price was too good to pass up
so the reviews made me extremely nervous but the price was too good to pass up  i received and installed it today and everything is good so far  im using it for school and my work from home job and it meets all my work performance needed  items look in good condition and they are all dell products   mouse  monitor  etc   had all pieces and it was super easy like 5 10 minutes to set up and i am by far not a techy person  only hiccup is i thought i had a faulty mouse because the pointer thing wouldnt move but it worked once i finished setup   i used the tab and enter key to complete setup without my mouse functioning  overall i am pleased and i will update if an issue occurs
great computer for the price 
works super quick and can t beat the price  bought it to replace the ten year old mac that is slow and gives the color wheel of death way too much  set them up side by side to use them both 
great and affordable 
so far so good  came with excellent products that had minor use  i like the company i ordered from  linked pc inc  because they included all necessary products to make sure it runs smoothly as soon as i open the box  they also shipped the product in 1 day and received it in less than 5 days including the weekend  overall satisfied with the product as of now 
excellent computer and great customer s service 
excellent computer  and the seller is honest and very friendly  the best in the business  i am very satisfied  the seller replaced my computers twice free of charge  and gave a new one  beautiful  buy from him  i am very satisfied 
this is a great computer for his needs
bought this computer for my 8 year old grandson  that needed one to do his school work and to access websites  this is a great computer for his needs  easy to set up and everything was like new or new  came packaged well and was everything it said it was  nice computer for my grandsons needs 
they quick to respond to my concerns and questions and all information was included on the computer for easy access and setting
blair technologies was veryhelpful in helping correct my order and ensuring the computer fit my needs  they quick to respond to my concerns and questions and all information was included on the computer for easy access and setting up my windows and microsoft programs  i recommend blair technologies for all computer needs 
it s a great computer
i m just getting used to the new computer  every day i learn something new  it s a great computer  i love it 
nice computer  physically it looks new
nice computer  physically it looks new  no cosmetic defects  the 19  screen is great  i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original product key  x ed out  i would have thought the computer was new  the only surprise was wifi adapter had to be purchased separately for the one i bought   i must have missed that when i ordered it  other than that oversight  it is great 
great for my aging eyes
this monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my own home  the windows product key didn t work when i tried entering at the initial set up  but the 2nd time that i tried it it registered correctly without any problems  not sure what the glitch was with that  but i am loving this cost effective set up 
so glad that i found you
so glad that i found you  details written said plug in ready  i did not have to spend hours with internet tech to set up  you guys rock  this is definitely anyone s one stop shop for future needs  thank you

good working computer 
so far very pleased with this machine
so far very pleased with this machine  it isnt super fast but it works great for a machine in my shop to run a cnc mill and plasma cutter or just to look up parts for the farm 
very happy with my purchase 
my old computer was 8 years old  i know   outdated  i didn t want to spend a fortune on a new one  this refurbished one is great  does what i need it to do and more  it cost me what a new monitor would cost  so fast now  the keyboard and mouse were brand new  the monitor was used tho but in great condition   since my own monitor was less than a year old  i use the one that came with the package deal on my security cameras  it works great on them  i am very happy with my purchase 
amazing value
i am not a techy person but this computer looks good  the screen seems enormous and very clear  it seems to do everything my daughter wants it to do  she s 13   you know i m going to be hearing about it if it doesn t     really just amazing for the price  the only thing it didn t do was connect wirelessly to the internet but that was quickly and cheaply resolved with one email that the seller responded to rapidly 
works excellent  and has everything you need for a basic    
a bargain  works excellent  and has everything you need for a basic computer for simple tasks such as browsing the internet  playing music  watching movies  etc  i have had no problems what so ever with this computer
