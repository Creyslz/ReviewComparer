nice shelves but instructions are lacking
update  in the attached picture  the hairbrush and watch is attached to the shelve unit by command hooks  they are not included in the shelving unit  these were very well packaged  received with no damage and very fast shipping time  that said  the installation of these is not difficult but first thing you need to do is throw out the instructions  just make sure you have the 6 screws that came in the package  if you need to use anchors to attach to the wall  throw out the ones you received and go to a home improvement store and purchase better one  the ones you receive are cheap and break very easy  the measurement of each shelve   from inside to inside of side pieces   15 5 8  11 3 4  and 7 3 5  each of these are 4  deep  i put mine up on the wall and put a small line on the wall where i wanted the top side rail to be at then measured to top of the screw hole  3 4    and put a mark 3 4  down from the small line  used a cordless drill to put the screws in  do not make them flush to the wall as you will need to put them in the big hole on the back of the shelve then push the shelve down  i put up the longest shelve first then used that for where i wanted my other ones to be positioned on the wall  i have never installed this type of shelving before but once i disregarded the instructions  they went up on the wall pretty quick  i gave it four stars because of the cheap anchors and the lack of instructions 
good shelves  but sub par hardware and unusable directions
for the money  these are good little shelves  the miters are less than perfect  but they re a good value   i feel satisfied in that regard  here s where i had a problem   the plastic drywall anchors are total garbage  if you drill a hole small enough to hold them securely  then they ll collapse upon your attempt to insert them  if you drill the hole big enough to be able to install them without damaging them beyond use  then they ll just spin and come loose when you try to screw anything into them  the cost of better anchors would  probably  be measured in micro pennies  why they didn t just include better anchors is a mystery  after making a mess and filling in the original holes and re plotting the whole affair  i grabbed some of my own anchors and screws and everything went without a hitch  i used 1 4    8 anchors and screws  see picture   finally  an installation tip   when setting the screws into the anchors  tighten the screw completely  not too tight   about two total rotations after hitting the anchor flange  to draw the plastic flange flush with the wall and  though we can t see it happening  to spread the back part of the drywall anchor  then  back the screw out about a quarter inch for final shelf installation  this will enable the shelf to sit flush against the wall  provide additional grab for the anchors  and minimize wobble  the directions that come with these shelves are pretty awful  and necessitated a bit of trial and error on my part  i m not a carpenter  by any means  but i m not a dope  either  in short   good shelves  but use your own drywall anchors and matching screws 
suits my needs 
these are small lightweight shelfs that i used for my son s room to display his plushies  i was tired of him  storing  them on the floor  they needed a home so i have been eyeing various shelves on amazon  saw these  read the reviews and decided to give these a shot  the instructions are pretty self explanatory  i liked that this kit included paper stencils so you visualize the shelving placement configuration and know where to drill the holes to place the screws for the shelves  the anchors are pretty crappy  one of them completely broke into the wall when i went to screw the screw in  luckily i had some anchors on hand and simply replaced it  installation was simple and straightforward  the shelves look very nice  so much so i ordered a second pair in white that i plan to install in my bathroom  i m very satisfied with this purchase  my son likes his things being out of the way and on display as well 
overall great  and look nice
overall great  and look nice  and are a great fit size for funko pop figurines  which is why we went with these in the first place   the only real issue i have is that the instructions don t  far as i remember  advise you on what size drill to use in order for the anchors to fit  maybe that s something other people can intuit immediately  but i can t  it was a bit of trial and error  and because of the  soft  quality of the anchors included in the pack  the first one i put in the wall ended up mashed in  sticking out  and as a result making the respective shelf tilt forward a bit  i figured out the right drill size after the first mishap  otherwise  these are fairly easy to install  and we re happy with them  definitely using better quality anchors if and when we have to move the shelves though  for reinstalling 
nice display shelves
purchased these shelves for a home office because the finish matched my existing desk perfectly and the price was right  love the contemporary look of the shelves  the installation packet came with a template for each shelf to hang the mounting screws which made installation so easy  the only negative was that one of the shelves was a bit scratched up the on underside  not very noticeable and once i had it hung up you could not tell at all so i did not bother returning it  i do wish they have made them reversible for hanging so that you had more options but they look great anyways 
fresh finish shelves
love these shelves  made our bathroom look great  and also gave us more storage  and gave the bathroom a fresh finished look  i only have to take on star off because sometimes the screws that were given with the product did not fit the holes exactly on the floating shelves  so my husband had to get different nails to make it work  all in all though this is a great purchase  thank you 
great shelves  terrible hardware
this is the 4th set i have bought  great shelves  but heads up on hardware  i was able to use original hardware before  hanging over doors in laundry room  however today  was putting in a spot where it turns out it hit a stud  prepped as usual  i ve seen people had trouble with the anchors  but my screw just twisted in half in the stud  soooo  get your own anchors and screws  shelves are beautiful and sturdy  no issues there
look good
good shelves  they are made of particle board  which is a lot better than plastic  very easy to install  comes with a template to make putting on wall easier  i would suggest tossing the wall anchors that come with them in the trash  go to the hardware store and get good ones  this will save you a lot of time putting them up  i put mine into drywall and they just slipped around  a major headache  i will probably buy these again if i need some and a good pack of wall anchors 
great product but runs small     
looks simple and beautiful on wall giving it an expensive look   hanging them was simple n easy which took five minutes as all the necessary hardware is included along with the package   as i ordered walnut finish the color contrasts perfectly with the wall giving it an elegant look   the reason for a four star is it s size  which runs small   i excepted them to be much bigger   overall great product for the price  
simple shelves that can provide character to a bare wall 
i purchased these for a bathroom wall simply to give it a little character  like many have stated  the dry wall anchors that are provided are very weak  not a big issue but i recommend purchasing different ones  got a pack at wal mart for  2   if what youre placing on the shelves will be very light  you can probably get away their anchors but better to play it safe  i handled the shelves quite a bit while installing them and they never chipped or showed signs of tear  when you choosing the height of where you will drill your pilot holes  keep in mind that the shelves will slide down about an inch to lock in place  if it wasnt for poor quality anchors  it would have been 5 stars 
make sure to use your own hardware 
i agree with most reviewers on not using the provided hardware  while the shelving looks great  once i used my own screws and ignored the drywall anchors that nearly fell apart getting them out of the bag  i would have been screwed  pun intended  if i didn t have my own screws  and while i thought the paper guide with the stickers literally marked  stickers  were goofy it actually ended up coming in handy for measuring out where i needed to place the screws for each shelf 
nice shelves
nice shelves for the price  i did purchase heavy duty dry wall anchors at lowes for under  2 because the ones that came with the shelves seemed cheap  i also added command hooks on the side for my necklaces and hair ties and my bathroom vanity looks so much better without all that clutter 
nice shelves
my brother put these shelves up for me  his one complaint  the hardware that came with the shelves   useless  was the word he used  he didn t care for the template  provided  either  i had some extra screws and anchors  so he was able to get them up  overall  i do like them 
not perfect but pretty close 
these shelves were packaged very nicely and came very quickly  they aren t  blow your mind  good quality  they lamenent isn t perfect around some of the coners  however  it s hardly noticible the shelves them selves have a sturdy build  are very easy to install  and are study on the wall  the only thing i noticed and was like  what the heck   was that the shelves  i got white  seemed dirty  it wasn t a huge deal  the smudges wiped right off but it was still weird  over all i m quite pleased and i probably will repurchase 
beautiful but bad directions and don t use the plastic piece   
i love these shelves now that they re up but the instructions and those little white plastic things are terrible  it s nice that they give you paper that has the shelf sizes to screw through  it allowed me to level the paper and then drill in the right spots 
nice shelves  good price 
these are cute and inexpensive shelves for small  lightweight items  we bought them to display our miniature lighthouse collection and they work fine for this  i gave the product only 4 stars because the anchors that came with the shelves were garbage and i opted to use my own 
shelves are great  the screws are garbage 
the shelves are perfect and awesome  and i love them  however  the screws that came with them are absolute trash  for force purposes  i used both a screwdriver and a drill  yet the tips still broke   you re better off buying some quality screws to ensure that they don t break while trying to install these wonderful shelves 
nice shelves
for the price  they re nice shelves  installation was easy and they provide you with measuring guides to make sure they re straight and aligned properly  however  i think the plastic screw anchors are pretty shoddy and would recommend buying your own 
i actually would have preffered them without the upright parts
i was looking for little shelves without the upright parts but once i got these  i found out that i could use the space to add to the machine age retro look that the little stirling engine on top has 
good shelves  a little difficult to install
nice  as advertised  really neat 3 set of shelves  i had some difficulty installing but nothing too terrible  i ended up using bigger anchors that worked nicely  currently using the shelves to hold scrapbooking silhouette materials and i ve had no problems
