it keeps me cool in the sun and safe in the rain
this is an ultra lightweight  6 4 oz  and compact umbrella  it fits perfectly in my bag because it is small  this umbrella is able to block 95  uv ray and protects me well from the heating sun and any expected downpours  it keeps me cool in the sun and safe in the rain  it is so convenient and it is a great present to anyone  it has a stylish look also  it is sturdy and smooth  it is made of six rib aluminum alloy  it is easy to open and close without much strength needed  the velcro strap keeps it closed nicely  furthermore  it is wind resistant and waterproof that makes it dry quickly  great customer service 
works in a pinch
this umbrella is a good size for a pocket travel umbrella  it is smaller than a usual travel umbrella  but provides adequate coverage  i used this recently during a rain storm and it did keep me dry  it is not automatic  so there is no button and you will need to push it up and pull it down yourself  it was a little stiff at first  but became more flexible after the first use  my main complaint about this is that it takes a bit longer to fold and strap down  i was never able to fit the cover back over it  but that is okay  overall it is a nice little umbrella that will work in a pinch 
nice and compact  just what i wanted 
i like that this umbrella is very small and compact  i have a hard time getting it packed exactly back up the way it was upon arrival but it still gets small and goes right back into the sleeve that came with it  the wrist strap is too small for my hand but it fits in my purse so nicely that i cant be upset about the strap  it rained for a few days this week and even though this umbrella is small  it was still large enough to keep me dry  im thinking about purchasing a second one to keep in my sons backpack  this umbrella is perfectly fine for an adult but they a flawlessly perfect for a child 
compact and cute  but would be better if it had an auto open function 
the umbrella is honestly on of the tiniest and most portable ones on the market  not to mention the design is very cute  it can easily shield one person from the rain  but dont expect to shield two  i realize that the umbrella doesnt state that it has an auto open function  but if it did  this umbrella would undoubtedly be the one  because who wants to fiddle with opening an umbrella in this day and age 
protected for rain or sun
the day i got this compact portable umbrella it started raining  i was so happy that it came in right when i was going off  it is designed to open and close without a button so at first i thought it was broken  now i like that it works the way it does  it folds up and is small enough to keep in my backpack  the construction seems to be durable  the reason i gave this umbrella a 4 instead of a 5 is because i cannot get it back in the bag  the bag needs to be able to stretch a little so it is easier to place it back  i do love the colors i got 
it is very light and small  however  i    
it is very light and small  however  i just got it and find it hard to open   it seems stiff  i m hoping it will loosen up with use  update  it still seemed stiff after some time so fidus generously offered to replace the umbrella or refund my purchase price  as i had already replaced the umbrella elsewhere  i happily accepted their offer for a refund 
it is very light weight and compact which is perfect for his little hands
i got this umbrella to use with my toddler on rainy days when we go out to splash in puddles  it is very light weight and compact which is perfect for his little hands  opening it was very easy  as for closing you have to do it yourself  there is no nun to push down  it was quite easy to do by just pulling it down  i like that this is smaller so we can throw it in a coat pocket if we dont need to use it  overall happy toddler happy mommy
the length is about size of my palm and you can easily carry in your purse or backpack
compact and lightweight umbrella  the length is about size of my palm and you can easily carry in your purse or backpack  the size is good for an average size person but might not be big enough for bigger guys  im not sure how its gonna hold up the wind due to its lightweight  its not that windy here in texas so i really cant say  its fairly easy to open but sometimes takes me a few tries to close it up  overall good umbrella for the price if youre looking for something to carry around all the time 
too cute 
i got the pink and white polka dot  seriously too cute  i actually bought this to take to baseball games to keep the sun off of me  i love the nice compact size  easy to toss in my baseball bag  it s small  which is perfect for using just for me  and wont block the view of the people behind me  not the sturdiest i ve ever bought  but it works just fine  and did i say cute  i love the material 
was disappointed  saved by customer service 
the umbrella was smaller than listed in the details  also  the umbrella was incredibly flimsy and did not stand up to the slightest amount of wind  i originally bought this to keep in my backpack  but its not even big enough to cover me and half of my backpack  incredibly disappointed in this purchase  i wish i could get a full refund  update  i chanced to 4 stars because of excellent customer service  customer service reached out and offered me a full refund  they are such a kind company to work with  just because of my negative experience  i hope other customers will genuinely enjoy this product 
small   light umbrella to carry
i just received this today and since its a rainy day today  the timing is just perfect  this umbrella is small so its really easy to be kept in a womans purse  it is evan small enough to fit in the jeans back pocket  it is also very light  another great feature  it opens up to become a regular size umbrella and can be opened and closed easily  this is a great handy umbrella 
great for small people or kids
this is a very small umbrella  not meant for everyday use in my opinion  because it is a mini umbrella the handle of it is very short  my hand at the bottom of it only goes to about my shoulders when in use  the actual handle comes off easily as it does unscrew  it has nice fabric  closes up nicely back into the sleeve  this would be great for a kid  or a small person 
beautiful and perfect size to fit in a purse or backpack 
this is a very nice umbrella  it s much smaller than i thought  i mean it s super compact when closed which is awesome and what i expected but i meant when it s open the pole is shorter than i was expecting  i m a bigger person so it s not super practical for me   but it s perfect for my 5 year old daughter   which worked out since her toddler umbrella just broke  she now is excited to have a  big girl  umbrella  the circumference is a good size  pretty standard average size   the colors for the flower on the inside are super vibrant and beautiful 
so tiny 
this umbrella is of the perfect size for me to pack in my mission trip suitcase  i tend to go to tropical locations with heavy raining  and this is so little that i can fit it in my backpack  better than a poncho 
lightweight  compact
it s a very small size  handheld for sure  i got this for my husband because if the umbrella is too bulky he won t take it with him  the canopy of course is also relatively small  so good for a shower  but maybe not so good for some of our florida rain  it s easy to open and close and even easier to store  as well as lightweight 
great little umbrella
great little umbrella  i have only used it a few times and only in light to moderate rainfall without heavy wind  but so far it has worked well  it is small enough that i have no problem fitting it into my crossbody bag  the reason for 4 stars is that it is a little difficult to open completely with ease  i feel that if i open it too quickly it might break  i do not want to test it   
blocks uv rays 
i was looking for a nice umbrella to use this coming spring and summer  i chose this one because it was so pretty and also blocks harmful uv rays  the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a little difficult to open the first time  after i opened and closed it a couple times  it was much easier 
good quality umbrella
received today and already needed to use it  it functions like a regular umbrella and has a nice silicone wrap around strap to secure when closed  i am very happy about the strap not being one of the cheap velcro type  the design  flower  is only visible from underneath the umbrella and is all black on top  but this does not effect the way it works 
the umbrella comes in a small pouch its small but sturdy   have not used it in high windy    
got this to have in the car  small and compact   the umbrella comes in a small pouch its small but sturdy   have not used it in high windy situations as of yet  but will update once i do  i have a feeling itll hold up well  overall its a nice looking umbrella that feels sturdy enough to last quite sometime 
it s always good to have a spare umbrella in my bag
it s always good to have a spare umbrella in my bag  this one is small and light enough to fit in the smaller areas of my backpack  the fact that it is so lightweight makes it perfect because i never know when i ll need it and i know i will always have one on me at all times  would recommend 
like it   
i received this umbrella  and i really like the look of it  its compact and they do mean compact  only one person can hold underneath it  i do like that it seems like its made out of a type of plastic material and not cloth like  nicely made and the inside designis pleasing to the  
i m sure glad i had this today
i m sure glad i had this today  it has rained all day and this little umbrella is really handy to carry in my purse  it does take a few seconds to deploy and retract because it doesn t have a button to push to release it  it is just as beautiful as pictured 
rubber vs nylon 
it s a rubbery type material that i ve never seen before for an umbrella  works and looks great but i deducted a star because the different material is a little harder to wrap up to put away  overall i like it
