after blended a drink bottom of the blender leaves black marks or dirts on ur table 
hi there i just got this item from you and its working fine  but there is small issue every time when i blended some drinks underneath of blender came out black color dirts and hard to clean it i dont know what that was but looks like came out from blender cooling hole could you explain to me what it was   i had to put a fabric under 
i would give this product 4 stars  but it    
i would give this product 4 stars  but it is hard to remove the gasket from the blade base so you can clean it  using a butter knife  i get as far down the side of the gasket as i can  then i lift the gasket up until i can grab it  that is the only flaw to the nutri ninja 
out with the bullet  in with the ninja
i bought this when my beloved nutribullet refused to release the cup  i had the bullet for about 8 months and i loved it despite the glitches   like occasionally having to go to war just to get the thing open  or realizing your smoothie is all over your walls even though you didn t over fill it  but the bullet is sturdy  a bit heavy and it does a wonderful job blending veggies  ice  frozen fruit  seeds and powders into a lovely  smooth consistency  after nearly dislocating my shoulder after 3 days of trying to get the bullet to release my drink and the drink has turned into zombie barf  i gave up and the entire thing is in the trash  enter the ninja  first impression  it s much lighter than the bullet and looks chintzy  it does not have the suction cups on the bottom which were a wonderful touch on the bullet and you have to hold the cup in place in the ninja for the duration of the processing  unlike the bullet  which allows you to walk away during the 30 seconds of processing  the ninja only has 1 processing option   the bullet has 2 the ninja s cups are smaller than the bullet  but fit in car cup holder better  obvious pros are the price is less than the bullet  there is no twisting the cup into place on the processing unit so there is no risk of an accidental crooked twist resulting in a locked cup and a lot of money in the garbage   not to mention no breakfast  the smoothie came out just as smooth ones from the bullet  i also like the cup lid better on the ninja as the rubber stopper on the bullet cups kept coming off  i love my bullet when it worked and would have given it 5 stars if i d written a review 2 hours after opening the box like i m doing for my ninja  but after discovering all the glitches and having to toss it in the trash after less than a year  i d give the bullet no stars check out some of the youtube videos that come up with the search  i can t open my nutribullet    the struggle is real people  get the ninja 
very quick but doesnt completely break down everything 
i bought this as a gift for my wife  she likes to make shakes to bring to work in the morning  she said it is very quick and very strong but sometimes she notices it doesnt completly break everything down and it winds up leaving a few whole bits  overall it works well but i would leave it run for a few more seconds than you think it needs just to be sure everythings broken down 
i put in frozen fruits and it shreds them good  not related to the product but
this thing is powerful  and exretemely loud my floor shakes  it works thought  i use to to make smoothies  i put in frozen fruits and it shreds them good  not related to the product but    originally i bought this and there was some issue of it being delivered and it was suppose to be re delivered but then got lost somewhere     not sure if usps stole this or lost it  i had to reorder a new one  so it basically took a week to receive this  when it was suppose to be 2 day prime 
surprised
i thought i wouldn t like it more than my old nutribullet  but i was surprised that i liked it better  i like that you have to hold down the cup for the unit to operate  since i feel it is safer because you can control the blade action  also  you don t have to worry about a locking mechanism  with the nutribullet the locking mechanism was always jamming  i didn t give it a 5 star rating because the unit was advertised as  like new  and the base as well as the cup came with obvious scratches 
overtighten to avoid leakage 
this is the second time around reviewing this item  the first review was not approved  it figures  however  i gave nutri ninja another shot  and i realized the leaking problem in the lid that i was having while in use  was due to the fact that you have to overtighten the lid for it to work appropriately  otherwise it always leaks  so with that being said  i can deal with that  i like the concept of these personal rocket type of blenders  but i feel the  nutri bullet   due to it s removable blade assembly that has two distinct kind of blades  offers a little bit more versatility  and a finer grinding  so basically  i feel like it would be awesome of ninja gave also that other blade assembly to have better blend on harder things 
little blender that packs quite a punch 
i ve only used this blender a couple of times so far but this little blender packs a punch  it is quite powerful to blend a smoothie right up  i love that you just fill your cup  twist the blade on  click it in place and push down  it is easy for on the go mornings  its great size fits great on the counter so i dont have to drag it out of cupboards everytime i want to use it  so far very glad i purchased this item 
super smoothie blender 
i absolutely love this thing  it s so easy to use and clean  works so fast and makes the perfect smoothie  incredible value for such a high quality appliance  highly recommend  my only complaint is that there are no measurements printed on the cups  that would be a really nice feature but it s not a huge deal 
really does a fast job of blending 
did a ton of reading reviews on this thing before getting it  i really like the size of it and that it comes with 2 different sized containers  it can whip up just about anything in minutes  the cord can be stored underneath  cleanup is really easy by adding a little soap to water and running the blender  only complaint is the noise  it is quite loud  otherwise nice quick and does the job  i can even make hummus in this thing
