better than beats headsets
these are perfectly good headphones and quite economical  i bought them after being frustrated by my second pair of beats over the ear headphones  and a third in ear set of beats  that broke for no good reason  beats are expensive  they dont sound all that much better than these  and they are of insufficient construction quality  so  this pair became my solution and im happy with them  the only thing i miss from the beats is the removable audio cable  the audio cable on these headphones are permanently attached to the headphones  a minor point  but i did like the removable cable on the beats 
very efficient yet amazing deep  varied smooth clean bass with overall excellent    
hard to believe  honestly   11 headphones  very efficient yet amazing deep  varied smooth clean bass with overall excellent pleasant mids and highs  clean quality astounding with dynamic depth   again hard to believe  i am sitting here in awe listening to music on my phone  never sounded so good  the surprising part is i got them for my ham radio rig  thinking they would be ok  never expected what i am hearing as they playback great sounding music from low power device with such efficient volume and solid clean bass  i have spent  100s on headphones of all types  these are incredible for the    wow   
great quality for the price 
i m so surprised by the quality of these headphones given the price  seriously  the audio quality is better than my apple headphones  i ve read a few reviews that say they ve broken the headphones a few weeks after purchase just due to poor material  so i m being extra careful with them and so far so good  i would definitely recommend these  the mic works well with my macbook and iphone  and the actual headphone is a tiny bit smaller than my ear but it s not a huge deal to me  it still fits well  and doesn t hurt me even after three  hours of use  i have yet to use them with my gaming controller  i m curious to see if it would work  but even if it doesn t   still a great pair of headphones for the price  i would purchase again if anything were to happen to my current pair  to be honest  hope this review helps 
wallet is still full and so are my ears 
first off let me say  i wasn t expecting much from a   15 pair of headphones  the plug on my sony pair actually ripped off when my computer fell to the ground so i decided to pull the trigger and buy these  they are compact when folded  the packaging was tiny  and they fit perfectly on my huge noggin  i m no audiophile but i would say the sound is adequate and levels are great  you don t get too much of anything but every level is where it needs to be in every type of media i have pumped through them  if you re looking for super bass  not gonna find it here but the bass translates at a perfect level through the drivers  i would get these if you are looking for a decent pair of headphones and don t want to commit to draining your wallet 
great comfortable headphones at a good price  great sound and build quality
for the price  i ve gone through a small collection of headphones  everything from gaming headsets out to the standard tech store sets  and after one of my old gaming headsets needed to be replaced  it fits comfortably on the ears and has a good bass and sound and folds up quite nicely and compactly  the stainless steel plug and the durable rubber coating on the cord is a nice touch as well  and it s just perfect 
stunning quality 
for the low cost  the sound quality is superb  i ve had headphones seven times more expensive that didn t sound this good  to test noise reduction  i listened to music through these while my family watched a comedy on tv  and the headphones worked excellent over my husband s extremely loud laughter  one brilliant little aspect of these which i ve never seen on other headphones or earbuds is a small spring attached directly above the headphone jack  over the last couple of years  we ve purchased no less than twenty sets of headphones and earbuds  and every one of them have had issues around the headphone jack which causes loss of sound in one ear  hopefully  this will correct that problem  if not  i will update  the only negative  which isn t huge for me but may be for someone else  is the cord length could be longer 
they re fourteen dollars and they are great
i have been wanting headphones for a long time  between my television  tablet  and phone being either dolby 7 1 or 5 1  ear buds just don t cut it  for christmas i treated myself to a pair of high end headphones and love them  i had been using ear buds at the gym and found they were always falling out  i could hear everything going on around me  now  i certainly didn t want to bring the good headphones to the gym  i mean  nothing would happen  but something could happen  i use a kindle fire hd 8 tablet at the gym  just so you can look up the audio specs  the price was right  it seemed like people were happy with this  pros  1  the price  if they break  i am not going to cry  2  one wire  i find that makes exercising easier because you can choose where you want the one wire to lie  3  reasonable noise cancellation  these are not noise cancelling headphones  nor do they make the claim   but thanks to the padding  it eliminates a preponderance of the surrounding noises  the gym has music playing and announcements and i didn t find them distracting at all  contrast that with ear buds where i couldn t listen to my shows well  4  light  i don t find them distracting  i do the treadmill for cardio  so i am standing and bouncing around  i don t feel like a boa constrictor is coiled around my skull or that a bag of flour is atop my head  5  the sound is perfectly reasonable  again  this was a purchase with a specific use  i e  going to the gym  i am not listening to the symphony  i watch tv shows while doing cardio  i am not an engineer  so i can t debate specs with you  but take it from a layperson  these are fine  i used them at home to compare with my hoo hoo headphones and found that bass response is worse and there is a less feeling of three dimensional sound  but this was never expected  if you are demanding exacting standards from headphones which cost less than a movie ticket  you answered your own complaint  6  no one has complained about the quality of the sound when i used the microphone for telephone calls and whatsapp calls and messages  eta  7  the plug is really nice with a sturdy metal construction and a spring around the end to keep it from fraying  cons 1  the padding is covered with pleather  it does get sweaty  this is a minor complaint  but i am accustomed to foam and being able to purchase replacements  2  they cannot be treated in a cavalier manner  they are fourteen dollars  they are not going to survive being thrown around  i wrap mine in a towel in my gym bag until i macguyver some kind of case  assuming i have the gumption to do so  my gut feeling tells me these would break rather easily if thrown around or if they were not packed carefully  they fold nicely into a flattened pattern  see promotional photos   eta  upon closer inspection  they are stronger than i thought  yes  they are all plastic with some chrome accoutrements but it does feel strong  i think these would snap under stress though  the plus side is a little gorilla glue would get you back to work  3  this is a small complaint  but i find the volume adjustment  play  pause a little too high up on the cord  i don t know if this is due to microphone placement  but i wish it were farther down the length of it  i am 6  2  tall  so the controls dangle around shoulder height for me  so  if you are like me and wanted headphones instead of ear buds to use but also wanted  needed a microphone  these are great  if you have little impish children who easily break their toys  this is good for them  the sound is fine  they work fine  just don t be throwing them around or letting them jostle in your duffel bag  i have had them two weeks and used them for twelve trips to the gym  i am quite happy with them  you should be also  they are fourteen bucks 
very comfortable   able to wear for long periods without being    
what a difference  i had the volume turned almost to max to hear clearly with my old headphones  when i plugged this guy in  pow   controls way to the other side leaving lots of room for adjustment  very comfortable   able to wear for long periods without being aware of them  it would be nice if the cord were about a foot longer  though 
clear and consistent sound   highly recommend
i m a little hard of hearing so i use this primarily on my computer so i can watch shows and have the volume up louder than i would normally play the tv  i had another elaborate headphone and found that the voices did not come through clearly at all even at top loud volume  these work great  just bought another set for my grandkids when they listen to cd s here  the sound is great  its clear  and i don t have to have it all that loud to be able to hear well  
very good for the price
the coloring of the headphones was very nice and exactly what my brother wanted  i particularly loved how small the packaging the headphones came in  according to him  the speakers are of great quality  i just might have to buy another pair for myself 
fantastic sound  can t believe these are so low priced 
fantastic sound  a much better  fuller  robust sound than apple earbuds  while these are a tiny bit big for my head  they are very comfortable to wear for long stretches at a time  the microphone is placed fairly well up the left side  but provides good voice quality  the controls are easy to use and cord is high quality   it even has a nice metal plug with metal spring   very upscale 
    for someone else and they were so cushioned and nice sounding that we ordered two more pair
we ordered one pair for someone else and they were so cushioned and nice sounding that we ordered two more pair  love the volume adjust feature and the one sided cord too  great price and great product   thank you 
nice cheap headphones
nice headphones for the price  they seem to be well made and durable  and they are very compact when folded  the only complaints i have are that the ear pads are a little stiff  although this could change with more wear  and that the head band is too big  and i don t exactly have a small head   otherwise excellent for the price 
great sound  compact size
i bought these so i d have a compact set of headphones to travel with  the earbud style just don t work for me on a plane  these were just  14 and they have great sound  especially for the price  what i really like is they fold up to a small size  when folded  they are a little smaller than my hand and they fit in a quart size ziploc with room to spare 
very comfortable and excellent sound quality   and a great bargain
i really like these earphones  they are light weight and are very comfortable  i much prefer them to the uncomfortable earbuds that i used in the past  admittedly  they take up more space than the earbuds  but they are very compact  sound quality is excellent  much better than i was expecting considering the very reasonable price 
needed new headphones
i was in need of some new headphones  because i sat on and broke and had to tape up my old ones  i recently received a  75 amazon gift card  after thinking of what to get  it hit me to purchase some new headphones  they re my favorite color red  the sound and bass is excellent  they seem sturdy   
great sound  sensitive mic
the sound quality is incredible at this price range  i was really impressed with the sound and build of the headphones  the only thing i didn t like was the microphone  which picks up a great amount of outside sound  i tried to record something and can clearly hear myself but also the background noise  if i touch the cord the mic will make a rattling sound  i bought this to make phone calls but for listening to music this is a great product 
he says that these headphones are one of the best wired headphones that he has had
my brother absolutely loves these headphones  i got these for him since he can not use bluetooth headphones  he says that these headphones are one of the best wired headphones that he has had  he enjoys the loud clear sound of the bass and music it put out  he even said that these are almost comparable to beats but way less on the cost  so overall i guess he loves these headphones and kinda makes me want a pair of my own now 
good product
i purchased these phones for use with a ham radio and for this they have been great  i can wear them for prolonged periods of time very comfortably  they also sound great when plugged into a stereo system  for the price  these things sound quite amazing  i m more than happy with them 
for less than  15 
i was totally surprised of the quality of these headphones  seem very durable  use daily  for walking  should be perfect  for my daily routine  sound quality is the best of any i have ever listened to  in my life  honestly  i have never spent  15 for headphones  in my life either  less than  10  but if i didnt know how much they cost  i truly think they would be  50 or more  all metal cord plug with spring cord protector  we accidentally ordered 2  glad we did  less than  15  deserves a six star rating  let you know if anything changes 
best headphones ever    
these headphones are wonderful     the sound is very clear  very good volume control    
great value and quality for the price
i have had these headphones for about 4 weeks now and they are still working great  i am so shocked and surprised at how well they sound and feel  i got them as an extra set of but now use them exclusively over my more expensive ones

comfortable and good quality
works great  my son is using them for his kindle  he says they are comfortable 
comfortable  great amplification  perfect for me as a hearing impaired user
i certainly wasn t expecting much with the price of these earphones but boy  i was wrong  they are very comfortable to wear  the amplification is great  i am hearing impaired and have trouble hearing through some earphones but the sound is loud and clear in these  i had to turn the volume down more than half using them  i had some sony earphones previous to these and i had to turn the volume up all the way to hear through them  as an added bonus  there are volume controls on the cable that plugs into the sound jack
pretty good  on a scale from 1 to 10 
i am no audio expert  these headphone sound good  good clarity  good bass  fold up well  and pretty comfortable  like i said  don t know much  but very happy with the performance for the price 
excellent on ear headphones
excellent on ear headphones  comfortable  the connector has a metal spring on it  so i anticipate that the plug will not break too soon  decent sound for the price  the microphone works fine  no complaints from callers  i use it for my cell and for my computer 
perfect headphones for bte hearing aids
these on ear headphones work great over my behind the ear hearing aids  no feedback and i can still hear conversations thru my hearing aids while wearing headphone  low price makes them prefect for travel where the chance of loss or breakage is greater  i just wish they came with a storage pouch  the single cord is a real plus  i wore them for 3 hours yesterday with no discomfort  i plan on using them with my iphone x and ipad 
five stars
just great
very surprising sound
the headphones have exceptionally good sound quality  if you listen on your computer right click to change your sound quality  it will be phenomenal 
got them as a gift for my niece who complained
