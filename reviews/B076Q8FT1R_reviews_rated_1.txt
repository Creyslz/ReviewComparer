big and heavy
i bought this umbrella based on the many positive reviews here  when i received it  i was appalled to find how big and heavy it was  i did not bother opening the umbrella but returned it  since it doesn t even fit into my handbag  the case that came with it is made of synthetic leather and also adds to the weight  very disappointed overall 
not good
this umbrella flipped inside out the first little wind that blew  i do not recommend this product 
avoid 
not wind resistant in the slightest  can t even stand up to light boston wind  let alone strong winds 
cheaply made and not worth the price  
once i opened the umbrella from the package to see it the metal handle broke from the top of the umbrella cloth   i had to buy a  5 package just to send it back for my refund   worst buy ever
