good for text  horrible for photos and videos   bad contrast levels
the contrast levels are horrible  it s fine for text and spreadsheet work when you have obviously diverse colors and tones  but forget about using this for photos or videos or any significant graphics  i don t regret buying it as i wanted quick and cheap and a resolution to match my notebook  but the five year old display on the notebook blows this one away  i wouldn t buy this monitor again 
this was packaged well and works fine  
this was packaged well and works fine    except  it has some dead transistors  one dead right out of the box  and then another one showed up recently  it s otherwise a fine little monitor  but dead transistors are horrifically distracting  and one expects that not to happen when the monitor is brand new out of the box  and handled with gentleness while being unpacked and set up  it s not enough to go through the bother of packing it back up and returning it  as it s such a big delicate product  but i m having second thoughts about buying a second one for the other computer  if tiny black dots that you can t fix bother you  don t risk it by getting this monitor 
ok monitors 
i bought these monitors based off the many positive reviews i read here at amazon  my monitors arrived and looked great  upon installing them they don t quite sit flush to one another  which isn t my biggest complaint  these two monitors have very different color temperatures and it is sometimes blaringly obvious  this is a bit of a disappointment but for the cost  i ll live with it  this is just as an fyi to those where this might mean something 
you get what you pay for 
your get what you pay for  the monitor is very very dim  at brightness and contrast maxed at 100  it s still dim  if your buying this monitor to use in bright room i d suggest a different one  overall for what it costs it does the job  but when it comes to image clarity and color reproduction they are middle of the road and the brightness is it s weakest setting imo  i have this monitor sitting next to a better monitor and the brightness is night and day  but on the plus side the text is very sharp and makes browsing the web very easy on the eyes  i haven t noticed any backlight bleeding either  so those are two positives for sure 
ok for the price but suffers on backlighting in bright conditions
the resolution on this monitor is pretty good for the price and it has lots of adjustment options  color is also good but nothing to get excited about  unfortunately  i think it a little dim and wish it had more back lighting  i have a large window next to my computer in my office and i don t have much control on the light coming through it  when the sun is bright  i have a hard time reading with this monitor  it easily catches glare from other light sources and bright fluorescent lighting  the price was very good but doesn t outweigh the back lighting issue  i m tempted to replace it after a month 
not at all true colors  not for artists or photographers 
this monitor is not bad but i took off 2 stars for forcing max saturation  no matter what settings i try  i can t get a normal saturation setting  i ve tried adjusting the color balance  gamma  everything  this monitor just wants to look like a gumball machine  everything is super saturated which might be great for a gamer but is terrible for any artist who wants to create print ready materials  disappointed  would not buy again
