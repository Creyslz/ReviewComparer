it looks good overall but   
this shelf looks decent on the wall  but there was a real battle for me to enjoy it  the quality seems mediocre  and the pieces don t match up exactly no matter how hard i tried  from anywhere other than directly next to it  it looks nice  admittedly  and i did receive a compliment on the style from a visitor  now to the nitty gritty  1  the instructions are pretty loose  they are on the box  so for goodness sake don t throw it out or tear it   i included a picture  there are no words  just a picture with the letters on it  it doesn t say if you should assemble pieces before mounting or just put it right to the wall so i ll tell you  assemble first  a drill doesn t fit in the spaces once it starts going together  2  the spaces are smaller than i imagined  i have various sized books and none of them can sit upright except my son s antique childrens stories  so don t get it to actually use as a bookshelf  it wont do  3  i love the color and the mock wood looks very nice  however  as you can see in the pictures  theres no stickers or anything to go on top of the screw holes  so theres just big shiny screws all over this dark nice wood look  overall i like it  but i don t love it  it isn t a bad price  but just know what youre actually getting  i received this at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of the product 
use your own wall anchors
i bought this for more storage in our guest bedroom  putting the shelf itself together was pretty straightforward  even though the instructions were only one page long  the pieces were all labeled well so it was easy to follow  however  the wall anchors that came with the kit were awful  they kept sinking into the wall when we tried to put the screw in  plus when one wall anchor failed  you would have to unscrew all the others and start over  which took up time  my suggestion is to go out and get your own large wall anchors to use  it will save you some trouble  but obviously the end result looks great  hence the three stars 
they look great  but the quality is not all there 
these seem amazing in the photo  but upon further inspection when receiving it i realized the quality of the design was not excellent  first  the screws are covered by poorly fitted plastic covers that blend with the shelf color  then i realized that either my wall corner was seriously off kilter or the shelves did not perform to expectations 
this looks great in my living room i use it for some    
this looks great in my living room i use it for some video game related collectable and i love how it looks and holds everything on it  however i will recommend you get proper wall anchor for dry wall as the included will not hold a paper clip to the wall  i must say while i love the shelf the lowest most part came damaged for me in that i could not screw it togeather and it was loose and almost completly broke durring assembly  outside of that this thing looks amazing holds up well and its really just a nice product 
easy to assemble but came with scratches
was super easy to put together and looks great on my wall  only thing i m a bit bummed out over is the amount of small scuff marks and scratches that were on each piece right out of the box  structurally it seems great and i got all the pieces i needed to secure it to my wall  for  20 though i would have liked less scratches  i can see from other reviews that others have had a similar experience  overall i m happy with it but probably wouldn t buy again 
nice  but use different hardware to hang
this shelf is ok  i ve purchased others that were sturdier then this model  i don t recommend using the hardware they provide to hang it  i used mollies i purchased from home depot  it does look nice after getting it hung up and is doing the job i purchased it for  holding books and such in my home office 
even though once it was put up it looked good  took forever to assemble and the instructions were    
extreme pain in the ass to put up  definitely would not purchase again  even though once it was put up it looked good  took forever to assemble and the instructions were extremely vague 
looks great  just a little flimsy while putting it
for the money it s decent  the screws wouldn t grab onto one of the holes so i had shove some toothpicks and wood glue into it to give the screw something to hold onto  once attached to the wall its ok  looks great  just a little flimsy while putting it together
i don t love this  i barely like it
i don t love this  i barely like it  i thought it would be great for a tiny statement piece in the random corner above the bed  it was easy enough to assemble based on the instructions  it is far too flimsy unstable to trust above me sleeping at night  i talking about the 5 tier  i should have gotten the smaller version  the mounting hardware is ridiculous and i ended up with a small hole in my wall and no corner shelf  i m sure if your handy you can add some sort of support and buy better mounting hardware but i m incredibly lazy and posting this review has pretty much tapped me out 
i will say it does look nice and color is as advertised
i ll start by saying shame on me for not checking the shelf dimensions  they appear much larger in the images then they actually are  so for now it will hold random objects instead of books  i can only give it 3 stars though as the shelves are still flimsy even after it s secured to the wall  i would not risk placing fragile or valuable items on this shelf  i will say it does look nice and color is as advertised  putting this together and installing it to the wall was also a breeze  if you re not looking to put any large items and don t mind it being a tad flimsy then this item is for you 
the wood option is person is much more dull than in the picture
the wood option is person is much more dull than in the picture  also the pieces do not fit well together even though i used the floor and a book case to check the alignment while i was screwing the pieces together  when on the wall there is space between the shelves and the wall  i guess they do kind of hold things so far  and it came on time with no parts missing 
small  cheaply made  needs improvements but looks okay
it was unfortunate the screw hiders were very cheaply made and are obvious  the shelves are small  like 4  wide and maybe 10  apart  just holds our remote and has to balance  looks nice once i fixed all the screw holes to counter sink and not stick out like a child made it 
wrong pieces sometimes    be careful 
great book shelf but i am happy i purchased two of them  vendor put all the wrong sizes in one and the other had the right ones  i give it a two becasue of the lack if attention to detail  since ai am handy inwas able to manuver the second shelf by drilling in wholes myself to fit the nails    but i can see a customer being completely annoyed by this defect  other than that great shelf   it holds up pretty well  if it wasnt for that    i ended up with unnecessary surplus of the wrong pieces    and the wrong nails  again thank goodness i had some lying around  this product would have gotten a 5 5  please fix this 
great idea and good proportions
great idea and good proportions  however ours had a random gouge as if someone started to drill a hole and then decided  no  not here   
looks cool  and seems somewhat stable even though i dont    
looks cool  and seems somewhat stable even though i dont have the shelves screwed into support beams  but they didnt give me all of the right pieces  i ended up getting an extra b piece and i was missing a d piece so now the screws are facing up on one of the shelves  looks out of place and kind of ugly relative to the rest of the shelves 
picture is deceiving
the items shown in the picture that are on the wall mount are larger items that have been photo shopped and sized down to make it look like they would fit  this mount is much smaller than it appears to be based on the picture 
out of the box the shelves were dirty and the white paint was horrible
it worked for what i needed it for but very cheaply made  out of the box the shelves were dirty and the white paint was horrible  not a great quality wood and wont hold much but they will work for now 
it s okay
looks decent in the corner i put it in  very easy to put it together except for me one of the screws was the wrong size and it started to break  it is very flimsy and light but for what i need it for it will have to work sine i don t feel like going through the hassle of returning it
