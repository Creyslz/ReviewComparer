these umbrellas kinda suck  the flower design is pretty  and yes  the umbrella is compact  however  unless you want to spend quite a bit of time folding the umbrella back to its original state so that it fits back into the little bag it comes with  the umbrella ends up rather bulky  the handle also does not stay in the retracted position  so hanging the umbrella on a hook is out of the question as the handle will just extend  i guess theyre ok for cheap umbrellas and theyre ok to have around as extras  other than that  spend your money on something better  ive purchased better umbrellas at the local drug store
