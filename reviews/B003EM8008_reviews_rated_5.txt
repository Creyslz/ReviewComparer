4 year durability and comfort fit tests
if you re looking for a testament on durability  reliability  and fit  here s my experience with these earphones  durability and reliability test   passed   four years of daily use and still functioning  been using this since 2012 during the day while i work to listen to music  these are the only earphones i use that do have not an in line microphone because it is not needed for my office work  this gets rolled and tossed into my bag every weekday  yet   no tears  no loose wires  earpads in tact  fully functioning  sound still crisp and clear  it can definitely stand the mild abuse  comfort test   passed  the fit is perfect for my ears   very ergonomic as the bud rests nicely in the concha  bowl shaped cavity  of the ear  cradled by the intertragal notch   like a snug hug  the earpads insert easily into place for a gentle cushioned feel  loosely  locking  into place very naturally  i ve worn these for hours at a time without any aching of the ear or hint of tension so the comfort is definitely there  i have also used them while walking  running  cleaning  and they rarely fall out   thank goodness  it s so bloody annoying when earbuds slip out  sound test   passed  let s be real  don t expect sennheiser quality audio on a earphone that costs less than popcorn at the movie theaters  but also don t brush it off either  the sound quality is rather good  to the average user  one most likely won t pick up the nuiances between amazing full bass  mid  or treble  these are definitely not bass enhanced so don t expect these to pump out your favorite bass powered beats to your liking  but they will do an acceptable job at nice highs and clear mids  general notes  because of the fit of the earpad into the ear canal  it does block out some noise  because i do use these for work  i normally just keep one of these earbuds in for the music while still being attentive within the environment  these earphones also do a decent job at keeping the audio  localized   meaning if you are jamming music at full blast  the sound will leak from the earphones  but not too much  i can be listening to music at a somewhat loud scale and no one around me can hear it at all  comfort fit comparison  i am an android user and faithful samsung galaxy series smart phone user  i have the old samsung galaxy s2 earphones and the new samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones to compare comfort ergo fit to  you ll see in my picture the stark difference in overall shape of the earbud from just three earphones  yet despite my loyalty to samsung galaxy smartphones  the fit of their earphones are always terrible  even the latest s6 edge earphone accessory  here is why the fit and comfort of the humble panasonic make my ears happier than most earpieces    see samsung galaxy s2 earphones  nice soft silicone gel earpad but poor earbud shape that doesn t  lock  into place with the natural shape of the outer ear  thus  it frequently comes out like a loose  thick q tip    see samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones  better quality silicone gel earpad that attempts to cushion the supposed natural shape of the ear canal entrance  but utterly fails for anyone with normal sized ears  even with the smallest size gel earpads  the earphones frequently pop out and is very annoying  not only that  the gel earpads frequently loosen from the buds itself and falls off  i got my s6 edge summer of 2015 and i have already used all spare gel earpads   another set of replacement earpads  if you look closely at the photo  i had to resort to a left earpad for my right earbud because i had no more replacement earpads to use   i am now down to a single earpad and am giving up on these stupid earphones in general  verdict  worth  four years on a product that works on a daily and fits great for price of  6  10  no brainer  incredibly reliable and good quality 
just buy these  seriously
i am at work  next to the window  and there is a literal jackhammer outside the window  i have these headphones in  listening to music  and i can t hear it at all  if you want that in your life  these are the earbuds for you 
shocked by how good these are 
i have a self appointed mission of finding inexpensive headphones that sound better than average  i have been on this quest for years as i am always never without my mp3 player or radio  i am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly  so i am always trying to find inexpensive headphones that sound better than my previous set  skullcandy ink d   this time  after carefully reading reviews  i purchased 3 different headphones at once  all in the same price range  under  15 00   the panasonic rp hje120 a  blue   the skullcandy jib  and the 2xl spoke  bounty hunter collection   my conclusions were that the 2xl spoke were adequate  but a distant third place  while the 2xl had definitively better bass than the skullcandy ink d  the 2xl s mids and highs were only adequate  the skullcandy jib completely blew the scullcandy ink d away  with much better bass  mids and highs  i thought i found what i had been looking for  that my quest had ended  but there was still the panasonic rp hje120 to listen to  i must say i had little expectation for these after listening to the skullcandy jib s  but what was this  immediately the panasonic s sounded impressive  after listening to them for a while  i listened to the jib s again  i honestly preferred the cleaner sound of the panasonic rp hje120  and the ergo design was a plus  the fit was just so comfortable  so there you have my layman s evaluation of these three headsets and my hands down recommendation for the panasonic rp hje120  i got the blue  however  i very much doubt that your color choice will affect the sound   i hope this helped 
must be fitted properly to hear bass frequencies
if you ve been wondering how such a highly rated product like this can also have one star reviews stating these earbuds have  absolutely no bass whatsoever  and sound  horribly tinny   i d like to offer an explanation  these panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds  if that s how you wear them  you ll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume  think 1960 s pocket transistor radio   these earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear  forming an airtight seal  if you choose too small of an earpad and or don t push them in far enough  you won t hear any low end frequencies  it s only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full range sound and volume  here s a quick analogy  tightly plug both ears with your fingers  close your mouth  and hum the lowest note you can  now take your fingers away  and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out  that s the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds  although the acoustic principles are different  these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum  otherwise they ll sound horrendous  unfortunately  panasonic wasn t very forthcoming on their product s packaging about how to wear the earbuds  and i m certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs  as an audio engineer  i can assure you these earbuds  when properly fitted  sound great  they re not audiophile quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a  200 pair of studio reference headphones  and they re not as ergonomic as a  150 pair of westones  but for the price  they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain    arguably one of the best product bargains i ve ever run across on amazon  do they have a lot of bass  they re not deficient in any of the low frequencies  but they re not bass enhanced earbuds  either  which some of you may be used to  they have a relatively nice  flat bass response as is  but if you want extra bottom end on your music  you ll want to boost the low end of your mp3 player s eq  fortunately  boosted lows  even the deepest of lows  are handled very well by these panasonics  as a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn  they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time  the earpads are very soft and pliable  though  and i personally don t experience any discomfort wearing them  since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear  there are two unique  negative issues to point out  1  be very careful not to drop your mp3 player  because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience  2  these earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it s racing during an intense workout  the incessant  tick tick tick  is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you re listening to  in summary  the audio quality of these earbuds  when properly fitted  will satisfy 99 9  of the general population  i would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise  but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while  these panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value 
these are fantastic 
compared to many other earbuds that i ve had that cost  75   100   150    these sound as good as any of them  i m astounded  i use these for running and i ve attached them to my sunglasses along with my ipod shuffle  i figured for  8  i could afford to sweat up a few of these and replace them whenever i needed to  i ve run 1 500 miles with these in the last year and a half   i ve gone through 4 pairs of new balance shoes  2 ipod shuffles  3 pairs of sunglasses and am on the same set of earbuds   and  they still sound great  see my picture of the earbuds on my sunglasses  pretty dorky  but hey  they work great and they stay in my ears too 
they could survive the apocalypse
alrighty  so here s what s gone down with these earbuds since i got them a year and a half ago  after losing i can t remember what happened to them these same pair of earbuds that i had had for a year  i bought the exact same ones  and they re the ones i have now  i have washed this pair twice  lost them in my college s attic while doing a service project  tearing apart mattresses and separating the materials for recycling  where they were almost thrown away and so covered in dust that i had to wash them  and recently i accidentally let the plug part and one of the earbuds hang out of my car while driving on the highway in torrential rain   the plug was ground into the pavement and is now lopsided looking  but  i tell you  they still freaking work  after all the craziness  granted  the left bud is sometimes a bit on the fritz  but if i just unplug and replug the cord it works again  the only reason i m back and writing a review is because i m about to purchase my third pair  the lopsided plug has a habit of sliding out and pausing whatever i m listening to because of the loss of the nobbly part at the tip 
going running
i can t believe these are so cheap  these sound fantastic  i mean i can feel myself getting fitter and more productive already  i put on a  running  song to try out the quality and i immediately wanted to go running  i don t really run  at least i haven t in a while  i think i ll go now  or maybe i ll clean the house   something that involves moving  i got purple cause every color is a slightly different price and they were one of the cheapest  i actually ended up liking the color  it comes with 3 different size rubber tips to fit your size ears 
buy these    trust me    you re welcome 
there were 32 000  verified purchases on this set of earbuds  and at the low  low price of  7 96  i figured if they weren t any good  well  it wasn t the end of the world  these are replacing a set of bose earbuds that i ve had for a couple of years  but they just wore out  i m not going to pretend that panasonic and bose are in the same realm of sound quality  i will make the argument these are a better set of earbuds if you don t need complete reproduction of the sound  first of all  these are way more comfortable than my bose  they fit in my ear better  the bose had the advantage of three point contact inside my ear  whereas the panasonic simply goes into the ear canal  but  the panasonic is softer and gentler inside my ear  second of all  the panasonic does a superior job of blocking outside noise  the bose was advertised as  noise reducing  and they weren t very good on that point  however  i always dismissed that because of the quality of sound reproduction  the panasonic reduces noise enough to where my wife can watch the tv at normal volume  and i can be in the same room streaming amazon video on my tablet and not hear the tv at all  and that s without cranking up the volume  third of all  despite not being bose  these little earbuds do an amazing job at sound reproduction  i will state that 99 9  of the time i use these earbuds to stream netflix or amazon video  i can hear everything clearly  i get a good feeling of  action  scenes  things blowing up  etc   i don t have a thing in the world to complain about as far as sound quality  however  i m also not playing music through them  these little eight buck earbuds are pretty awesome  and i m happy with my purchase 
i ve had these for over a year 
i ve had these for over a year  i bought a set of these and a set of jvc hafx at the same time  my first impression of these on my ipod 3 was  damn they re shrill  but then i remembered my wife used my ipod when she went for her walk the day before so i adjusted the treble and these sounded pretty good  then i took them out and plugged in the jvc buds  my first impression was damn they re shrill  i checked the settings and turned the treble most of the way down  on the same song  cannonball by supertramp  and listened to the whole song  every time the cymbals were hit  it felt like they were the main instrument in the band  even when i turned the treble off  midrange down and the bass up  they were still shrill  so i kept the panasonic ergofit earbuds and put the jvc s in a drawer in case of emergency but it would have to be an extreme emergency  just to be sure  i bought my wife a pair in grey so she can lie in bed at night and listen to a movie on her ipad  that way if mine ever break  um  babe  take these jvc buds  you ll love them and i m sure she will because she loves extreme treble  but really these are the best on amazon  i bought skullcandy  they lasted a month because when i take mine off  i wrap them around my ipod and toss them onto the floor where the charger is  and yet with both my wife and i abusing the same pair  turning the ipod all the way to 100  all the time and me tossing them on the floor  these have lasted me over a year  i actually bought this pair dec 12th 2004  i love them so much that i m going to get a set with the microphone because we just bought a smartphone so i m getting a 128 gb card and putting all the music on there so i can ditch the ipod and free up some pocket room 
solid earbuds for the price 
these earbuds are really great  i ve bounced around from a lot of different types  sizes  shapes  and colors  the actually buds of these are very small  which allows them to go fairly deep into your ear canal  this is good for multiple reasons such as filtering out noise   better bass  these are pretty lightweight also  which makes them nice to use while you re on a walk or on a long road trip  let s get to the sound now   the sound is nothing mind blowing  but it hits all the right areas  the volume gets loud enough  the bass is acceptable  these are   15 earbuds so let s not expect miracles   and the overall quality of the pitches tones is very good  i m not an audiophile by any means  but i can properly enjoy my music without any hassle  the quality on these earbuds are pretty good as well  everything is of sturdy construction and doesn t have any weird creaking from weak material  yes  i ve owned earbuds that have actually had this   the wires are thick enough to give you the confidence that they will last without needlessly increasing the weight  the earpads come in three sizes  small  medium  and large   they re comfortable and aren t a pain to have in your ears for hours like other ones could be  the volume control buttons are plastic y with a  slightly  less than decent  click  when using them  but this is nitpicking  they work fine and are good enough  the microphone   this is probably the weakest part of this  the sound quality when speaking isn t the best for people on the other side  no one has said it s unintelligible  but it can get a bit garbled  not a huge issue to me  but you should note this if this is going to be used primarily to talk to people  overall  a very solid set of earbuds for the price  again  this a is a 5 star rating for   15 earbuds  at this price point  i have no problem letting small things slip as mentioned above  well worth the money  i highly recommend these 
fit loosely but don t fall out
i used these every day for over a year   with not so gentle usage   before one side stopped working  normally  a set of earbuds only lasts me a few months  these have decent sound  but i especially like that they fit loosely in the ear without falling out or compacting earwax   my daughter crocheted over these and gave them to me for mother s day in 2015  for the first time  i had no trouble with lost earbuds or tangled wires  
easily the best  cheap  earbuds around 
these earbuds are amazing and for under  10   you cannot go wrong here  these earbuds have high ratings for a reason  i wasn t sure how awesome these were going to be when i ordered them  judging from the reviews  i figured they would be good but they blew my mind  these are fantastic  and for this price  i don t imagine you could get much better  they have a nice clear and crisp sound with some really really nice bass  i will put it to you this way   if you are a dubstep fan  you probably know bass cannon by flux pavilion   they can handle it    that song has some really loud parts and strong bass sections  the earbuds don t crackle or distort  they give really nice sound  i was listening to it at about 75  volume and it was super loud and super crisp  no reason to turn it up any louder  another song with really nice underlying bass is afterglow by phaeleh  and for those that know it  you know what i m talking about and these headphones make it sound phenomenal  not to mention they do a pretty good job and blocking out ambient noise  some key features of these earbuds are  they are lightweight  have an ergofit design  come in lots of colors  and they feature a 3 6ft cord  one negative thing i would have to say is about the cord   it tangles very easy  but most earbuds do tangle so it s not worth knocking a star off in my opinion  when you buy these earbuds  you will receive the buds with three included sets of earpads  s m l  for a custom  and comfortable fit  make sure you try all three while listening to music  pick the one that makes the music sound the best to your ears  the better you can hear the better the fit is  so i ve found  i originally thought i would need to use the smallest ones  but the sound i could hear out of the medium was better than the sound from the small  meaning the small wasn t fitting just right  so ultimately i went with the medium  it is important that you spend some time choosing the right size because by picking the right size you maximize bass quality  i use these headphones on my  running sunglasses  rig  picture attached  and they sound amazing and they don t fall out while i walk  run  or bike  they were the perfect choice for me for this setup i have  for anyone who wants to try what i ve done  i am using these sunglasses  rockbros polarized cycling glasses sports glasses sunglasses goggles   and an ipod shuffle 2gb  4th generation   overall the earbuds were perfect for my needs  i bought them mainly because they were so cheap and i figured if they get messed up while exercising it shouldn t be a huge deal  it s safe to say they exceeding my expectations by a long shot and if you re on the fence about these for whatever reason  don t be  they are fantastic little earbuds and you will not be disappointed with your purchase  if you have any questions about this product  feel free to ask me and i will answer to the best of my knowledge  and if this review was helpful to you  please consider leaving a positive rating 
just click buy already 
these little headphones are great  i put them in my ears the moment i got them and did yardwork for three hours  they were perfectly comfortable and noise isolating  allowing the music to play cleanly and loud enough to overcome the lawnmower  the only thing i thought could use improvement  and for seven dollars it s still not that big a deal  was the cable is kind of flimsy  so i took 20 minutes and splice the cable into some para cord shrink tubing and now they feel like  100 earbuds  the sound is a little bassy  but very punchy and clear  perfect for airline travel 
great for people with presidential ears who sweat like sylvester stallone in a montage
hey  im james brains with the brains report  and this is my video review of the panasonic rp hje120 k in ear headphones  i bought these headphones because my family steals my headphones every chance they can get  and  if they dont getem  then i break them because i dont know how to have nice things  i only buy cheap headphones for the above reasons  why spend good money on something i wont get to enjoy  i have had these headphones for almost ten months now and have not had any issues  i mainly wear them to listen to podcasts while running  biking  and walking  i run in all weather  and i sweat like sylvester stallone in a rocky montage  this has not caused the headphones to malfunction  despite my giant presidential ears  i also have not had any issues with the headphones jostling loose  except for one time in the spring when i ran in gale force winds  they did not stay in no matter how hard i tried  the sound is great for podcasts  i rarely listen to music on them because i like to try to better myself as a person  and i dont learn anything from people telling me about what they did up in da club or how theyre emotional  my biggest complaints are that the cords get all tangled when i stuff them in my pocket  one time  it took me ten minutes to get them untangled  for the most part  its not that big of an issue  my other complaint is that its hard to see the r and l signifying the left and right  irrespectively  but  heres a little pro tip  tie a little knot in the cord by the right headphone and remember thats knot right  if you have any questions  please comment below  im here to help 
awesome little bud
i bought these just because of the hype surrounding them  i own several pairs of headphones and earphones  when i first put these on and listened  i was unimpressed  but i misjudged them  because after comparing them back to back with my sony mdrxb40ap  i found that the treble on the sony was actually a bit too much  almost harsh  because when i put the panasonic back on  listening to the treble was like my ears were on soft comfy pillows  the mid range was more present on the panasonic than on the sony  and the bass was good  however the sony beat the panasonic in that category  but honestly  it should  since the sony was about 6x more expensive  and it is literally called  extra bass   the clarity and definition was also better on the sony  but again  i would expect it to be for the price  all in all  the sound you re getting is nothing to sneeze at  and for about  6  7  you really can t get a better deal  these are worth it for the unique driver chamber and nozzle design alone  they really are an ergonomic fit  so  if you really don t have money to spend  get these  and even if you have better earphones  but just wanna compare  these are a fun buy  and they come in great colors  i m glad i got mine in red  i would ve gotten blue  but blue is just so    not red  y know 
great ear buds but beware of gadget cases
see photo  one reviewer here actually had a negative review and they were right  if your gadget is inside a case   and that case s audio hole is too small   you are hosed  these will not work  if they do fit your case  if applicable  then you are home free  these by far are the best  bang for the buck  ear buds i ve ever purchased  they are both cheap and good  but i can t say it enough  there s a rectangular block of plastic at the end of these ear buds  where the audio prong is  mine just barely fit into my phone s case  i tried to include a ruler in the photo to help you measure yours  friends i kid you not  if that audio area in your case is smaller than the one in the photo   these won t work for you  otherwise they are absolutely wonderful 
panasonic earbuds
for the longest time  i was purchasing cheap  non branded earbuds  the lifespan of these were not very long  either the headphone connection went bad or one of the sides would short out  which started with this annoying crackle  by the time i added it all up  i was spending so much i might as well pay for a better pair  that s my stupidity  it s hard to believe how many types of earbuds there are  too many to choose from  out of them all  i decided on this pair  for the price  i can t get over how well these panasonic earbuds sound  the sound is clear and there is just enough bass where it isn t overbearing  in comparison to the cheaper pairs i was previously buying  the sound is 10 times better and doesn t have that  tin can  effect  now  take note on this particular pair i am reviewing does not have a built in microphone nor volume control  but for my simple taste i don t need all that  if you do  i would try another model or brand  goodluck 
my review revisited better than i first wrote
 see my update  if you have a tin ear these might please you  tinny doesn t even begin to describe their sound  the crappiest headphones i have ever purchased  i read a review on cnet that these were great and had great bass sound  nothing could be farther from the truth  they sound like music in a tin can  extremely bright treble crashes on your ear drums like clattering silverware on a marble floor  using the eq doesn t help much at all  don t buy these unless you have no ear for quality sound and hate anything non treble  update  i have found that using the largest silicone cushions greatly enhances the quality of sound  so i have upgraded from one star to five  the bass came forward way  way more when i used the larger cushions  i should have remembered that from my last set of buds that used fitted silicone cushions  also  i put the buds in my ears according to their marked position which required a magnifying glass and strong light to see on the back of each bud  panasonic needs to color in the l and r to be more visible  yes  these are much more comfortable than the apple earbuds  but not yet ready to say they sound better  i still feel they are too bright on treble  but i am way more happier with them now  well worth the few bucks in comparison to apple s pricing  i do miss the volume and pause controls  however 
the sound is good  the fit is comfortable  the shipping is fast  and the price is right 
these earbuds are great  the earbuds are surprisingly comfortable  and produce a fantastic sound even when the volume is low  they drown out background sounds extremely well  even when i just have the buds in with no sound coming through  my office can get noisy  and sometimes its nice to mute it out  without having to counter it with more sound   the cord is the common plastic cord  nothing braided  wrapped  or fancy as with some other earbuds  so i will be cautious when handling to reduce the occurance of accidental cord pinching  although the design seems a bit odd at first glance  the fit is actually perfect  seriously  its perfect  and i have had no issues with them falling out as im putting around with them in  it also came with 2 other sizes of silicone caps for the earbuds if the first ones arent a match for everyone else  the color is fun and keeps them from getting lost in the sea of black and white cords  so many cords    it comes with a built in mic  a personal must have  and from what ive tested so far  it picks up sounds with crystal clear clarity  it doesnt have volume control  as some other ones do  but thats not a big deal for me  i really like these  the sound is good  the fit is comfortable  the shipping is fast  and the price is right 
excellent price to quality relationship
after breaking another pair of earphones i had to go through the process of choosing and getting a new one  i did not want to spend a lot but at the same time didn t want to have them broken after less then few months  so i went to amazon and looked what the best seller and amazon s suggestions are  in the beginning i was very skeptical about panasonic earphones  not only because of a low price  but also because i never owned a pair of this brand  i whatsoever decided to order these to try them out  i am amazed by the quality after having used them for half a year  they did not go bad at all  the sound quality is just fine  none of the strings broke  earbuds are soft and did not get lost or disconnected and it fits great with all of my devices  the only disadvantages are that since the strings are thin  they often get messy and that this set does not have a microphone  however  having that said  it is still an incredible quality price relationship  i am fully satisfied with my choice and strongly recommend these for people with small budget for earphones 
great sound  noise isolation   fit  size  price
these are the best of the best in ear headphones for the price  and here is why  1  i have about 15 different headphones  some of them are very high end  and only reason i bought these was its size  i sleep on my side and play something until i fall a sleep or listen an audio book  when you turn to side to fall a sleep with earbuds in your ears  you need really small ones that doesn t protrude outside contours of ears  otherwise pillow presses to earbuds into your ear canal and it hurts  so these earbuds are so small and excellty fit  you can turn to side and fall a sleep when they are in your ears  2  they sound fantastic when compared to peers like sony or apple or many other unknown chinese brands  music is crystal clear  and detailed  great bass  incredible sound staging  for this price it is a steal  after listening this  you wouldn t put crappy apple earbuds again  as you can guess i use an iphone as a source  3  i would never expect noise isolation from these buds  but anatomically it seals to ear canal very well  key is silicon seals attached to an oval opening instead of a circular one like many other earbuds  so it fits better  when you listen music with these earbuds  it seals surrounding noise so well  you can t hear a ringing office phone in front of you  i compare this the benchmark active noise canceling bose quitecomfort 35 bluetooth headphones  and i own one  these little earbuds seals background noise nearly as good as bose  since they are very tiny and you can fall a sleep when these one in your ears  so this 8  little earbuds are more convenient than 350  bose headphones  by all means bose sounds better  size always matters  4  price  only 8  incredible for this kind of sound quality  5  durability is unknown  since i have been using only for a month  but they are perfect 
mic sounds good   audio sounds good   right angled jack is ideal for smart phones
great microphone  great audio  and right angle jack makes phone more pocket friendly  i have bought sooo many  official approved  apple earpods  and they all break  mostly because when i put my phone in my front pocket and then sit down  the cable juts out from the phone in a straight line  and eventually it wears out  so that signal starts cutting out to one of the ears  or the microphone fails  and i ve tried to buy knock offs  and those sound terrible  or their mics are awful  today  i received this panasonic ergofit  i ve tested the sound and the microphone  both are excellent  for this price   and  best of all  the right angled jack means that now my phone will sit easier in my pocket  and the cable will be less likely to get damaged  i m hoping these last a long time  if you re looking for an affordable set of ear buds that sound good  have a good microphone for calls dictation  and a right angle jack  i heartily recommend this  and i m someone who  rarely  writes reviews 
i never review items   these are freaking awesome
i ll keep this short  these headphones sound amazing for less than 10 bucks  i purchased them in july of 2016   i wasn t at all familiar with panasonic products  just read everyone s reviews  the current pair that i have in my ears have to have over 1 000 sweaty miles of running on them  honestly  i ve sweat  and ran over 1 000 miles in these headphones  i just finished my second marathon  and these suckers have been in my pocket in nearly 40 states  i wear them every single day   and i m dreading the day when i have to get the i phone 7   because i ll have to use bluetooth headphones  and i hate that  again  i rarely rave about products on amazon  but these simply are phenomenal  there s a reason they have 42 000 five star reviews  keep up the good work panasonic  i ll never own another pair of headphones 
great little earbuds for the price
great sound for a cheap set of earbud headphones  really can t complain for the price  the mic on the line with a button to mute end calls works wonderfully  as well as the voice quality as reported by people on the other end  cons  the cord has developed a permanent twist and can tangle easily but hardly a complaint for  9 headphones  especially with the quality of sound you might find in  65 equivalent  construction could be better  fairly low grade plastic and thin leads to the earbuds  but the minijack connector is angled  sturdy  and compact  again  not bad for the price 
the dark horse
you know how there are so many headphone brand names that you sometimes forget about the really inexpensive  cheap looking ones because you don t believe that they would ever compare  yeah  i totally underestimated the panasonic rphje120v in ear headphones  holy s     let me tell you  for  7 49  you can have a wonderful in ear headphone experience with these suckers  although the violet didn t look like the picture  it s no reason to take a star away from these cute earphones  with every in ear headphone  it is crucial to find which set of earbuds properly fit your ear  these earphones came with three different sizes  similar to some other earphones that i have  these specific earphones have a circular structure  but an oval like design  thus  they are supposed to fit snuggly into your ear and they are supposed to literally fully plug your ears to reach their maximum potentially  please keep that in mind when you are trying to by in ear headphones  i learned after buying  returning  and losing a few earbuds  as i never had a chance  or gave them a chance  to test the earbuds out out of my laziness  these earphones are comfortable  have a very impressive sound  and music can be clearly heard  i listened to a few intense piano pieces to quiet ones  and also listened to wu tang and then some frank sinatra after  lol  i m not disappointed by these and i don t think i ever will  i consider this a dark horse because panasonic may not be bose  sennheiser  audio technica  or any other high quality brand  but these will sweep you away if you just let them 
does it s job well 
bought from seller  amazon com llc  and have been using this item for half a year now  needed an earpiece with a mic since i needed to use my hands often whenever people call me  i haven t personally heard that the mic sounds like on the other end  but i m told it works pretty well  even in the car on the highway  my girlfriend said she didn t even notice i was in the car when we talked  also  i ve accidentally tugged on wires numerous times and it still works perfectly fine and when i store it  i like to knot is to keep it from getting tangled and just throw it in my bag pocket   i ve attached a picture  it also comes with 2 extra pairs of earbud tips in case you need one smaller or bigger than the one it comes with   or if you lose one   would recommend for anybody looking for a cheap headset with a mic and isn t picky about crystal clear audio 
i thought they were pretty good  but these are better
for years  i ve been using a pair of samsung buds that came with my s3  i thought they were pretty good  but these are better  the sound quality is very good  my laptop has always had a very pronounced hiss over my s3 headphones  with these  the hiss is much less pronounced  obviously they won t be able to duplicate bass the way larger speakers can  but because they seal the ear canal they actually do a pretty good job with the bass  producing a very nice and even sound  comfort is also very good  they come with three different sizes of rubber cushions  and the shape of the earbuds very nice  it s lower profile than my samsungs and it also conforms more to the shape of the ear  helping to keep them from falling out  the way they seal the ear canal also provides a little attenuation of background noise  you couldn t use them as ear protection when shooting a gun or anything like that  but they help a little with background noise and such  all in all  very happy customer 
great quality product  and highly recommended 
i was so upset at my hubby when i asked for headphones with in line control  and he ended up ordering these  not only did they not have in line control  but they were also that funny shape  which i ve always hated  i put all three pairs he bought me into a drawer  and walked away from them  then  months later  my last pair of  good  headphones finally broke  and i was desperate enough to pull one of these out  protesting the entire time  it took only a few uses to convince me otherwise  they are some of the best headphones i ve ever owned  the  funny  shape makes them so comfortable in my ear  the sound quality is amazing  and i have been using the same pair for months now  without them going bad  i will order more of these when the time comes  and get extras to give out to family members  great quality product  and highly recommended 
 5 50 or  105 50 these sound awesome 
i have quite a collection of headsets both earbuds and over the ear full sized cans from inexpensive skull candy to higher end shure in ear monitors  bose over ear and v moda crossfade m100s and these little baby s hold their own against them all  surprising bass and decent separation and i got a green pair for like  5 50 or some crazy low price  unbelievable  if for nothing else grab a set just to throw in the consol of your car for emergencies  update  so my shure iem s finally failed on me  i lost the left channel so i started using these as my go to buds and i m still blown away with their stellar sound  i feel no need to replace my high end earbuds because these do the job very nicely  one thing i ve noticed now that i use them daily for hours on end is they fit very comfortably  more so than any other earbuds i ve used in the past and they stay put very well  again  better than any other earbuds i ve used  you simply can t go wrong with a set of these  i m buying up a few more sets as backup and to give out to friends and family 
good for the price  no regrets
durability 5 5  bought these almost 4 years ago and they have lasted me extremely well  i had a pair of samsung earbuds that came with my phone about 3 years ago and they eventually died about 2 1 2 years after regular usage  these earbuds  however  are very hardy and durable  i wrap them up a little too tightly  i admit  and there is absolutely no sign of wear and tear on the cord  the in ear part is also very sturdy  taking a reasonable amount of jostling  and so far so good  model 3 5  it did take a lot of getting used going from the old  traditional earbuds to the in ear style  i have terrible sinuses and so i will never truly get over how they suction into your ear  and when they get ripped out after having a good suction   awful     because of the in ear  suctiony ness  you will also get cord noise  as in  every time that you touch the cord or it rubs up against something  it will be very obvious and amplified  this is unpleasant until you get used to ignoring it  all of these things seem less about quality  and more just about getting used to this kind of earbud  sound 5 5  i m not an audiophile by any means  but these earbuds have a really strong bass kick  quite good sound for the price    not tinny at all  not muted at all  not scratchy at all  i m very impressed with the audio that these cheap little things can push out     edit  compared to higher end over the head headphones  i can tell that the bass is definitely boosted and the mids to highs are diminished  however  the overall sound is still clear  it s crystal clear sound  but with heavy base and the absence of some higher tones  you won t notice that the highs and some mids are missing unless you re listening to stuff with heavier emphasis on those registers  but if you re really into strong bass  these will definitely do the job  comfort 4 5  once you get used to the in ear aspect  these are actual pretty comfortable  i ended up taking the rubber ends off and putting on different ones that fit into my ear better  however  the actual shape of the earbud  being slightly angled  allows it to rest in the ear quite comfortably  just don t lay on your side with your ear squished into the pillow or that will be uncomfortable really fast  overall  5 5  i won t take off stars for my discomfort due to going inside the ear canal and then suctioning there because that is just how this kind of earbud works 
good fit   good sound
panasonic ergofit in ear earbuds headphones with mic controller rp tcm125 k  black  is great  these fit well in the ears and are very soft and comfortable  as you know good fit   good sound    fit is important    these fit well  cord is a comfortable size and convenient    not one of those short cords that can be annoying  microphone works well  sound is great    crystal clear sound even while on a new york city subway  which is loud   for the price point these will blow you away  of course  they are not the quality of the ones that cost hundreds of dollars   seems strong and durable  exceeded expectations and highly recommend
still the best in class 
still the best  i am an audiophile jerk who loves accurate  clear sound  i enjoy pop  but usually classical music and opera are my thing  most inexpensive headphones are colored with way too much bass and otherwise  don t have the volume of a timid mouse  sometimes thin  sometimes tinny  sometimes anemic  or all of the above  for ten bucks  these are the richest sounding in the ear headphones i have ever owned  i use these with my google pixel and the nt app which offers fantastic eq  imaging  volume  and detailed reproduction of even the most delicate passages  and  i am a clutz  i have gotten in the car and drive for miles with these puppies dragging on the pavement  they still work perfectly  m french bulldog has played with them  and i have slept on them  stepped on them  and had them out in the rain  takes a licking  and keeps on ticking  highly recommend  while your are at it  buy a dozen 
perfect fit for all
earphones always seem to fall out because my ears are small  these come with three different sizes  of course i use the smallest  turns out our newest puppy also prefers them so after she carefully took each one off and chewed them to bits  i used the next size ear pads  these fit well but i still prefer the smallest because they stay in snug while i listen to music  to fall asleep and don t usually fall out  our puppy doesn t discriminate  she loved this size so much she caused a little damage to the cords that couldn t be paired  i immediately ordered a new pair and used my husband s iphone 7 earphones   yuck   iphone anything is overrated and horrific quality   i didn t have to worry about that for too long anyways because the puppy feels exactly as i do and ripped those to shreds  she is now my favorite dog   her name is siri and even she hates the iphone earphones  these panasonic earphones can handle bass  any volume  the mic for calls works better than others as well  no one can tell they are on my headset or hear background noise like wind blowing  noisy kids and naughty puppies  yes  i put my earphones away or up high so she couldn t reach them  she s more intelligent and better looking than most people  she even got that silly iphone case open to eat those earphones  siri knows it all     my dog  not the iphone ai 
i m impressed 
i m a bit of a stickler for audio  but am not fortunate enough to buy a pair of headphones without selling those i used before it  so headphones breaking is a devastating outcome for someone such as me  when they do though  you re forced to the budget market  now  i don t like iem s  but these deliver  especially for the price  now  the quality of the build isn t anything particularly satisfying to feel or look at  but i m someone who fiddles with things  i ve become accustomed to swinging the earbuds  and despite the several times i ve smacked these on the ground or even stepped on these  they refuse to break  a big problem i have with iem s are comfort  i find sticking something in my ear really kind of gross  you could imagine that the design of these would be an instant turn off  as they re designed to literally go into your ear canal  didn t matter  i used the smallest size pads and stuck them in  for 30 minutes i could have them in and feel no discomfort  which is crazy for iem s  i m happy with the comfort of these for what they are  but don t expect to want to have them on for over an hour  i ve tried to divide this into sections of build  comfort  features and sound  but these really don t have any features  regularly this would be a degradation  but they don t need to  they don t have multimedia controls  which was a bit saddening  but the sound quality makes up for that  now  the sound quality is what really surprised me  the panasonics are bass heavy  and they re not very refined  however  it s not overbearing or boomy  which makes me okay with it  the bass is enjoyable  it can excite you  the mids are definitely the mid range and low mid range is really where these things shined  the clarity and separation still surprise me at times  and in a good way  the highs are rolled off a little too soon for my liking  but they aren t sibilant  and they re audible  the audio is enjoyable at all frequencies  another things that surprised me about the audio was the soundstage  which was surprisingly large for something literally inside of your head  larger than the m50x s at least  and some low end bose headphones  definitely worth the 10 dollars just for that  the imaging is lackluster  but they can t all be winners  it s just not immersive enough  then again  i m using these on the go for school and the bus  i can imagine people talking literally inches away from my ears would make for a rather grounding experience  noise cancellation is solid  not much to say there  passive  it s good  isolation really surprised me though  using it in a classroom i can have my music cranked up to max  too loud for my ears  and no one could possibly hear me  great  worth ten bucks  worth 25  arguably worth 40 50  buy them if you need them  and you wont be disappointed 
much better sound than anticipated
bottomline  great stuff for the money  good sound  not super sturdy looking but can t complain  i really needed a new pair  given that my previous earbuds  jlab  broke a couple days ago after 2 years of constant use  i was hesitant about these  the reviews  although mostly positive  also showed some troubling sights  poor quality  easy to break  etc  i cancelled the purchase 3 hours after ordering because the reviews did not promise good results  but after some more searching  i realized these were my best option for the price  so i bit the bullet  yes  the cable seems thin  yes  the shape looks weird on the picture  but in person they are quite comfortable  if you use the smallest rubber piece  these don t come with those  but i had a spare from my dead earbuds  the sound is full  has plenty of bass  and doesn t fall particularly flat  definitely a good purchase for the price  i will update in a couple of months  and see how well they hold up with daily use 
comfy 
this is by far the most comfortable earbud i have ever used  i hate earbuds  they are painful or bothersome to me at all times  even when i swap out the rubber thingies to change the  size   a certain company named after a fruit have the worst ever  how do people even wear those  ugh  i bought these because some other reviewer said they were comfortable  they are  i barely notice i have them in  with other brands  skullcandy  etc  i always have to stop and take it out a while because of discomfort  these i could wear all day and never touch  sound  whatever  i can hear my playlists in my office just fine  i m not a sound quality snob  so i really can t comment on the ins and outs of the sound quality  can i hear my music  yes  do they feel like house slippers for my ear  yes  i m ordering about 5 more to replace all my current pairs of painful brands  if you have a picky ear  and you aren t a sound snob  get them 
best buy for the price  don t spend more than you need to on in ear earbuds 
for the price  are you kidding me  don t expect audiophile levels of quality from these earbuds  but if your looking for something to produce noises in your ear and are equally concerned with the price as the quality these are the perfect middle ground  i have purchased far more expensive headphones that ve produced a relatively equivalent level of audio quality  i don t use these to listen to music often  and wouldn t really recommend in ear earbuds to do so  instead  i use them to watch films and videos  or listen to audiobooks and podcasts  via my phone  as a product to meet those needs  the price point and quality of these really can t be beat  i can t recommend these enough  especially given the fussy nature of earbuds  i don t think its justifiable spending a price several times higher for quality a fraction better than these  knowing that eventually the earbuds will just stop working anyway  these are as well built as earbuds i ve bought that cost more than 10x the price  i fully expect these to break like those did  but its a lot easier to justify spending less than 10  when that happens than it was to spend over 100  
great sound and fit
these are the best headphones i have bought and i have bought tons of them  you know how things have changed and is hard to find a good product that it does not cost you an arm and a leg and works decently  these headphones are great  great sound  good fitting  i use them on the bicycle or when i lay down to listen to meditation music  they stay on i dont have to worry the wind will knocked them out my ears or when i lay down on bed  even when i move around they stay on    i have bought a few but always wait when they are on sale  the first one i bought was only  7  when i came back to buy another pair the price was much higher  i have bought 4 and always check the price and buy more because like a haircut when you find someone who does your hair right you pray they live forever  i bought a few because i have spent so much money on headphones and spent top dollars and none satisfy me like these ones 
wonderful headphones  perfect price 
these are great headphones  truly superb  i use them every night  you see  i m a bit of an insomniac  and my partner snores  loudly  deviated septum and denial about potential sleep apnea  we re working on it   if i only wear earplugs  the thoughts in my head race and i will never fall asleep  not when there are so many things to think about and worry about and question     including  i kid you not  the fact that there are more than four states of matter    and what would happen to matter at absolute zero   these are the things that keep me up at night  so i listen to podcasts  soothing  calm  australian podcasts with the most lovely voices that i get so lost in i can t focus on the words     which puts me to sleep  sweet  blissful  sleep  except snorey mcsnorepants can t sleep if i play my podcasts in the room at large  and i can t sleep with snoring  these headphones have a low enough profile that i can sleep on my side without hurting my absurdly sensitive ears  and they manage to block enough sound that on a good night  i don t need earplugs  just headphones  on a bad night  i put one earplug in the ear facing up and one headphone in the ear on the pillow and i sleep beautifully  they re comfortable  they offer great sound quality  and they block sound better than most headphones  at last  we can both get some sleep  usually 
so far so good 
ok  i ve only used these once  so i can t comment on durability  i can say that i have very small ears  and other earbuds hurt     my husband loves his earbuds  but to me they are torture devices  i ve always been jealous of the fact that he is able to use pocket sized headphones  while i have to carry around big bulky over ear ones  i gave these a try because they come with small  medium  and large ear plugs  i put on the small  of course  and for the first time i was able to use earbuds without pain  there s still kind of a strangeness to having something in my ear  but they are comfortable enough that i am able to enjoy my music or audiobooks while running or walking  i am not a sound geek at all  so i can t say how these compare to fancy schmancy sound systems  but i listened to a playlist of old favorite songs  and they sounded as good as i remember them  i listened to some of an audiobook and was able to hear every word clearly  i am so happy to finally have pocket sized headphones of my own that i could cry tears of joy 
a great earbud option at an extremely reasonable cost  with great sound and a long life span 
teens lose earbuds at an astronomical rate  i m not sure how it happens  as the earbuds are always plugged into their phones  and their phones never get lost   anyway  i ve purchased earbuds of all brand and price levels  including a set of beats for my hubby  which did not sound as great as advertised  were too expensive and broke within a year of usage   anyhoo  these panasonics are fantastic  great sound  even better price  i have purchased 5 sets and keep them hidden from the family until there s an earbud emergency  as long as they re not lost  they last a long time   the set i use are 2 years old and still kick out great sound  without any issues with the cord  they re also comfortable in ear  they are not the round in ear cushion  but flat ish  they fit perfectly  these are a great earbud option at an extremely reasonable under  10 cost  with great sound and a long life span  thanks panasonic 
great cheap buds  i have several pairs for home and office 
this is my cheap earbud of choice  in fact  i ve bought about 8 pairs of these  don t expect them to last more than 6 months or so  but i lose things often enough or ruin them by my own accord that i never want to spend more than 10 bucks  i ll get to the airport cursing my inevitable forgotten item  and then have bought these same headphones for triple the price at hudson news  they come with three sizes of squishy bits for inside your noggin  i tend to use the biggest and find switching the bits very easy  makes it nice for cleaning too  when these headphones do go  it is rarely the jack that is the problem  6 out of 7 times it s been one earpiece losing volume by about 50  making everything uneven  still  five stars for the price  you can t get mad when you pay so so little 
these are truly fantastic 
these ear buds are easily every bit as good as described  i m actually shocked at the quality of the product for such a small price tag  the sound is crisp and clear  the buds are comfortable to place and don t make my ears hurt after extended wear  many products do   i ve had these for several months now  and with moderate use i ve noticed no change in the quality or the performance  i have an iphone 5s  and even with a case they fit into the jack well  my husband has a different case and they don t fit quite as snugly  but he s still able to use them  in fact  my husband had a more expensive pair that he used daily  they stopped working a few weeks ago so he asked to borrow mine  after one use he noted that these are better than the more expensive ones he d previously used  he enjoyed them so much he asked me to order a pair for him  i ordered the blue ones  and they re a beautiful electric blue  the color is exactly as pictured  the right and left are clearly labeled  the cord is an appropriate length to use on phone  ipad  etc  the buds are clear and have stayed clean and maintained their shape throughout hours of use  the only small draw back is the lack of microphone  unable to use these to make phone calls   that s not really an issue for me  but it was the one thing my husband said he liked more about his other pair 
great for the price
i ve been using these for almost 5 months now  so we haven t quite reached the six month death sentence that i usually have with earphones  and i ll update my review should that happen  but so far i ve been enjoying them  and really impressed at how cheap it is  the sound quality is great  better than the headphones i bought for  30  fits comfortably in my ear  i ve noticed it recently glitching  like how when earphones start nearing their end  and one ear keeps start stopping the sound with every move you make until it just stops  this doesn t do that  at least not yet  instead of the sound stopping  the volume is just lower  but i don t notice it all until maybe i shift and suddenly the volume is louder and i think  wait i was listening on low volume awhile ago   the quality is good enough that it doesn t sound that way lol  so at least the way it glitches doesn t annoy me  and isn t noticeable  i ll see how it holds up 
these buds are grea      i reordered these as holiday stocking stuffers
over 50k positive reviews for these panasonic earbuds     yup  they are good  definitely  not bose or jaybird full range sound quality but these affordably priced in air buds are a great second pair for leaving in my desk drawer  what i like most about these buds  the ear pieces are comfortably soft and actually do a good job blocking out a lot of outside noise  the sound quality is good     works for me listening to podcasts and when i just want some background music in my head    the buds fit in ear and stays there without slipping out  these panasonic buds are definitely value for your money     attractive too  see my photos in customer images i reordered these as stocking stuffers over the holidays     hope my review and photos were helpful     jeffrey a   jeff 
worth every penny  great fit  tough as nails  reviewed years after purchase   still going strong
these are better at noise cancelling than the ones designed to do that job and far less expensive  i beat them up mowing a large property and not once has a bud pulled loose from the earpiece  my motorcycle helmet has bluetooth speakers but if i m in a hurry i just use these and even in a snug helmet they work perfectly and i barely hear the external sounds  not exactly safe  but hey  it s all about the music and i am super watchful anyway   great job 
great value 
i m pleasantly surprised by these earbuds  i have tried a number of different sets that have been in the  30 and below range and so far my favorite have been the creative ep 630 s  i m not sure why  but i always passed these up when looking for new ones to try  but based on the overwhelming positive reviews and the low cost i decided to give them a shot  i m glad i did because to my ears these sound as good or close to those ep 630 s  i probably need to compare the two more but i m thrilled in just the fact that i can even say that much  the bass sounds great  it s deep with not much distortion and the mid and higher ranges sound good as well  i found the fit to be good and comfortable as well  bearing in mind that i do most of my music listening while lounging and not while doing some physical activities  but i would surely think they would stay in and work well for that too  these are a great product that are an incredible value and i have no qualms about recommending them to anybody that doesn t need some crazy expensive audiophile level earbuds 
very comfortable  incredible sound  especially for the price 
i am amazed at the bass these things put out  don t get me wrong  they sound quite nice and balanced otherwise  but they can handle bass like i couldn t believe  they re not exactly audiophile grade in ear monitors  but for the price  they re fantastic  my fellow amazonians steered me right on these  i m tempted to grab another pair or two just in case my current pair breaks or gets lost  it was also completely worthwhile to grab one of the little zip close protector cases  made by bluecell  on amazon  as a bonus  they re literally the most comfortable earphones i ve ever worn  i got a pair for my girlfriend as well  and she s now ruined for life when it comes to earphone sound quality  she used to be just fine with the stock earphones that came with whatever phone or music player she had  but not any more   
earbuds that deliver
i ve purchased these earbuds six times  over the course of seven years  i don t play nice with my earbuds   they re almost constantly plugged into my phone  even when i m not using them  i know you re not supposed to wrap your earbuds around your phone  but that s really the only way i store them  whoops   usually they break at the end of the wire  near the jack  there was once where the plastic part of the earbud itself popped out  i m not especially picky about sound quality   i can tell when an audio file was ripped off youtube  but that s about it  i am  however  really picky about fit  most earbuds and headphones cause too much pressure in my ears and can make me feel nauseated  these earbuds fit comfortably and don t cause any pressure  that s honestly the main reason why i ve purchased these year after year  i ve tried high end earbuds   30 100   and none of them fit as comfortably as these  so long as i don t find a better fitting earbud that promises greater durability for a reasonable price  i ll continue paying my meager annual dues  thanks panasonic 
don t pay more  these are the same headphones sold elsewhere for more 
great headphones   i originally bought these as  yamaha  headphones and they were  30  i saw these on amazon and they looked exactly the same for a quarter of the price  after testing them  i am certain they are exactly the same product  they sound good  not great  but i don t need great for what i use them for  because they lie close to your ear  they are perfect for sleeping in  i put my headphones in and play some music to put me to sleep and they stay in my ears well and i can sleep on my side  because i sleep with them  they will eventually fall apart  but these have survived very well  they are already into the first year  and they are still going strong  i should buy a couple more pairs and throw away the dozens of other pairs i have laying around 
by far the best phones under  10 i have ever tried
wow  i have purchased many headphones   dual driver  is the way to go for any phones over 25   others such as soul republic sl99  and beyer dynamics sound great but have some drawbacks for a price range over 35 99   with that said i have tried all kinds of phones in the 100  range  so lets forget price for a moment  these are by far the best phones under  10 i have ever tried  they are pretty much the best i ve tried under 25   once i get into discontinued phones selling for 30  that used to sell for 70  100  these start to compare on that level  as with all single driver phones these may begin showing on the mid to high tones  but these are still pretty tight on the midtones at higher levels  they don t fall out of my ear  hold in the sound from background noise when inserted correctly and using the proper ear pieces given  are pretty lightweight as well  cons  packaging is the old  blister style  pain in the butt to open  need a razor or strong scissors  they are not tangle free  i would like to see panasonic make a 15  version with a larger driver 
very comfy and durable  
update july 2 2017  at some point  i ended up using these as my primary headphones  after adjusting to them  they are actually very comfortable  the first several times i wore them  see my original review  below  they weren t that comfortable but i evidently didn t give them enough of a chance  1  they are very comfortable to wear even over long periods of time  i use them as my headphones for all day at work and they don t bother my ears  2  they stay in just fine working  walking  etc  i haven t tried them while jogging but i ve yet to have much issue with them falling out or coming too loose  3  the sound is great for the price  it s not  bose  or anything obviously  but the sound is much better than my coby earbuds and roughly equivalent to my soundbot  in short  it s balanced and clear without sounding super bass y nor tinny  4  i ve just learned today that they are very durable  i was looking all over for them and couldn t find them so i just used some other headphones and what do you know   i had tucked them in a shirt pocket and accidentally washed  and dried  them  i thought for sure they were done for  the cable even felt a little bit softer  but nope  i plugged them into my laptop and started up a video and they still worked  they didn t sound any different than before i washed    them  they were very tangled but i can live with that  overall  i would highly recommend these headphones now after giving them more of a chance myself  and  if you re like i was initially  try giving your ears a little more time to adjust  original review  november 2015   i read several reviews before buying these and got intrigued  my ears are small or shaped weird   especially my left one  i don t know what it is but i have never found ear buds comfortable  the original kind that have a hershey kiss speaker shape that goes in your ear   those are the worst  the soft in ear kind are significantly better  but still not comfortable to me and they have a tendency to fall out  i prefer regular over the ear headphones but those aren t so acceptable at work  i bought a pair of soundbot headphones that were super comfy  but after awhile the left side broke  it still works  but jiggling the wire pauses songs  skips songs  and even turns the volume up or down  which there isn t actually a control on the headphones for   wanting to find a replacement  and not be locked in to one specific brand of style   i tried these  for starters  they are cute  i mean  for ear buds  the blue is a pretty blue  it is a bit brighter than say  royal superman blue  also  they do actually stay in my ears pretty well  the ear piece sort of hooks into the shape of your ear in a similar manner as the soundbot ones  locking it in place  it isn t stuck in there however  and still relies a bit on the shove it in your ear factor  the cord is decently long  a comfortable length in my opinion  however  it is thin  i feel like it could easily have a similar problem within a few months if i don t take extra good care of them  that said  there is no control for anything on these headphones so hopefully if it started getting damaged  it would have no effect  the sound is very good  especially for the price  i have a pair of cheap  coby ear buds and the sound quality on those is noticeably lower than any others i have tried   so these are better than that  at least  these i would say are a notch below my soundbot headphones and a few notches above the coby  i would say my soundbot headphones are about on par with my original galaxy s5 headphones for sound quality  if that helps  one thing i dislike is that i can easily hear background noise through these headphones  it isn t crystal clear  but in a noisy office  i find myself having to turn the volume up further  it isn t to say that they are supposed to have noise cancel  but i got used to it with my galaxy s5 headphones and especially with my soundbot ones  galaxy s5 headphones block out the majority of background noise  and the soundbot ones block out all but the loudest  even without anything playing  they have a noise cancel effect  ok  now for my primary complaint  all other factors the same  i would be very satisfied with these headphones if they were only more comfortable  it s strange  too  because on the right ear it s perfect  on the left ear  painful  i have avoided using my galaxy s5 headphones because they aren t so comfortable to me  but i actually practically retired these ones in favor of those  i don t know what it is about my left ear  i tried switching the medium default tip for the smallest and i might say that s even less comfortable  i can t quite put my finger on it  the speaker hole is narrower   it s an oval  not a circle  giving almost an appearance like the latest iphone headphones  i thought that would have been perfect  and it is on my right ear  my right ear could probably wear it all day  but my left ear can t stand it  so  i know i have talked most this review about my broken soundbot headphones  but that s only because they are the most comfortable ear buds i have ever found  for me  comfort takes precedence over pretty much all other features  save for price  because i just can t stand wearing most ear buds  that said  here is the fib ranking  sound quality  1st 2nd  galaxy s5 and soundbot  tie  3rd  these panasonic headphones 4th  coby comfort  1st  soundbot 2nd  galaxy s5 3rd  these panasonic headphones 4th  coby appearance  1st  these panasonic headphones 2nd  galaxy s5 3rd  coby 4th  soundbot price  1st  these panasonic headphones 2nd  soundbot  by a few dollars   i can t rank the galaxy s5 because they can with my phone and the coby came as part of a set with other headphones  features functionality  1st  galaxy s5  play pause skip phone and volume  2nd  soundbot  play pause skip phone  3rd 4th  these panasonic headphones and coby  tie   no controls  overall  if my left ear wasn t so sensitive i would probably love these  because it is so sensitive  i find them almost unusable  otherwise  for the price and general quality  i would recommend them for less finicky ears 
nearly indestructible
wow is all i can say  these sound good and fit well  always stay in place  but what impresses me most is the build quality  so to speak  as a daily motorcycle rider i have stuffed numerous ear buds under my full face helmets for years  cords break  the earbud itself will come apart  the small plastic bud covers detach inside the ears  but these  i ordered two pair last year and lost one pair a few months after  i ve been using one pair only for the last several months and they are still going strong with the sound  and the materials used in making them have not been compromised  the cord is all together  the buds intact  they have been yanked  pushed  stepped on  and tied around my phone daily  they have been indestructible  i have worn much more expensive buds in the past and one thing or another has failed so far as materials and build  but these  well  i just ordered another pair to replace the black ones lost because i use them at work and the cord blends with my black uniform and gear  however the red ones ordered june 16 of last year or still a ok after almost a year of use  and sometimes abuse  nice 
but i don t like using them outside of the house because they are    
i already own alot of headphone  but i don t like using them outside of the house because they are huge and anoying to carry around   sennheiser  akg  especialy my grado those are really ugly   so i decided to buy these small little earbuds  and these panasonic earbuds sound quite good  good bass  clean sound  and they are inexpensive  they fit in your ear nicely  unlike my apple earbuds which fall out of my ears every 5 seconds  enough pros now to the cons  the cord is really thin and easily get tangle  the jack plug is pretty big and doesn t fit my iphone case  but i fixed it by cut off a little bit of rubber around the plug with a knife  and now they fit perfectly 
the ultimate bargain  cheap but quality  throw away ear buds 
i will never again pay  50 for  top rated   brand name noggin sweets ear buds ever again  these earbuds are the pure utility  throw away and don t worry sort of ear buds i always wanted but quality is not sacrificed  i use my ear buds all the time  i run and work out with them  sometimes i fall asleep listening to music with them  then of course you get tangled up in them by the time you wake up   i ve gotten them stuck on something in my backpack and gave them a good yank to free them  basically  a lot of things you really shouldn t do with ear buds and things i would be horrified to try with earbuds that cost more than these bad mamba jamas  if you want quality sound  you probably aren t looking for these and really should be perusing the senheiser and up with the audiophiles  but the sound out of these is still what i would call  really good   bass is bass and and treble is treble  to anyone who wants versatile  cheap  throw away ear buds  these should be in your shopping cart now  good sound  good comfort  good price and if you lose them or tie them in a knot  so be it  the only con is there is no integrated microphone or audio controls but that is a trade i am more than willing to accept  these are your basic barebones  ear buds  i bought two just incase i broke my first set  and after six months  i haven t opened that second pack yet 
best  9 upgrade on earth
the earpiece design stays put and is comfortable  and getting a good seal is fast and easy  i swapped out the medium tips for the large and they fit perfectly  these buds sound terrific  they are eq ed flat and warm  bass response is solid  assuming a good seal   highs are tamed  which reduces ear fatigue and facilitates higher listening volumes  bought to replace the stock buds in our sennheiser wireless in ear monitors  which these kill with ease  i even have a pair of shure se215 s that cost 10x as much  yet sound only about 25  better  and that s when you re done fidgeting with them for 10 minutes to get them placed properly in your ears for a good seal  even then  they re nowhere near as comfortable as these  incredible value 
make sure you have an air tight fit 
after reading all the reviews  i ordered these and couldn t wait to hear the awesome sound  which would validate my thrifty nature   read  cheap   when they arrived  i was really disappointed that they sounded so crappy  even though i was aware that an air tight fit was really important  i assumed that my ears would be a  medium  size  so i used the medium silicone plugs  i nearly returned them  but on a whim i tried the large size silicone plugs  wow  what a difference  suddenly my music came alive  they really are amazing for under  10  pros  amazing bass  overall really good sound  super cheap  they stay in my ears while running    they don t even come close to falling out now that i am using the large sized silicone plugs  actually quite comfortable  even with the larger plugs  so stupidly cheap  if they die    whatever  cons  red is not red    it is pink  whatever  i don t care  lots of  thudding  noises from running  oh well  no volume controls  really  panasonic  really  what would that cost  it might cost another  0 25  and i d pay another  5  sounds like a win win  but again  whatever  summary  i just bought another pair  in orange    go beavs   just in case these die  you should  too
