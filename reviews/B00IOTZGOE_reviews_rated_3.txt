basic computer and nothing more
very basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for 
hsppy eith purchase 
i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received 
okay for it s price
no good for online gaming  too bad
had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason 
when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason

everything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore
