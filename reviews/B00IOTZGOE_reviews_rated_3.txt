hsppy eith purchase 
i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received 
basic computer and nothing more
very basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for 
okay for it s price
no good for online gaming  too bad
had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason 
when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason 
great price
problems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues  monitor is rally nice for someone who has vision issues and its adjustable 
worked good for 3 months then monitor went out

just a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect 
bitter sweet
so i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbroken
computer
everything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore 
very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    
very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the price
you get what you pay for   
disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished 
good computer no manual
received by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else 
too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    
three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth

three stars

very satisfied
it is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   
three stars
pretty good for normal usage
fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection
the system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however 
it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs
it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana 
but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    
i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless 
windows xp 
the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7
