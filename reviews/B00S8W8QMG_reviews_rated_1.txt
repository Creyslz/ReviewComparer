i have 50 other monitors in our office that work fine  these are the only ones not working correctly
i purchased 7 of these monitors for our office and 5 do not work correctly  either the screen is shifted 2 inches to the right so there is black bar on the left side  or the screen was larger than the monitor so you cannot see the start bar  i have 50 other monitors in our office that work fine  these are the only ones not working correctly  i contacted support  chat only available  and was told to adjust the scaling settings on our graphics card which did not fix the problem  if i plug any other monitor in to these computers  they work fine  i know the price is cheap  but don t throw your money away  pick a different monitor 
really bad monitor  the display is so bad
really bad monitor  the display is so bad  it hurts your eyes after just 30 mins of staring at it  my laptop screen has better display quality than this monitor  returning the item immediately  also  what is the point of including dvi hdmi cable is there isn t even a dvi port on the monitor 
quit working after too late for refund
worked for awhile then quit after too late to return for refund
can t use with vesa
says vesa compatible  but the stand connector is raised on the back  making it very difficult if not impossible to use  called their tech support and they didn t even have specs on this monitor and wanted to call me back  yikes  spend a little more and get a name brand samsung  acer  etc 
not what i was expecting 
i bought one of these earlier this year for less  and it must be a difference in the year models to judge by the windows compatiblity badge  while the cheaper version was a windows 10 and bright sleek and came with all the parts the second monitor cost me more and is dimmer   not nearly as sleek a design and just overall less satisfying than the first 
the monitor delivered is not the monitor that is pictured    
the monitor delivered is not the monitor that is pictured and is completely unsuitable for my purposes  i bought this for use with a thin client that is mounted on the monitor using the vesa mount and the monitor i got can t fulfill this purpose  though the one pictured could have   this was marked as a  amazon s choice   shame on them for allowing such deceptive advertising  differences between this monitor and the one pictured  1  the vesa screw pattern is around the mounting point for the desktop stand  you can only use one or the other  since i was going to mount a small net top box to the back of it and use the monitor stand  this won t work for me  though it could have if i had received the monitor pictured   2  the video and audio inputs are not vertical and side mounted as shown  but rather horizontal and facing directly outward  3  the controls are along the back right side  not along the bottom edge as shown  4  the monitor does not use an  ac in  as shown for power  instead it takes  dc in  and uses and ac adapter  aka  wall wart   for power  5  monitor does not have a dvi input as shown and instead uses a dvi to hdmi adapter cable for this purpose  in short  the entire listing is incredibly deceptive  it s an ok monitor for the price  but if you re planning a particular purpose based on the photos then be aware that you won t receive the monitor in the pictures  it will be some other monitor that has just been given a similar model name 
don t waste your money
don t waste your money  bought it in february  it quit working this week  i emailed their customer service and haven t heard a thing from them  spend your money on more dependable hardware because this one will quit on you after a very short time 
don t buy   constantly shuts off
for starters  1 of the 2 cords included didn t even connect to the monitor in any way so not sure why it was included in the box and 2 i brought this to use once a week for when i work at home and after the 2nd week the screen constantly cuts off and on  wish i would have spent more money on a better monitor  this one will be going in the trash soon and i will have to spend money again for something that actually stays on  very disappointed    oh  i should also mention its very light weight and falls over very very veryyy easily 
not to good
lasted 2 days short of a year  screen black and power light off  never to shine again  sadly  this is the only 20  monitor i can find that has a hdmi port and fit in the custom alcove that i built
