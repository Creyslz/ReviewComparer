horrible  washed out color that was not fixable 
i had to send this one back  while i understand that you will never get two monitors to match  particularly if they were of different brands  the color on this was so washed out that it was completely unworkable  no amount of calibration by me or my it professional was able to fix it  there was no true black  only a charcoal gray  and no true white  the closest i could get was a old paper cream color  it was so distracting  i don t think i could have used it on a single monitor setup  i understand there are some serious quality control issues with this monitor  but even for a cheapo  the quality was completely unacceptable  disappointing from acer  on the plus side  amazon s tech support was excellent  and didn t make me repeat any of the things i already did before issuing a return approval 
less than optimal
i was really looking forward to this  relatively  high res monitor  but it s really not an example of proper modern engineering  i had to try several  known good  cables to get it to make pictures  the speakers are a bad joke    the bass is cut  hard  off below 1khz or so  and there s no tilt or rotation in the stand  none of which is useful unless your chair sets your eyes about 8  above the top of your desk  you re a big fan of high frequencies  and you have lots of different cables to try between your computer and the monitor   hint  dvi at the computer and hdmi at the monitor doesn t work  hdmi at the computer and dvi at the monitor does  same cable  go figure    
i really loved this monitor   perfect for an at home office    
horrible customer service  i just spent  53 to ship this back to acer because they dont provide shipping materials for warranty claims  i really loved this monitor   perfect for an at home office and paired well with my docking station and dell laptop  however  it stopped working after less than 3 months   it turns on but just gives white snow black and grey lines  awaiting contact with acer customer service to see if they will honor the warranty and if so  how complicated that process will be 
poor picture quality and limited tilt adjustment
i must have received a dud  this monitor had horrible lighting  right out of the box it was terrible  dark or black was a whitish glare  i had to view it dead on to get the best picture  if not  the edges were washed out  move off of center and bright areas mostly at the bottom  very limited tilt ability  black could not be achieved to any satisfaction  adjusting contrast and brightness couldn t solve picture quality  called acer tech support   they said its operation was normal  i suppose the heavy accented foreigner didn t understand my complaint to some degree  i opted to return it for a dell in the same price range  perfection    the dell performed perfectly out of the box  no adjustments needed 
good basic monitor while it worked
i purchased this acer g236hl bbd 23 inch screen led lit monitor for my sister from amazon on april 17  2016 after her ancient 19  viewsonic died  in october of 2017  the acer 23  monitor started not waking up from power save mode  requiring the power to be shut off and back on before it would display an image  then a few days later  it started shutting itself off randomly  it didn t seem to be linked to how long the monitor had been on  and it didn t seem to be getting hot     just shutting itself off  now  it will only display for a few seconds before powering off  and of course this happens 6 months after the warranty expires  murphy s law of crap products  i ve bought many acer products over the years  including probably 9 acer flatscreen monitors for myself and for others  and the laptop i bought my son this summer   acer aspire e 15 e5 575 33bm 15 6 inch fhd notebook  intel core i3 7100u 7th generation   4gb ddr4  1tb 5400rpm hd  intel hd graphics 620  windows 10 home   obsidian black    i ve generally been more happy than not  but this is the shortest time to monitor crap out i ve ever seen  including cheap refurbished models  one of which is still going after 10 years  i don t think i m buying any more acers 
monitor is bad after less than three months
i purchased it on in may  2015  today is july 5  2015 and the screen is already going out  if i could give no stars i would  but i can t  the monitor is actually pretty nice  it s thin and light and i like it  but the fact that this thing did not even last three months without an issue is simply wrong  can i return it   apparently not  if i wanted to return it i had to do that by june 20  2015  if you detect some anger and frustration here  you would be right 
false advertisement
when i bought this monitor it was advertised as 1920x1080p monitor but it turns out that the 19 5 in fhd monitors are actually 1600x900p which i thought was ridiculous  it was stated in the description so it was my fault but it s still unreasonable to advertise it as 1920x1080 when it isn t   for the monitor it s ok if you don t mind the color being a little bit off and the screen being small  in my opinion i don t really like the monitor so i m going to return it 
terrible color 
i bought this to replace an aging acer i ve had for a lot of years and i was disappointed with the picture quality  it had this very bright spot all across the bottom of the screen and there was no way to get rid of it  even after turning the brightness down it didn t help  the only way to make it look descent was to tilt the screen back at an angle and i didn t like that so i returned it to amazon and they quickly refunded my money  amazon is a great company to do business with
