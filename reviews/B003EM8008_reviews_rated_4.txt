panasonic rphje120k in ear headphone  great once you learn how to wear them
i ve had a love hate relationship with these earbuds until i learned how to properly use them  i ve had them for a few weeks now   these are my first pair of in ear earbuds and as many have already said  they are to be worn sealed into the ear canal to get the proper fidelity  you cannot simply fit them into the opening of the ear and get any bass response at all  i knew this but didn t know how you were supposed to get them inserted properly and i struggled in the absence of any pertinent guidance  i understand that everyone s ears are shaped a little differently but what i found that worked for me was to insert the bud into the opening of my ear canal and rotate it while applying inward pressure  kind of like turning a screw  until the cable shaft points upwards  see my pic   when the bud is situated this way it slides into my ear canal and makes the appropriate seal and i can run the cable behind my ear  no amount of inward pressure could get the proper seal with the cables hanging downward like you would think it is intended  it took me a while to figure this out  i also discovered that there is a fine line between pushing it in just enough to create the seal and pushing it in too far  go too far and they begin to hurt rather quickly    and they hurt pretty bad  so find the spot where they seal but go no further  again  it took me a while to figure this out  when positioned correctly i can wear them for extended periods  that being said  once fitted correctly   sealed in the ear canal   these buds provide an adequate  quite a bit actually  amount of bass and sound isolation compared to the regular headphones that simply rest in front of the ear opening  the bass was too much at first  i realized i had my eq settings on my device set to a high bass boost to compensate for my old headphones  once adjusted to flatten out the bass they sounded fantastic  i ve never had any other high end earbuds to compare these to but i feel that these sound great especially for the price  they do a very good job of keeping out surrounding noise  i used them on a recent flight and they did a much better job keeping out the background noise of the jet than my old phones  use caution when walking running as they can block the sound of traffic and other hazards you would otherwise hear  summary  these panasonic in ear earbuds are a great value and have exceptional sound    once you learn how to properly use them  experiment to achieve the correct and comfortable fit 
they ve worked like a charm
i purchased these headphones approximately 1 1 2 years ago and they still work  when i originally bought them i needed them as all purpose headphones which i could bring to school  use in the weight room  and use while doing work around the house  for a large portion of the time i ve had them that s exactly what i ve used them for  and they ve worked like a charm  it is important to note  however  that these headphones are all plastic  so they will take some abuse but will get damaged if the situation gets too rough   i ll touch on that a bit more later   for the price  the sound quality of these in ears is fantastic  when i let a friend use them once  he immediately responded with  whoa   for  10 earbuds the sound is very impressive and probably suitable for most people  these headphones have a balanced sound with enough clarity to deliver the basic framework of whatever music you re listening to  plus a little bit more  if you re mostly a passive listener and want cheap earbuds you won t have to worry about if they get lost or stolen  these are a great buy  when i eventually upgraded to more expensive earbuds  these ones were able still to hold a candle to the competition  although with further comparison the panasonic s are slightly  blattier  and  fuzzier  than higher quality  more expensive options  on their own  though  these earbuds sound significantly better than others in their price range  even rivaling some costing around  25  i used these earbuds as my primary listening medium for about nine months and they withstood a lot of abuse  every day i would take them to school  usually stuffing them in the smaller pocket of my backpack and carrying them wherever i went  for a long time  they stood strong  however  i pulled the buds out of my ears one day and the right side wasn t all together  in fact  the right speaker had split off from the rest of the earbud s housing  however  the wire to the speaker was still intact and after i gently snapped the two pieces back together  both earbuds worked just the same  unfortunately  i was long passed the ninety  90  day warranty for the headphones and there was nothing i could do to have them fixed  from then on  i have had to be careful when pulling the right bud from my ear  but besides that  nothing else has broken  now  these earbuds have long been replaced by more expensive ones with higher sound quality  currently  i use them as my main running earbuds  these headphones are good enough to get me in the groove  but i wouldn t be too upset if they broke  so far  they have managed fairly well despite their earlier injuries and despite being sweated on a great deal  they still work just fine and sound exactly how they did when i first got them  pros   cheap  sound great for the price  reasonably durable  ergo fit  fits very well in your ears   helps you figure out which side is which  cons   90 day warranty  plastic housing  thin shielding on the main cord the panasonic s also come with a mic and a pause play button on the cord  it s also important to mention that these headphones are in ears and fit pretty snugly in your ear  which i think helps block out sound and helps to keep the bud in place  for some people this could be uncomfortable and be a big negative for them  overall  the panasonic rptcm125 s are great sounding headphones for the price  which you can take around with you almost anywhere  they will withstand a lot of abuse but  sadly  are only covered under warranty for the first three months  recommended for the listener who wants a pair of powerful headphones for cheap  update 7 10 2015  changed my rating to better match my experience with the product 
square covered end of jack
excellent sound quality  affordable  comfortable the only downside is the pictures do not indicate the jack has a square end cover  which prevents usage in some types of cases  if you are sure the headphones will fit in your phone  these are the ones for you  they sound better than some of the  20  sony headphones 
too small for me to sleep with but good enough to use on a regular basis  they are  8  splurge 
update   while i remain positive on these very inexpensive ear buds  and they are still performing  i treat them as being fragile  the wires for instance are pretty light weight  again for the money  i consider them a good buy         for under  9 00 these panasonic ergofit in ear earbud headphones were a great buy  i have several sets of ear buds  from these  8 ones  to a range of  40 to  100  while i am not sophisticated enough to compare the specs or sound quality of high end ear buds  for  8 i was not expecting these to sound as good as they do  i sleep with a set of small ear buds every night  and use several amazon sleeping apps and albums  i want to go to sleep quickly and to stay asleep  smaller ear buds enable me to sleep on my side  using a pillow  without being conscious of them  i also don t want to wake up with irritated ear canals  if i break an inexpensive set  i would just pick up another  right now i am using a  40 set  and i dont want to toss or turn and break a  40 set  they are just a little too big for me use on a nightly basis  others may find these are fine to sleep with  i do use them throughout the week  depending on what i am listening to  or deepening on what i shove in my pocket  my daily range of music includes smooth jazz  classical  blues  country  rock  indie and pop  if i want a higher quality sound  i reach for a higher quality ear bud  in general these are acceptable  again they are only  8  there are reviews with differing opinions on whether or not they are noise canceling and other commenting about challenges to get them seated  to have them be noise canceling  i have been fortunate enough to just be able to pop them in place and they do cancel out general noise distractions  again  for  8  i would not have to think twice to buy another set  to keep them handy and to use when i inevitably misplace any one  or several sets of earbuds at the same time  consider splurging 
best earbud fit yet
i ve found every incarnation of apple s earbuds to be painful and poor fitting  after experimenting with several different 3rd party brands  these panasonics would be at the top of my list  pros  unique asymmetrical bud design fits and stays in better than anything else i ve tried  even while working out  the rubbery bud covers  the clearish part that actually sticks in your ear  stays put  other brands  i ve purchased were always falling off the headphones and getting lost  forcing you to live with the wrong size spares or replace the whole thing  very good sound  reasonably full range  though maybe a little boomy vs  tight on the bass end  i like the angled plugaccidentally yanking the cord pulls to the side and seems less likely to pull the plug straight out  also sticks out less  nice to be able to get them in something besides basic black cons   really very minor  wires seem unusually thin  even for earbuds no clip to help keep headphones coiled and less tangled when stored  this is one of the few things i like about more recent model apple earbuds 
good stuff
a bit of context first  i don t buy expensive earphones because i loose break them relatively frequently  i use headphones all the time  i listen to music on my phone daily and also use a set plugged into a bluetooth intercom system on a motorcycle  the latter has speakers  but i prefer using earbuds as they block out the background wind noise which help protect hearing at the same time allowing me to listen to music  make calls  talk to other riders and hear gps instructions while i ride  for my purpose  these headphones have been great  better sound than any other headphones i have tried in the   20 price range and good at blocking out background wind noise while i m riding  with a full face or mx goggles helmet on   the relatively low profile allows me to put on my helmet without the earbuds popping out of place and they also stay in securely while running  cycling  etc  while this will depend on the individual ear  these headphones come with three different sized ear inserts  that are well made and fit securely to the base  like with any earbud  fitment is key both to sound quality and comfort  so your bound to get a range of reviews   easy tiger   does a great job of going into detail about proper fitment  so read his review if you are struggling to get good sound out of these  i m very happy with the sound  but my expectations are also reasonable considering the fact that these are earbuds  not a  200 pair of over the ear headphones  i ve have owned more expensive earbuds  but from my recollection  not a side by side comparison   any improvement in quality of sound is marginal  at this point  my one gripe is that the insulation on the jack is to thick for my phone case making it pop out and loose the connection  to remedy this  i carefully trimmed the insulation back about 1mm around the entire jack using a utility knife which solved the problem  there is no concern about cutting the wire by doing this as that portion of the jack is still metal  whether or not that will weaken the connection of the wires to the jack remains to be seen  i will update if i have any troubles  another option is to just make the case headphone cutout larger  but i have three headphones and one one case  so i went this route  i bought three of these and will by three more when the time comes  for my use  these are the best earbuds for the money that i have tried to date 
good headphones for a small fee
these are a very inexpensive replacement for headphone mic combos that come with a mobile phone  my primary function for these is gaming on the xbox  no echo with the mic  unless accidentally blasting sound through the tv  and the volume is perfect  bass and treble are average per cheaper cellphone headphones  i recently purchased the hyperx cloud pro gaming headset due to in ear bud discomfort  and there wasn t a very large difference in sound quality  the hyperx is definitely more crisp with regards to the tone and carries about the same in bass  but other than that     not much better overall  for ten times less i d recommend the panasonic over more expensive over the ear headphone mic combos  my only gripe is the discomfort of in ear buds over a long duration of use  it must be noted that the shape of the bud is oval  not round  i don t believe this makes a large difference in comfort for me  but it may for you  if you want high quality sound from headphones i recommend doing some serious research  if you re reading this  you re already on the path   i wanted a quick fix to my previous cable ripped headphone mic combo and went with the panasonic  best headphone decision made in a while 
great sound and wonderful fit on these earbuds from panasonic at a marvelous price 
i have waited a few weeks to make sure that these panasonic in ear stereo earbuds are still working well  when i first received them i think the packaging caused them to be kinked up and i had several issues on the first three days with the sound automatically getting louder  static sounding in one ear only  and or the sound going to zero without my touching it at all  i was happy i had purchased the square trade as i thought i would be returning it  however  i am glad i waited and took my time because i am no longer having any issues with this product  i do have one thing i want to point out that the wires on the ear buds are quite thin and for some reason the connection point is l shaped  this can cause you to have the ear buds over the volume control on your fire tablet  i would prefer stronger wires and a straight connection  what i really like about this is the fact that the ear buds are ergonomic and fit in your ear quite well  i like to use mine to fall asleep to at night without waking my husband  these are very comfortable and i like that  you can purchase these in various colors but i like the basic black which i got  i do recommend you purchase the square trade for less than a dollar  because if you are anything like me  you really give them a workout  i use mine mostly when sleeping  so it is out of my control on how i treat them 
good budget option
i don t think you can beat these for durability for the price  i wear these for 3 5 hours a day for commuting and workouts  the first pair lasted 8 months before the right channel started cutting in and out  this is from the tip wearing out over time which is expected  other models in this price range would fail under heavy use as soon as a few weeks and certainly within 3 months  the sound quality is nothing to get excited about  when they are fit properly in your ears the sound is very mid range heavy almost like an old am radio and they also suppress external sound  i have no idea what the wirecutter is talking about in their review by the way  for apps with eq i cut the mids and boost the bass and treble to clear up the sound  apps that don t have eq are muddy and unlistenable  the noise suppression caused cramming an expanding earpice in your ear is disconcerting for phone calls  i find i can t hear my own voice and have to take the left earpiece out to hear myself  still for the price  this is a solid option 
good deal for the price  very basic  not for heavy or long time use i suspect 
for the price  this is a good deal  while cheaply made with very thin cords and so on  the price is fantastic  the sound is fine for listening to the news on my laptop while not disturbing others or listening to my voice messages on my phone while maintaining privacy  audiophiles will want something more sophisticated but will pay far more  one thing i like about these is that the pin you plug in is at a 90 degree angle so that when i have my laptop on its side it doesn t stick straight out and i can scoot the laptop a little onto the base i keep it on so that the pin doesn t break off  they come in a blister pack with some printed material and two extra sets of rubber ear pads  one set that is larger than the set that s installed and one set that is smaller than the installed set  there is no case or bag included  i purchased this after the earbuds included with my s5 phone began to fail after 30 months  including times when i accidentally sat on them and pulled  probably pulling on the wires in the process  plus  the plastic parts started to fall off  because i wanted to take time to find the best set of earbuds or earphones to replace them without going overboard  i decided to buy these just so i could listen privately to things until i had time to research  i decide i could tuck them into a tiny zippered plastic bag and keep it in my bag for use listening to my phone when out and about and then keep the nicer pair i get after research at home  the only reason i m giving this a 3 star rating is that these are flimsy looking and i don t expect them to last a long time  for the price  they are perfectly adequate  this would be a decent set to give to a kid prone to losing things so they can keep them in their backpack 
fastest shipping i ve ever received
i ordered these last night around 11 00pm central time and they were delivered today  sunday  before noon  what   i didn t pay for shipping  it was a prime item that was expected to arrive tuesday  i ve nerv had faster shipping on any item  amazing  anyway  i opened them and have been using them the past two hours to make sure the sound is good and i m very pleased  everything is super clear and i can hear the bass in songs and even small intricacies that i must have been missing with my last pair of ear buds  these fit my ears really well and stay in place  they also come with two more sizes of gel covers in case the originals don t fit to your liking  the length of the cord is long  which is nice  i m very happy with the earbuds  update   i removed one star from this review because the second night i used these  they stopped working on my tablet  they still work on my phone  but when i try them on my tablet  they won t work  i tried another pair on my tablet and those work fine  so i know it must be these headphones  i have no idea why they d work on both devices for a day and then the following day only work on one  i ve tried several days in a row now and they still only work on my phone  strange 
best budget earphones
wirecutter named these the best budget earbuds years ago  and i d argue they are still the best budget earbuds  under  50 in my opinion   the best rivals to these under the  50 range are earbuds available mostly in china  although they are also on amazon   ones such as xiaomi and vsonic  however  reliability on those is hit or miss  you don t want to spend  40 on a pair of earbuds end up being defective trash  so in my opinion these panasonics are pretty good  although it s hard to expect perfect build quality on a  12 item  the pairs that i ve owned have held up well  the biggest issue will be the lack of strain relief  so the part where the wire connects into the earbud is almost always likely be the cause of the demise of these earbuds  for the money they are great  if you ve got more of a budget then hifiman  shure  and the dozens of other brands recommended on head fi are the way to go 
best bang for your buck
i purchased a pair of these in december 2015  and they ve seen daily use at work ever since  office environment   listening to music  podcasts  etc    for the money  the sound quality is great  and other people can hear me loud and clear using the in line mic for phone calls  the fit in my ears is good enough that they don t fall out or get tugged out easily  however  the earbuds are now falling apart after about 1 5 years  and i need to order a new pair  for under  15  i m not complaining   these were  disposable  from day one  and i ve had  40 earbuds that have crapped out in a shorter amount of time  plus  my current ones still function  they just came apart at the gray black seam on the right earbud  mostly  i just use the right earbud so i can still hear what s going on around me  i ll try some superglue and see if i can keep them around as a backup  but i am ordering another pair of these  my four star rating has more to do with overall build quality and aesthetics compared to other earbuds i ve owned over the years  but they had to cut corners somewhere for the price  pros   price  sound quality  for the money   fit is just as good as more expensive earbuds  right angle plug  price  yep  listed twice  cons   build quality   plastic  falling apart after 1 5 years   cord tangles easily
love it 
these are by far my favorite earbuds  i ve bought these time and time again  i keep trying different companies and eventually come back to these  i use my earbuds all the time  literally every day  i throw them in my pocket and carry them with me everywhere  so basically what comes in the box is pretty standard for earbuds  the earbuds themselves  there are three different size ear bud ends  and some paperwork  pros   great sound  fit well in ears  stylish  comfortable cons   don t last very long   mine lasted on average about 3 months  however  for  6 it s unbeatable  let s go over the earbuds in more detail now  packaging the packaging was nothing special  just a standard plastic case  the ones that are a pain in the ass to open  it took me about 2 minutes just to open the box  however  it s not the box  but what s in the box that matters  build quality build quality wise  these earbuds seemed ok  the wire was fairly thin but unless you where pulling on it  it doesn t seem like the wire would give way  the 2 earpieces themselves are made of plastic  once again  it doesn t seem that the plastic would break unless you abuse the crap out of these earbuds  as for the headphone jack  i like how instead of having it go straight it turns  so if you rest your phone on the jack  it won t wear off the wire joint  comfort these earbuds are quite comfortable  i wore them for about 5 hours straigh before i started feeling pain on the inside of my ears  i also like how well they actually fit in your ears  they don t feel like they re hanging out of you ears  they feel like they are in your ears  so if you wanted to go for a jog with these earbuds  i don t think it would be a problem  sound the sound is very good  it isn t going to blow your mind  but they do sound very good for the price  i use them for listening to music all the time and i enjoy every second of it  summary in the end  i would recommend these to anyone  they are good earbuds  i have purchased these earbuds 3 times now  and i will probably be back again soon  if you found this review helpful please click the helpful button  i appreciate it 
good for short term usage
i ordered these in orange and later in purple because panasonic is a decent brand in my opinion  the headphones arrived in about 7 days in a box neatly coiled and ready for use  also in the box were 2 extra pairs of ear bud cover replacements  one pair was the same size as the ones that com with the headphones and the other pair is a bit smaller  i m not sure why considering they re meant for those headphones  i used these everyday for music while i worked out  i gave these headphones 4 stars because after a few weeks  one side stopped working  it may have been due to how i coiled them because other than that  there was no water damage on my part  unless they short out due to heavy use  i ordered the second pair soon after and one side went out on them as well  but you get what you pay for 
don t buy if you want high quality sound
summary  these are horrible headphones and i would suggest you look elsewhere  after reading the many great reviews on here  i decided to give these headphones a try  since i was traveling and wanted something simple  i tried to like these earphones  i even tried the various sized rubber inserts  i adjusted the volume on the various devices i used it on  overall despite the brand name  these sound like  2 headphones from china  the issues i had were  1  i had to really crank up the volume to get any kind of decent sound  the drivers just aren t very sensitive  2  too much midrange and not enough highs and lows  my guess is that the design of these headphones forces sound through a tiny hole that get routed into the ear canal  sound that have the resonant wavelength for this size hole would be amplified  while highs and lows would be attenuated  3  the rubber inserts were uncomfortable  the design forces the inserts deep inside your ear canal  this makes the inside of your ears itch  so i don t think i can wear these for hours on end  i would prefer the older foam style that fits on the outside of your ear canal  4  audio just sound faint and distant  i never get the feeling that i am right in the action  in conclusion  these are not sennheiser so don t expect quality  they remind me of some jvc headphones i got once on an impulse buy because they were cheap  i have owned many fine panasonic products so i was initially quite surprised at the low quality  in contrast  my 10 year old 720p panasonic tv still looks better than most newer tvs   the only use i can imagine for these headphones is if you want something to fall asleep to  like comedy or talk radio but not music  and don t want to risk breaking good headphones  due to finding them under you the next morning  then these might suffice  i have broken many good headphones this way  so i won t mind when these panasonics headphones break   i got the white ones  in case it makes any difference  update  i have had this for 5 months now  i use it almost every day for video editing  mostly voice  sometimes intro music  and falling sleep to internet radio  it has started to grow on me   maybe i have forgotten what good headphones sound like   i rate the sound quality to be adequate to good  i haven t really intentionally abusing it    just use it normally  sometimes i find it crushed under me  between me and the bed in the morning  so far it has been quite sturdy  so upping to 4 stars from original 2  the one thing that i still do not like is that it goes deeper into the ear than traditionally earbuds  so sometimes my inner ears gets itchy after prolong use  also  it blocks out more sound that traditional earbuds  due to the compressible rubber inserts  which are quite soft and generally pretty comfortable  this seems by design for noise isolation purposes  so sometimes i have to remove the headphones to have a conversation  or to check to see if the phone is really ringing  knocking one star for these quirks  otherwise pretty good headphones for the price  will update again if when it breaks 
good enough  but not miracle headphones
don t believe the people who say this has good bass  i was hoping the people who said otherwise were just being picky  i m no audiophile  but these have less bass than the  3 xaiomi in ear piston headphones i had last  meaning you can t feel the bass at all  but the sound isn t tinny  i mostly bought these because people said they re durable  but first impression is  the cord feels thin and cheap  so i m not so sure about that  but i can t judge  i ll update my review later with my long term thoughts  the earbuds themselves are reasonably comfortable  and they stay in very snugly  they block out a lot of noise so you can t hear surrounding background noise  which is a plus  final thoughts  these are good enough for the price since i needed new headphones quickly  but i ve gotten much better ones for much cheaper by waiting around for deals to show up 
    have previously ordered panasonic ergofit earbuds and have always liked the feel and comfort of them so i ordered    
i have previously ordered panasonic ergofit earbuds and have always liked the feel and comfort of them so i ordered these for the microphone  the microphone works pretty well  other people have told me they can hear me clearly but it does pick up movement noise so i have to try to not move the cord while on the phone  i was hoping there would be volume buttons on the microphone button as well but there is only one  to answer and end calls
