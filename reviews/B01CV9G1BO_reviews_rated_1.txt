the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  bad
hp 8300 elite
this pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refund
bad enough the cover was broken
run away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10
bad impression
the certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore 
shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboard
shipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified 
so very disappointed 
i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated 
do not buy if you want it to last more than a year
i cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again 
bsod
1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me 
good luck trying to figure this out with hp
the system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk 
do not buy 
i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would 
i can t even change wallpaper
the key is not activated do not buy this      
the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    
hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well
