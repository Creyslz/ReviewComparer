the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  bad
so very disappointed 
i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated 
hp 8300 elite
this pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refund
bad enough the cover was broken
run away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10
bad impression
the certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore 
shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboard
shipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified 
do not buy if you want it to last more than a year
i cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again 
slower than my 5 year older computer
i bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t

1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me 
good luck trying to figure this out with hp
the system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk 
do not buy 
i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would 
i can t even change wallpaper
the key is not activated do not buy this      
the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    
hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well 
not much to look at   
this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 
so both are now useless to me
recieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi 
had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    
had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping out  i will never buy refurbished computers again 
buyer beware
received this computer 30 days agao and it worked for 2 weeks then went dead  buyer beware 
arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet    
arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet   system locks up when two or three windows are open   constantly  re start   fristrated  cd dvd drive is  junk    ruined two or three discs   just grinds  will not trust another refurbished system  
arrived damaged   
it arrived poorly packaged and damaged both visibly  and in such a way that i could not open the case to install my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointed
this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    
this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion 
froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginning
in the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher 
i should have known better
i realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape 
did not work
the product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out 
i guess they don t qa there product
the computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite 
so very disappointed in getting help
i have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    
was not pleased with this computer purchase

hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   
not what i ordered
at least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned 
didn t work
didn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned 
seems like they should have tested it
didn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it 
arrived doa
doa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund 
lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable 
i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included

disappointed 
i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how to fix the issue all of which failed

wouldn t load and operate right out of the box had to return it the same day i received it
better to buy new than throw your money away here 
i bought this on oct 11 2017 and it has been used gently  today  jan  11  2018  the entire system is gone  do not waste your money or buy from this company  buyer beware

don t trust  certified rebuilt 
there hard drive had to be replaced immediately in order to get the computer to work properly  6 months after purchase we have  500 in repairs for driver issues  finally thew it away  i would have never bought this machine if knew it was rebuilt and certified by a third party other than hp

wrong computer 
wrong computer  ordered it  because it said windows 10 and ethernet wireless  computer came with neither  had windows 7 pro no wireless connection  after adding wireless  got an error message 671     would not connect to internet  after 3 hrs of trying to connect  boxed it up and sending it back  also the cord keeps falling out and computer would shut down   ggggrrrrr  positive side  case was excellent  came boxed in heavy duty plastic case  box was a little damaged  with no harm to computer  if i could have connected to internet  i probably would have kept the computer  i like windows 7

have to send it back
you would think the term  certified refurbished  would mean they actually plugged it in to see if it works  mine is stuck in an error message  customer support line is always busy and they never answer any emails  i will have to send it back  just noticed the 1tb is cheaper than the 500 gb i bought

will go to best buy or some place and buy new from now    
doesn t work  don t ever buy a refurbished hp  lesson learned  will go to best buy or some place and buy new from now on 
you know they could let you know that it didnt come with everything so you would know so you could get it beforehand thats so rude and stupid it really pisses me off
okay every time i buy something refurbished it doesnt work right or not work at all in the first place it didnt come with wifi you needed a cord i paid a tech to come out and set it up twice because he had to get the right cords and wifi it worked when he was here my wife turned it on this my all it had was a blue screen so i called amazon they tried to fix it and couldnt so i called hp support they said i had the wrong number so then i called the seller they didnt answer wanted me to leave a message you have to understand we are into 2 hours now and nothing so im sending this piece of crap back  im telling you dont buy
we went out and purchased an adapter from best buy for  39
we were very surprised to see that the computer did not come with a wireless adapter  we went out and purchased an adapter from best buy for  39  but this was very inconvenient  suggest this  lack of a  feature be more clearly stated   as it has left this particular customer dissatisfied  in today s day and age   this is like selling a car without tires
