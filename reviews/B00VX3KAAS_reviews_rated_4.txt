great monitor once you use the tilt feature
i felt a bit sorry for this monitor on amazon taking all this heat from a lack of tilt and i m here to set the record straight  i purchased this product at a black friday event where i was only looking for 3 features within my price range  1  full hd 2 led 3 22    when lined up with other products  this one stands out in terms of specifications and price  once home  it connected to both my blue ray player and computer with ease  the quality from blue ray is outstanding with a high speed hdmi  dvi cable  the only issue was the lack of tilt  for the first few days i was stacking reams of paper to get a proper height adjustment and to obtain the optimal viewing angle  how could acer make a high tech monitor with no tilt   answer  they did  having been spoiled for the past 20 years with easy tilting built into every computer screen encountered  this acer requires you pop off the stand  and with a screw driver and wrench  tweek the stand frame to your desired angle and retighten  easy  it takes less than 3 minutes  this is a fantastic buy  the quality is as advertised  and if your video card supports two monitors  buy a second one for a full panoramic experience  i hope you enjoy 
trade offs  but worth the price
this would be 5 stars except some build quality issues  others have mentioned it  but at the bottom corners there is a gap between the frame and screen where you can spot a bit of back light  it isn t noticeable unless you look for it  but at first i thought the monitor was damaged  another reason for 4 stars vs 5 is the hidden bezel  there is a gap on the left and right side and top of the monitor  i spent an hour trying to figure out if i needed to overscan until i found other videos and reviews showing the same gap  so even though this has a very thin frame  there is still a hidden bezel  if you want that true edge to edge display you d need to go with dell or something similar and that s a lot more expensive  a trade off to keep in mind if that s important to you  disclaimer  i m not a designer  photo editor  just a sys admin  this is my primary monitor for work  the screen quality of this monitor relative to its price is amazing  i think it actually rivals the quality you get with dell ultrasharps  the matte screen has nearly 0 reflection and i m using it in an upstairs office that gets direct sunlight  i think the slightly smaller size helps with the picture quality as the pixel density is that much greater  i have a 27  hp zr2740w next to it and this monitor outshines it hands down  it ships with several cables  something i haven t seen in a long time  high speed hdmi  display port to display port  and dvi  at least  30 in cables out of the box  i m using the hdmi cable to connect my dell inspiron 7000 2 in 1 7348  i get 2560x1440 60hz with no issues  i have tried a myriad of adapters and cables with my hp monitor  which only has dual link dvi and displayport  and have never been able to get 1440p from this laptop  i was actually surprised this worked out of the box as i don t think the 7348 has hdmi 2 0  i won t be playing any games on this at the moment  but i do have a xps 15 9550 coming next week  it won t be able to push 1440p with very high settings but i ll probably try battlefront and cities skylines  you also lose a good stand  the one this comes with allows you to pivot the monitor  there is no side to side  up or down  also no vesa mount  although there are adapters for about  30  the stand is sturdy and the monitor light and compact so it s easy to fit on a smaller desk  i m including a pic of the gap and you can see the hidden bezel from the other pic  my 7348 has a glossy screen to get an idea of reflection 
excellent display  mediocre stand  some minor deficiencies
i had been using the lg 2342p passive 3d monitor and i have been a gamer of mostly older titles  crysis 3 being my most recent purchase  and i really enjoyed the 3d aspect and enhanced it further with real 3d glasses  yet it was a major compromise not being adequate to do my photography editing and i had to buy a separate laptop  also the textures suffered and dynamic shadows often did not work well  i moved furniture one day and it fell over and smacked the edge of the desk and that was that  i am quite amazed by the transition from 1080p to 1440 p even on a 25  monitor in sharpness and clarity  also the difference from a cheap ips panel to a higher level ips panel is a breath taking true color reproduction  i am not missing the 3d aspect too much because of the visual feast  really the colors look true to life when i did a youtube video test at 1440p hd and the black levels are really great unless your entire screen is black and there was really minor back light bleeding at 80  brightness the screen is matte so even on a sunny day the reflection and glare is kept to a minimum  i was concerned that moving to 1440p would directly impact my gaming performance and the ips issue of ghosting  i can say  although fps peepers might not be as satisfied  that crysis 3 at the highest settings with 4x anti aliasing and 8x anisotropic filtering has not affected my gaming experience in the least  i have a skylake i5 6500 quad core  8 gigabytes of ddr4 ram  a r9 380 2 gigabyte card  a 650 watt corsair power supply  and running windows 10 off a 3 year old sata 500 gigabyte drive  nothing is overclocked  since i can t with an non k processor  d oh    everything really pops and shadows are so much deeper to provide a much more ambient experience  there are cut scenes of rendered video that has minor blurring but everything else seems fine  photographic editing has been a wonderful experience  working in windows 10 does require me to increase the icon size a bit so some might want a 27  at 1440p  i prefer the sharpness and it not taking up a lot of desk space  my only cons  it is not vesa compliant  the stand only tilts but does not adjust in height  it feels like they cut corners in the overall construction with mostly plastic  what do you expect at this price    and osd menu is tricky to navigate  although i do like the 6 axis saturation adjustment  no usb or other ports  no vga connection since vga cannot support the native resolution of this monitor anyway  it is not exactly  borderless   there is the variant of this with a better looking stand  still only tilts  but with an identical screen and was selling for about  90 more  not worth it in my opinion  this is an excellent and economical choice of a really good 25  16 9 60 hz wqhd 1440p screen for gamers like me and not fraggers  120 hz and above tn panels  and with a pretty accurate color gamut and gray scale out of the box which is also great for photo and video editing  it s a gorgeous screen  if it had height adjustment and a less cumbersome osd interface  i would have given it 5 stars 
may seem an excellent value  but note some inconsistencies and failure after 14 months
this a great monitor for the money  see update below 2 15 17   i bought 2 of them to be used together as an extended desktop for my windows pc at their native 2560x1440 resolution  the images are sharp and clear  and it performs as advertised  the  zero frame  design is nice when putting the two side by side  but unless there are settings i am unable to find  there is still about a 1 4  gap from the edge of the image to the frame  the stand allows you to adjust the angle of tilt but it seems they are not built consistently  each have rubber pads at the ends of their  x shaped  legs that you expect would hold them steady against your desk  for mine  one stand sits nice and flat on my desk  making the monitor sit solidly in place  for the other stand  some of the rubber pads do not make contact with the desk  so the monitor wobbles more easily but also rotates unnecessarily  another potential negative  which may be a big one for some people  is the lack of vesa mounting  i am not sure why any modern monitor would lack this  but be warned if that is something you need  there are stand adapters available  such as this one from gladiator joe gladiator joe acer adapter for s240hl  s232hl  s242hl series   you can check out their website for others if you don t find one for your monitor here  for me  it is not an issue  because i don t need the desk space occupied by the stands  and the slight irritation of the inconsistency of the stands does not impact me  my desk is built into my wall  so it doesn t matter how hard i type  the monitors are not budging  i would have no hesitation to buy another  especially at this price  if i get ambitious and want to run three at a time  if it wasn t for the lack of vesa mount  the inconsistency of the stands  and the 1 4  gap around the image  i would rate this monitor 5 stars  update  2 15 2017 one of the two monitors began displaying vertical stripes across the screen a few months ago  see attached photo   they are very thin vertical lines  so although they are very annoying  i can still use the monitor for basic web browsing and just about anything where the background is white  like ms word docs   the stripes are prevalent where colors are being displayed  i was not sure if it was my video card or the specific video input i was using on the monitor  so  the first thing i did was swap with my other monitor  which is still working correctly  and the stripes were still there  showing that it is not my video card  which is a relief  i also tried changing video inputs on the monitor  but the stripes did not go away  so  the monitor is undoubtedly defective and  of course  there is no chance of returning it  the stripes are definitely annoying  and i will ultimately want to replace the monitor and will not purchase another acer monitor 
pretty good with a few issues
i picked up my old monitor using two hands to move it out of the way  pulled the new monitor out of the box and thought i d grabbed cardboard  it was so light  plugged it in  fired it up  and it was bright  bright  bright  it also looked huge next to my 19 inch second monitor  spent 30 minutes cursing and grumbling trying to figure out the out of sight button on the bottom of the screen to lower the brightness and adjust the contrast  i think i ve got it adjusted now  not thrilled with the stand  if it s supposed to lock in there  i haven t figured out how  it s wobbly  but since i don t have to touch it  i guess it s ok  i ve got the tilt adjusted for work  where i sit up  but when watching a video  i lean back in my chair and it gets a bit dark  i am confused that my old 19 inch monitor seems to have sharper colors  this one s resolution is better  but not as crisp  all in all  i ll probably get another one to replace the 19 inch eventually 
great monitor for gaming
i have this monitor since april 2016  i love this monitor so far  mine has no dead pixel and almost next to none bleeding effect  i can play ffxiv max setting at 50 60 fps  rainbow six siege max setting and 90 fov setting at over 100 fps  the picture is beautiful and max resolution is really great  i like the appearance design of the product  it feels slick and modern  only one down side i have is that there is no height adjustment and only tilt adjustment but i don t mind that  summary pro   considered the max solution and price  it s great product for what you pay for it    easy set up  no hassle    on a long gaming session  it doesn t generate that much heat  con   no height adjustment  only tilt  if you want height adjustment you want to buy a mounting kit    very minor  more like my petpeev  i have my setup in the bedroom and when my pc is off and monitor shut down  the led kept flashing due to there s no signal and it s on standby mode  i would rather have it on solid orange led like most of other monitor than flashing led since it s very noticeable in the dark room when i go to bed  no big deal  i usually turn off the monitor all together  the one star is taken off due to height adjustment mostly  there s no real con aside from that  i don t want to be a bias and give it five stars
a decent monitor for it s price 
this is a decent monitor for the money that i gave for it  this is a very bright monitor  i had to turn the monitor brightness down to 10 and the contrast was turned down to 40 i then went into my nvidia control panel and selected the  use nvidia settings  for the desktop color settings  i then turned the brightness and contrast down in the nvidia control panel as well  i finally got those settings down to acceptable levels  i did the same thing for video color settings  i enabled the use nvidia settings option and was able to adjust the settings there to my liking for steaming movies  i knock one star off because the video driver is a generic one that was installed by windows 10  it is dated 2006  some of the monitors built in menu functions don t work  i suspect that they don t work because of the old generic driver  it appears that acer is not supporting this monitor anymore  they have a windows 8 driver for this monitor but i was unable to get it to work with windows 10 
if you have a bad sense of touch
acer g277hl abid 27 inch full hd  1920 x 1080  widescreen display no complaints  when researching  i saw some people complained about the control buttons on the front right bottom of the monitor  there are no pictures indicating where the buttons are and they are very small  i ve been using it for a couple of weeks and still have to feel around for the tiny buttons  i have to put my finger to the far right and drag it along so i hit the first  power  button  i left some of the plastic shipping protection on the monitor and sometimes i confuse that for the button  that s how small they are  i still frequently hit the second button from the right  if you have a bad sense of touch  big fingers or are clumsy  you might find it difficult to find the right button  i don t think it s an issue for most people  i don t take any stars off because of it  i bought this for  139 99  at full price  i think this is only 4 stars because there are other similarly priced 27  monitors  if you can get this on sale  it s worth it  most other monitors with similar prices to what i paid were 23   i went big and don t regret it 
nice screen for a good price  but if you re getting a g276hl model  keep in mind that it does not have hdmi port 
very nice screen  and very bright too  maybe even too bright  one thing everyone definitely needs to do is click the menu button on the front panel and adjust this screen s brightness and contrast  mine came with 100  setting for both and by the time i got to a comfortable setting i had both at 25   seriously  so please do so  otherwise the screen is too bright  other than that  there s only one complaint for whoever may be affected by it  g276hl model   this screen does not have an hdmi input  if you rely on it  for my case  i could use a standard dvi  white  plugin to connect it to my desktop  so no problem there  the screen is very light in weight  it has almost no bezel  the bezel is less than half of an inch on each side   the screen comes with an external power supply  in a shape of a small  brick   but it is not a problem to stick it underneath your desk  so for the price  i would definitely recommend it 
great monitors for the price 
i purchased 3 wqhd ips  2560 x 1440  9 months ago and i can tell you i don t regret the purchase  okay maybe slightly but only because i did not pay attention if they were capable of being mounted so its my own fault in the end  when i received them i was actually surprised to find none of them had dead pixels  9 months down the line and they are still holding strong  if you want an affordable 1440p monitor for gaming this is perfect  i m likely to move onto something different within the year but i m glad i purchased these  so two things to point out  1  no vesa mount capability 2  it has speakers but they are horrible  its made for gaming so they don t expect you to use them anyway 
doesn t have an hdmi port but works for me  great price 
i was actually a little surprised that this monitor did not have an hdmi port given that it s current technology  yes  it clearly states that it does not have one but i just assume most technological items these days have an hdmi port so please be aware that this one does not have one  don t worry though you can easily buy a cable that converts to an hdmi cable so i suggest checking different cables out because they are quite cheap  i think this is a great monitor for the price  the base is compact but i found that it sits a little low  i have another acer monitor that is a higher end model that is much taller than this one so in order for me to make them the same height i have to raise this monitor by placing it on school book  you might want to check out the height measurements if you are buying this monitor to be a second or third monitor  no complaints really  it s definitely not as clear as my led monitor but it s still really nice quality  i use it as a second monitor 
it s an excellent monitor for the price
pro   the screen is big  you have enough room for opening multiple windows   the image is sharp  if you look at the pictures in the right resolution of course   the color is fantastic   easy to set up   good viewing angle  colors  especially white color  don t get washed out pinkish when viewing in angle except black color   con  like most led monitors  the black color get washed out  if you watch the monitor in a well lighted room  then you wouldn t really notice it  if you turn off all the light in the room  you can see the black color around the screen lit up  the background led light is so bright that you can even read a book   only 60hz which is not ideal for 3d glasses   cannot adjust height   cannot turn the screen left and right   cannot rotate the screen  if you want to view in portrait mode  then you will need a special stand to hold it  even this is 4m respond time  i dont really notice ghosting image when playing fps games  overall  this is a great monitor  it may not be on the top list but you can t beat the price  keep in mind  1080p is still being widely used  most of the movies and tv shows you download from the internet  1080p is usually the best quality you can find  watching 1080p movies tv on 1440 monitor may lose a little picture sharpness in full screen mode  also  going from 1080 to 1440 require better graphic power  especially in gaming  and lastly  when you first turn on the monitor  you will notice everything become so much smaller  for some people  you may not get used to it  so think about it before upgrading from 1080 to 1440 monitor 
not bad    good price 
decent monitor  you do get what you pay for with the price  i use autocad as a draftsman and this monitor is adequate for that however someone doing serious graphics may want to look elsewhere  text is a little fuzzy and the color distorts at the slightest shift of viewing angle  the overall image appears to be slightly pixelated  the stand is a bit rickety also  the display is pretty shaky on the stand that it comes with  any slight movement or even someone walking by my desk causes the monitor to shake  i would suggest purchasing wall or desk mount to add stability  no hdmi but that is not a big deal to me  you have to realize when you buy this that it is not a high end monitor  i works well for gaming and movies  netflix  amazon prime  etc   look pretty good  overall a decent budget friendly monitor 
impressed by the value  but you do get what you pay for  
this is a great buy  it s decent 1440p at the lowest price you ll find  i use it for design work alongside my 15 inch macbook with retina display  it s great for productivity  and i like the extra real estate  but i think i ll be using my macbook for photo editing or color sensitive work  this monitor runs a little warm  color wise  but can be calibrated to a fairly neutral level  blacks are alright  but look dull in comparison to the retina display i have next to it  that s fine and for the most part  the monitor looks great  and works for my purposes  now for quality control issues   i did not receive a monitor with any dead pixels  and my backlight is reasonably balanced  you can check this by viewing a total black image in full screen  i ve heard of cases of blotchiness or uneven backlighting  but mine is passable  the issue i do have  however  is with light leak around the edges of the screen  it s very apparent that corners were cut in the production of this product  i ve included pictures of the frame where you can see the apparent light leaks  this is not too much of a problem if i view the monitor straight on  but they are there  and i fear they will only grow in size if the frame is not properly affixed to the edges of the screen  the other issue is the stand  i know everybody is complaining about vesa mounts  but to be honest i barely even know what those are  i m happy with the placement of the monitor on my desk  but the stand is weak  it s so weak  the entire monitor is jiggling as i type this review  i ve tightened my screws  but the base and stand just aren t heavy duty enough  i d attribute this to lightweight plastic  or maybe just poor design engineering  anyways  that s about it  i use it for graphic design  and things look great  but am still hesitant to trust the colors on this guy  i also use it with my ps4 and my games look better than ever  though that s easy since i m not demanding color accuracy   i d pick this up if you re mostly interested in a great looking monitor and some extra screen real estate  especially if you re using a laptop 
great monitor at a great price with one slight drawback
this is a great monitor at a great price  the screen is bright and sharp  at least using a dvi cable  it s good for both daily work and watching streaming video  the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it s not easy to adjust the tilt angle  and the manual says nothing about it  the only way i knew it could be adjusted was because of another reviewer  here s how to adjust it  1  before you mount the screen  take the stand arm and remove the 2 flathead screws that are tucked up inside  not the 2 near the bottom  using a philips screwdriver  2  you can now remove the metal angle adjusting bracket and place it in a vice or use locking pliers to hold it  3  loosen the nut on the inside of the bracket with a 10 mm wrench and move the bracket the other way  4  put everything back together  5  mount the monitor on the stand arm and the stand arm on the base  tighten the screw on the bottom of the base  the monitor should now be tilted back slightly for a more comfortable viewing angle  one more thing that s nice to know but is not included in the product description  the monitor comes with both dvi and vga cables  i expected the vga cable but did not see the dvi cable listed  mac users with a mini displayport  thunderbolt  will need a mini displayport to dvi adapter 
fantastic monitor for the price
jumped from a 4 5 year old cheap 1080p monitor to this  and i m really satisfied with the upgrade  the ips panel is much more sharp and clean than my older monitor  the colors are so vibrant on this thing that it took me a while to realize that the monitor s color settings weren t off and that my previous monitor was so dull that the shock of switching to the ips panel needed some time to wear off  surprisingly  this is also a pretty decent monitor for gaming  4ms isn t really the fastest for gaming  but there s very minimal ghosting  sometimes none at all  and turning on vysnc in game feels serviceably responsive  attempting to overclock the monitor to 75hz  which this monitor is rated for  creates a lot of ghosting and rendering issues overall  but there are also some reviews i ve seen where people have successfully hit 75hz without any issues  so your mileage will vary  only issues i have with this is that the stand is wobbly and pretty cheap  but serviceable enough  also  it appears that most models also have this minor issue  but there s definitely going to be some backlight bleed on the corners  it s really only noticeable if you re screen is rending a darker color  and is actually pretty negligible and acceptable  not to mention that if you re running windows 10  you are not going to have any success using the displayport ports  so keep that in mind if you re interested in running more than one of these  edit  i sort of just parroted what was said about the displayports being dysfunctional on windows 10  but i gave it a shot anyway and so far i haven t had any flickering issues that have been described with other reviews  using a gtx 1070 with the monitor  if that helps  edit 2  going 3 weeks strong on this monitor using the displayport inputs  haven t had any of the previously mentioned issues i expected with windows 10 and this monitor 
worth it if on sell
i got the 24 in ips monitor on sell for 130 dollars  not bad compared to the other monitors around this aspect  the monitor has built in speakers in it too which i didn t know til i looked at my speaker options  they are not the best speakers but after awhile you get used to it  not very loud either  but that isn t too much of an issue really  the display is wonderful  one of the things i hate about other monitors is how big the monitor is and how smaller the display screen is compared to the full size  this has very low bridge break on the edges which makes this a great set for multiple display look  i did saw on other reviews not just this monitor but with the other ips ones of the back light issues when the screen is on but on a black screen  i haven t really noticed it at all really  maybe once when i first plugged it in to see what the people where talking about  in the end  i haven t really noticed it at all with video games or movies in either light or dark room  but then again each monitor has a chance to be worse than the other batches  the only reason why i am giving this a four star is because the only issue i have is eye strain  i work with computers for my job all the time and i rarely or get used to looking at plasma screens and such  i am still new with the ips type even though it has been out since 1996  so i thought i should try it  it is a good monitor but has flaws to it  flaws like if you look at it in an angle instead of straight ahead could cause your eyes to be confused over time and also some ghosting with fast moving pictures  with this monitor i only experienced the first  i won t recommend this for gaming or movies  only for designing or working  only because longer game play could really hurt your eyes   other than all that i do like this and believe acer is very good at making great monitors  if you have more money to spend  find a 4k display monitor 
so far  so good
this does just what i needed   using it as a second screen for both my work  pc  laptop and personal  mac  laptop    i can alternate between computers using an input selection button on the monitor  and if one computer is not running  the monitor will auto select over to the running machine  the picture is clear and colorful  and it s a good size for both writing documents and doing photoshop work  the only negatives i can think of would be the lack of hdmi connection and the inability to adjust the height  it is possible to tilt the monitor  though  which is helpful  all in all  for the price  this works great for me 
1920x1080  1600x900  what is it really 
bought this acer g206hql 19 5  led monitor w 16 9 format to replace my hp 19  w1907 which is not 16 9 format  still getting used to the difference  think i like the hp better  4 stars not 5 because the style specified in the ad says  full hd 1920 x 1080  and does not reconcile the difference between that and the resolution of 1600 x 900 
good  cheap monitor  27  version vesa compatible 
i was looking for a second monitor that roughly matched the dimensions of my other acer monitor   an xf270hu   but one that wouldn t overdrive my graphics card too much  this fit the bill perfectly  27   borderless  vesa compatible  1080p and 60hz  since it s my secondary display  it s not as important to me to have a high resolution or fast refresh rate  i game on my main monitor and use this one for discord  youtube  reddit  etc  it looks very nice on my desk  my only real gripes are that the power cable is proprietary  i was wanting to use an extended  standard power cable for cable management  and the fact that the display doesn t come with an hdmi cable  who still uses vga for home video purposes 
great product  horrible assembly 
ok so i never write reviews  but i just thought this might help some people out  i just moved and i was pretty bummed because i got really used to working with an additional monitor  and my new institution didn t have extra monitors lying around like my previous one  so i shopped around eventually found this monitor and it was a great deal for the size  so i ordered 2   one for home  one for campus  two days later  thanks to prime   i get them in the mail  and i start to unbox one and realize i underestimated how big 23  was  and i was impressed that they included the dvi cord  not that i had any need for it  along with the vga and power cords  the monitor assembly comes in 3 pieces  the monitor  the connector  and the stand  and this is why you only see 4 stars up there  the connector actually has a few pieces but i ll focus on the metal piece that actually connects to the monitor  originally i tried to just connect it to the monitor while it was all assembled  but it wouldn t just snap in place like it look likes its designed to    to save a lot of time  because you probably dont waste anymore time reading this and my girlfriend want me to go grocery shopping  long story short  i ended up having to take the connecter apart then use a hammer and a screwdriver with no bit as a hard small blunt surface to force the metal tabs into place  also you have to take it apart to adjust the tilt   i hoped that was just the problem with the monitor i had purchased  but remember i had two  and unfortunately the second one took as much force to put together  assembling the rest was a breeze and once i had i hooked up it look amazing next to my little 13  laptop  overall its a nice monitor  so far  but i think the assembly process might be why the monitor is so affordable 
great monitor to use for extreme gaming 
great monitor to use for extreme gaming  not many of them out there to achieve this quality of detail and resolution at this price range  i don t know if this is a hidden feature of the monitor  but it is natively displayed at 60hz and appears to support 85 with my gtx 1080ti  i don t know if that little piece of information helps anyone at all  but i have had no issues with gaming at 85fps  why the 4 stars  you would think that at  250  you would at least be given a product with a sturdy stand  especially for a monitor  but this is not the case  this thing wobbles every time i move at the desk  even something as simple as pushing pulling the keyboard  i currently have placed my dbx 286s on the stand legs to help alleviate some of the annoyance that this has produced  good to know my equally expensive mic preamp doubles as a heavy weight 
great monitor  some possible confusion 
this monitor is great  but i want to set the record straight about a couple of things  firstly  this is an led monitor  it says lcd on the description on amazon  but it s led  secondly  it seems some people might be confused about this monitor s features  it does not come with any hdmi ports  and it outputs no sound  you need speakers  it s a monitor  not a tv  and it s meant for use with computers  the thing is  you should take any reviews by customers who give this product a bad score only for this reason with a grain of salt  they didn t look up the specs  and that s their own fault  it states clearly and specifically  no hdmi   i mention it in this review just in case some people might miss that important piece of info  but it is definitely in there for you  don t give a good product a bad score because you couldn t take the time to read if it has what you need or not  i admit it seems odd that in 2015 any monitor wouldn t have any hdmi in ports when most computers have hdmi output either via the motherboard or graphics card  but computers will also have outputs for the ports on this monitor  dvi d sub  this is not for use with consoles  unless you have an adapter to covert hdmi to dvi  you can get one of those on amazon for about as much as an hdmi cable  and it s something that you ll actually need rather than an hdmi cable  the monitor also comes with one dvi cable and one d sub cable the reason i bring this up is because amazon is suggesting the purchase of an hdmi cable with this monitor because they re apparently frequently purchased together  which is hilarious  4 5 stars for this product because the blacks aren t very deep and the stand is a little too wobbly for a monitor that is this thin and light  but this monitor is extremely thin and light  it has a super thin bezel and sharp 1080p display at 60hz  which means if you re looking for 1440p or 4k  or playing games at higher than 60fps this isn t the monitor for you  the 6ms response time isn t the best compared to other monitors  but this isn t a pro gaming monitor  and it s a way better response time than what you d get on a tv  it s a fantastic product  it suits my needs just fine  and i would suggest it to anyone who could use it  but you should know what you re getting into just in case no hdmi ports and no built in speakers are deal breakers for you 
a great screen  i wouldn t go back 
this is a perfectly good monitor  and an excellent value for the price  the resolution is 1920x1080  not having an hdmi cable  i have to use a vga connector  and i expect the video quality will be superior with the hdmi cable  at this resolution  the print size is small  and you have to try and make it bigger using the ordinary windows methods  unless you like the font size  there was some dissatisfaction with the angle adjustment of the screen provided by acer  you certainly can adjust the angle  within limits  you grab the screen at the two sides  and gently tilt it  using a little force  and it tilts  i believe the whole rotation angle is about 15 degrees  the greatest contrast  and the darkest blacks  are obtained with the line of sight perpendicular to the plane of the screen
