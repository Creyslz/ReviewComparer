found something gross inside the cup   
after researching so many silicone muffin pans  i ended up purchasing this thinking it s one of the best ones out there  wrong  first  when the package arrived  the plastic wrapper was torn from the side and it was covering half of the item  i thought maybe it was rough shipping  then i saw a thick black hair  about 1   inside one of the cups  i tried to remove it  but it seemed to be stuck  after taking a closer look  i saw that about 1 4  of the hair is inside the silicone itself  gross     needless to say  returning it  on top of that  i did the pinch test and it didn t pass  silicone turned white  take a look at the pictures  at your own risk 
junk
don t waist your money on these pos protectors  they are almost impossible to line up and attract any lint or dust in the air  i decided to give these a try because of the low price  you get what you pay for  get the armor shields that provide you with a spray  this type is very easy to install and they don t attract dust particles 
turned white after use   fillers
after using  the silicone turned white in various spots indicating it has fillers  those fillers leech toxins into the baked goods when heated  i contacted the company  but no response 
not even close to being a  golf umbrella       
not even close to being a  golf umbrella    it s extremely tiny  it s enough to cover your head and if there is a little bit of wind you will get drenched 
scam
this product does not fit the s7  the install video says that it is intentionally designed so that a case won t peel up the protector but it is just a scam to get people s money  also  they changed the name of the product and raised the price  it s not gorilla glass  despicable manufacturer
