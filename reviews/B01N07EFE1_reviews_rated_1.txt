don t waste your money     
i couldn t be more disappointed if i tried  i set this thing up and it took maybe 10 minutes for it to fall apart  screwed in the screws in each section and i didn t even tighten them as hard as they should have because the particle wood started coming apart immediately  the anchor points you get are three  had a total amount of maybe 4lbs and the whole thing came crashing down  luckily it was lego figures that were hanging so putting it back together is not a big deal  it s now sitting in the same corner i put it up because if i pick it up right now  i will fling it across the room and damage something else  don t waste your money  make your own with real wood from homedepot or get it from someone that uses real wood 
super cute  but disappointing 
super cute and different than your typical shelf  great way to make use of the dreaded corner space  i didn t give it a five because it seems a little flimsy  but it may be that i wasn t able to screw the screws tight enough  we ll see what happens once i attach it to the wall tonight   update 4 22 18  finally hung the shelf and was disappointed to find that the holes were not all in the right places  as nany times as i tried  i could not get all of the shelves attached because the hotes for the screws weren t in the right places  be prepared for this if you buy it 
missing hardware   cant use
missing what hardware is needed to assemble the shelves    cannot use due to this   very disappointed 
do not buy
this was so incredibly disappointing  the wood is cheap  when i went in to screw it together the screw just spun around  the wood wasn t dense enough to hold the screw in place  it crack and fell apart  when i would get one section done and hold it up the piece would slip right off the wood
get what you pay for 
posting pictures to show the low cheap quality  there are scrarches and nicks all over the particle board  and some of the predrilled screw holes don t align  i m more upset about the scratches on the visible sides  i just pulled this out of the box  guess this will be in the kids play room not my living room  
warning 
it nice to look at  but the package didn t arrive with the proper amount of screws listed in the instructions  so i had to trek over to a hardware store to get the proper kind  also  one of the holes that was drilled to install the piece into the wall was double drilled and so the piece was loose  had to fill it with suguru to tighten it up
