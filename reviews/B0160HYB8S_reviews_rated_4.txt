great umbrella   but mine broke only after a few months
i recently traveled to ireland   scotland with my mom for a long trip  these umbrellas were incredible for our trip  they worked great and were easily to store quickly   without too much of a mess  we didn t have any issues when we were traveling  the teflon coating is great  the only reason i am marking it down a star is because mine broke only a few months after purchasing it  i was walking around outside on a rainy day and this umbrella would not close again  it was stuck in the open position  i tried fixing it for over 2 hours without any luck  unfortunately i was flying back home the next day so i had to throw the umbrella away  it was a big disappointment because i really enjoyed the umbrella up to that point  i will probably purchase again next time i need an umbrella for traveling  but for now i can steal my mom s without any issues   
umbrella has lots of good features
3rd party seller very involved  customer service communicated with me right away to make sure order and delivery went well and offered discount for next purchase  umbrella has a lot of good features  appears very sturdy with prongs very reinforced with easy arrow triggers to put umbrella up and retract  however  to get it back to original full down position  pulling it toward the handle   i needed two hands to get it down  due to the strong nature of perhaps those prongs  it is a bit heavy in weight than other umbrellas this size  the sure grip handle is nice  especially when wet  hoping not to leave this one anywhere  why i bought the compact size to throw in my purse and not on floor  
decent  a bit pricey 
this umbrella is pretty good  never had a umbrella with fiberglass before so it felt like plastic to me  if thats how fiberglass is suppose to feel like then cool   i cant say how good this works with high winds cause i haven t had any  but so far it feels sturdy  the only thing i do not like is the opening and closing mechanism  mine does not open 100  after pressing the button 100  of the time  the times it doesn t it opens more like 90 95   and it is a bit expensive at 22 a pop
great product  good pricing
purchased for a trip to shanghai during a rainy season  needed to be windproof  rainproof  large enough to shield two and fit into a suitcase  this umbrella filled all the requirements and more  i noted that the 9 struts on the umbrella gave it extra support  when the lid did flip upward in a heavy wind  it was easy to rotate the umbrella and turn the top down in stages  the automatic open close feature was nice  however in closing it was difficult to shorten the stem in order to load the spring and return the umbrella to the short length that you see in the photo  a weaker person would have difficulty or might eventually damage this umbrella 
has potential   top piece unreliable
  update  i m updating my review from 2 to 4 stars as the company was insanely fast with reaching out to me and getting me a replacement umbrella  i ve used the new one twice and so far so good   as i mentioned before  the construction is sturdy but only time will tell if it stays that way  however  would recommend buying this umbrella based on their customer service alone  the one time i got to use the umbrella i could tell that the canopy and spokes were pretty sturdy  however  as a couple of other reviews have mentioned  the top piece is either very loose or not constructed well  the second time i went to grab it  i noticed the top piece had disappeared and was nowhere to be found  this causes rain to get into the umbrella   which sort of defeats the whole purpose of having an umbrella  i ve owned at least 15 different umbrellas in my life and not one  yes  not even the  5 umbrellas you get from the guys selling on the street when it s raining  has lost the top piece  in fact  i didn t even know it was a removable piece until i found it missing on this one  if the top piece was constructed better  this umbrella would be worth a much higher rating 
sturdy looking umbrella  speedy open
looks sturdy and open close is swift and strong  good spring   make sure you don t point it at anyone when opening  it can pack a punch  had it a week  seems sturdy and will update if it flips during a gust  lost one star because when i first opened it  two of the ribs appeared stuck to each other  after debating for a bit if that was a wind management feature or not  looked more closely and seemed like when it was last closed in factory  the two rib joints may have come too close and one of the metal strands looped on another and had to be separated  so hoping it does not happen again because the speed with which the umbrella shoots open may cause the fabric to rip if stressed by ribs being stuck 
support
i am a 67 year old banker  been banking for over 45 years  i have owned lots of umbrellas over those years  this is the worst umbrella i have ever used  i got it as a christmas present and used it for the first  and only  time today  it broke on the first use  it is too late to be returned so i will throw it in the trash where it belongs update the seller has agreed to refund the purchase price in the interest of customer support  that action is one of product confidence  unfortunately mine didn t work but many other reviewers were happy 
great all purpose umbrella
larger canopy than most  weighs more than most other travel umbrellas  but is also higher quality and sturdier construction  so i am thinking one cancels out the other  and i will accept the increase in weight for an umbrella that actually does what it claims to  it really is a one handed push button open and close  it does shed rain and is completely dry in seconds  i can t tell how it does in a strong wind since i have had no opportunity to test it under windy conditions  therefore the 4 stars  by the way  i am a little old lady  so don t take the weight issue too seriously if you are not 
overpriced compared to asia but good compared to usa
one of the best umbrellas i have used compared to other ones i have bought in the usa  i have bought other umbrellas ranging from  10  20 price point from stores like walmart  walgreens  target  i notice how terrible some of the umbrellas are in the usa  but yes this one does out perform the other ones  and it seems to be lasting a lot longer  i think i can buy better umbrellas in taiwan or hong kong for a much much cheaper price  and better quality as the ones here in the usa  i hate that usa marks everything up 
broke after two uses  but customer service reacted very generously
two spokes broke after just two normal uses  so now the umbrella is a little floppy on one side and doesn t close perfectly  totally unacceptable for a product that has barely been used  eta  customer service reached out to me and offered a refund or a replacement  i chose a replacement  which the representative shipped promptly  but i was pleasantly surprised to learn that they also refunded my order  this was really generous of them  and i was happy to update my review rating to reflect the service and care that their team showed 
it definitely blocks rain but doesn t feel super strong
i bought two of these umbrellas because they were recommended by amazon and i wanted a cheap and small option for when i had to walk to work in the rain  the umbrella does the job  it blocks the rain in a small circle directly below the umbrella  i haven t had any issues yet  it does feel a little weak but i ve never had any issues with wind or anything  i m just very careful when i open and close it to make sure i don t break it  it s great for the price 
wish i could put two hands on it in hindsight  otherwise pretty great umbrella
pros  very portable  sturdy  and easy to use  keeps most of the water off me  rain rolls off and stays off well  very lightweight  button works smoothly  feels great in hand for the most part  cons  wish i could put two hands on it  the wind in my city is heavy and this thing gets hard to control sometimes  will unfortunately have to get myself a two handed umbrella but this thing will work while i m broke and in college
