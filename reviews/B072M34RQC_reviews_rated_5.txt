superb monitor
this laptop sits at just over 4 stars while some of the other similarly priced and comparable monitors from spectre  lenovo  and other brands hover around 4 5 stars  this gave me pause  but after looking through many of the 1 3 star reviews it was clear that the majority had harshly penalized the monitor due to its reportedly lackluster audio performance  my laptop has surprisingly decent sound so i could essentially care less about the monitor s speakers  now if my laptop didn t sound good then i would have simply connected my laptop to my bluetooth speaker  my old pc speakers  my blue tooth headphones  or hell even my surround sound if i felt so inclined  those reviews are overly demanding imo  first impression  time spent from opening the box to having the monitor up and running was under 5 minutes  well designed packaging and easy to put together   no screwdriver required  came with both a hdmi and an aux cord    ok cool i appreciate that but whatever  first glance of the monitor on my 38  x 24  desk and i m satisfied with its footprint  the screen bezels are tiny which looks good and helps manage size  another plus is how the base extends behind the screen as opposed to extruding in front which would take up valuable real estate in front of the monitor  the monitor and my laptop share the desk very well  and there is even generous room for an open notebook directly in front of the monitor  i m glad that i went with a 23 8  monitor over something like a 20 22  as that last 1 3 inches makes a noticeable difference in screen size  the design and style of the product is very sleek and it looks great on my desk  it definitely doesn t advertise its modest price tag with its expensive and luxury appearance  early performance  when i connected my laptop  a lightly upgraded lenovo t440p thinkpad  maybe a  400 laptop  via hdmi to the monitor i was met with a large snowy owl staring at me  one of the photos that windows cycles through before during log in   the picture was bright  edges were sharp  and the snow white feathers of the owl looked like a true pure white  the contrast between the white of the owl  its dark eyes and the brown of the tree was great and everything looked realistic and accurate  after logging in i went into the windows display settings and made a few simple adjustments on how i wanted the laptop to display to the monitor  it was very easy and intuitive to do  first thing i did was browse some hd youtube videos  a lord of the rings fight scene  and planet earth  and i was immediately impressed  the screen kept up with the intense action pace of the lotr fight without any lagging frames or stuttering  planet earth s tropical videos looked bright and accurately colorful while the following cave video was properly dark and intense with moments of brightness  here the speed of some of the small critters gave the monitor a little bit of blurring  especially when the color of the animal was similar to the color of the background  i then switched over to netflix  browsed a bit  and decided on planet earth again since the show has so many amazing spectacles to view  everything looked just as great and in some cases even a little bit better  the speed of the animals didn t seem to blur as with youtube  note  i didn t watch the exact same video so this is highly anecdotal   when it came to reading text and more general browsing of the web i was pleased  letters had sharp corners  and the additional amount of text that fits on the screen vs my 14  laptop made for less scrolling  happy with the video playback i rotated the monitor  set monitor to top height  grasp edges of screen  and twist it to the right  to portrait  the rotation felt smooth and solid  boy does it make for a long screen  but i m confident i will use it when working with long lists of data  programming  using excel  etc  i am glad i will have the option  weaknesses  as mentioned before the sound is definitely weak  the volume is low  audio sounds pretty  shallow   and there just isn t much to report there  in my mostly quiet apartment i could hear and understand the audio from the monitor  but it admittedly wasn t long before i reverted back to my laptop sound  nonetheless having an at least usable audio option as a back up is better than nothing  i will generally award more points to any item that exceeds the expectations of its main function than i will penalize a product for including an average to below average  extra  that is not vital to performance  if my computer chair gave me a back massage i would be very pleasantly surprised  but if it had a lumpy seat  didn t spin smoothly  and was stuck at a certain height i wouldn t be so pleased  i ll choose the chair that i can be comfortable in for hours  spins effortlessly and noiselessly  and adjusts height easily  i can t speak to using the monitor for gaming and whether it can handle that demand as i don t have the gaming tech knowledge  the gaming experience  or even a game to test it with  final pros  sleek aesthetic design  stand rotates landscape to portrait  tiny bezels  good brightness  dark blacks  efficient footprint  simple and smooth tilt height adjustments final cons  weak speakers  minor blurring at times of very fast moving video  i highly recommend it 
i am very happy with this purchase
i am very happy with this purchase  i wanted a monitor with the speakers built in and this has that  it is large with a clear picture  to contradict brady with the complaint about the lack of bright white on the screen  the lack of bright white is actually better for the eyes  my old monitor had a brighter white than this one  blue light damages the eyes and will keep you up at night as well  it is really a matter of adjustment  you get used to what you use  blue light is bad for the eyes and there is concern that over time with so much tv computer use and the led lighting that there will be more cases of macular degeneration  blue light also makes it hard to fall asleep  it is a quick adjustment period 
perfect 10 10 would recommend
this monitor is exactly what i was searching for  and exceeded my expectations  to be fair  i was upgrading from a dinky little 18 inch monitor with not a lot of preference options  but nonetheless this one is amazing  the slim edges are perfect to grab another and have a near seamless dual display  the height tilt adjustment is easy as pie  and i look forward to being able to work at my desk while standing  without the help of expensive desk platforms   i m also impressed by the quality of the screen and the 6 different viewing modes  which includes custom adjustments  i use my screen for gaming  movie watching  and photo editing graphic design  and i d say that it is well designed for all of them  when i say 10 10 would recommend  it s not for the sake of using a meme or being ironic  i truly mean it 
yep love it 
love love love this monitor  i am a photographer and when just in my editing program i do not have to zoom in to see the pores in the skin on a head shot  if you have a problem with it flipping don t waste your time calling hp for help they have no idea how to fix it you just have to turn it manually in your display menu  the difference from my gaming laptop to this monitor
good product but lousy instructions  hdmi cable included
although amazon suggests that you purchase an hdmi cable  a good one came with the monitor  the monitor has been up and running for a while with no problems  once i downloaded and installed drivers from hp website  the monitor has performed as advertised  it is really bright and sharp at even extreme angles  con  the instructions are lousy and unless you are knowledgeable of computers  you will have to go to the hp website for instructions which are barely adequate  this may be a problem if you have no functioning monitor because this monitor is unreadable until drivers are installed  when bought  this was a new product so maybe with time the info glut will disappear  bottom line  this is a good product 
awesome quality  large  lower price
i wanted to buy this same monitor from my local walmart however they constantly only had 1 or 2 but i couldn t ever get there in time to catch two that i needed  i found the same monitor on here for cheaper  the mount that comes with it is very interesting  it also adds the advantage of going straight up or down  however i used two of these mounted on a desk stand for a side by side configuration  i love having the thin borders as you can put these side by side and it almost looks like one seamless screen  the quality of these monitors is amazing as i play a flight simulator with high graphics  i also do some photo and video editing so the 24  provides plenty of area to see every single detail  i love these things  it was well worth the money
beautiful monitor  well rounded for the price   
monitor is beautiful  easy to setup  and self installed on my machine  stand is steady but small enough to not eat much desk space up  hdmi ports give easy access to cross as a tv  which is does seamlessly  used for gaming looks great as long as you aren t coming off of a 4k   and it has more than enough juice for any office computer  though it may make you want to upgrade your video card  well packaged as well  and easy to navigate menu instructions for customizing your color setup   very happy with my purchase about 3 months in 
great value with full hd  ips panel  and full ergo adjustments
was on the look out for larger monitor for my home office and for casual browsing and editing pictures  and did not want to pay more than  150  my requirements were full hd  24 27 inch   ips panel for better viewing angles  instead of tn panel  and full height tilt adjustments so my wife could adjust and easily use instead of having to adjust heights with books  i got the is for 109  normal price is 129   at this price point this is such a great value and checked all the boxes for me  screen quality was perfect for my needs and color reproduction was very decent  build quality is very good and the stand feels sturdy and easy to adjust  getting height adjustments and full hd ips panel at this price point feels like an excellent buy  speakers are pretty tinny but that was not a consideration for me   make sure you increase the speaker volume to 100  through the monitor menu first and then control with computer volume control after that   very happy with this purchase  highly recommend at this price 
my favorite monitor ever 
i am really picky with monitors and this totally fit the bill  i love the square base and the ability to change the height of the monitors as well as the rotation feature  having the speakers in the monitor is a space saver  i don t have a large desk so i save space where i can  the image is super clear and the large screen is very nice  everything functions exactly as described  shipping was very quick and the monitors  i purchased 2  where packaged very securely for shipping 
very nice monitor  color a bit dull and lacks depth
bought this from amazon two weeks ago  the hp vh240a is very good considering the price point  screensize  and height adjustment feature with speakers  however  at only 72  srgb  it lacks color richness and depth  we bought at the same time a dell s2418hx which is also 24  but has 99  srgb with more vivid color  deeper depth  on screen control  to adjust the colors etc   and much better speakers for about  40 00 more  the hp vh240a sold for only  109 99 sometimes  highly recommend it if you don t care too much about the quality of the small built in speakers and the somewhat dull colors  it was very well packaged and protected  amazon mailed without extra protection 
good monitor for my new macbook pro 
this is a cadillac  i previously bought an lg to go with my macbook pro  and it didn t work  and was poorly made  after i returned it to best buy  i purchased this hp  and the construction is better  and the price was acceptable  it works fine with the macbook pro  and i have it set up to mirror my desk top  i did not even have to download new drivers for it  it is also the correct height  so i didn t have to buy an additional monitor stand  so saved another  25 
ergonomic and flexible display with great image quality
great display  the fact that it is height adjustable is critical  contrary to how many people position their display  it should be positioned so that you look slightly down at it  not straight at it  most displays are too high for me on their standard foot  the build quality is pretty good  the image quality is better than expected  the colors look natural  the backlight is very even and the contrast seems decent  at this price it s simply a steal 
the monitor stand is really nice  rotates easily and feels sturdy
clear picture after i did some adjustments in the menus  the monitor stand is really nice  rotates easily and feels sturdy  affordable and very clean looking  hope it lasts  would buy again  update  did find one dead pixel  super bummed out but there s my only complaint 
it works great   i was able to set it up    
i ordered this as a bigger screen for my macbook air  i got this screen  along with a keyboard and mouse combo for  15  logitech  and a mini display port to hdmi cable  it works great   i was able to set it up all by myself  which is saying something b c i am not tech person  now it feels like i have a brand new desktop computer by simply plugging my macbook into the monitor and keyboard  the monitor itself is great  nice size  big enough to open two documents at once or edit a larger 11x17 doc  the resolution looks top notch to me  though  again  i m not a tech person  i am very happy with the purchase and price  i would highly recommend 
a great budget swivel monitor
i guess i m weird  i like having one monitor in my dual monitor setup as a swivel monitor  i do a lot of word processing and portrait oriented graphic design  so to me it makes sense to have a monitor that can accommodate portrait orientation  this monitor is a very affordable  sensible solution  the resolution is sufficiently sharp to do most tasks without wanting to drag it to another monitor  the image is full bleed which wasn t the case with my last hp hdmi monitor  to be fair  though  that monitor was eight years old when it quit   the bezel is very slim and almost disappears when you re using the monitor 
super crisp images
crisp and clear  some people don t like the audio and while i wouldn t listen to music from them  for an office setting where i listen to news or an occasional youtube video at lunch  they are perfect 
awesome monitor with a reasonable price  
this monitor is a deal   my general use of this one is for my office work and its features of height adjustment   tilt has really helped me in my neck and shoulder pain  the built in speakers arent so good but my use doesnt require them  so it works great  one of the best deals i found with both the height adjustment and tilt options 
great great value
great monitor i have flipped vertically to use with my other hp 23 8 inch monitor i have had for years and this one allow 200 dollars less expensive is the newer version and with the included hdmi cable it is an excellent clear picture  great value installed it and was recognized by my pc in about 2 minutes
hp 23 8 inch fhd ips monitor
hp 23 8 inch fhd ips monitor is an excellent choice and upgrade over previous hp monitors  if you re looking for a 23   monitor at  140 and below    this is it     features and functions are excellent  except for the built in speakers  don t buy this monitor if you re looking for sound  buy it for the quality of the graphics and features 
very affordable computer monitor
im very satisfied with this computer monitor  i usually dont like big screens but this 23inch monitor is just right  it has some pros and cons  pros  big screen great visual effects built in speakers you can move the monitor to face like a portrait cons  the computer monitor speakers are not all that but its good enough to watch a youtube video when you dont want to put your headset on 
hp 23 8 inch fhd ips monitor w tilt
i have been an hp lover since the early days   the monitor has been on my list for a very long time   finally i have it   talk about functionality this is it and the chips  can t praise hp for coming up with this  tilt screen   comes in very handy for reading full page docs  pics  etc 
for the price  its amazing  superb monitor
i purchased this monitor for hp pavilion power gaming desktop computer  amd ryzen 5 1400  nvidia geforce gtx 1060  16gb ram  1tb hard drive  128gb ssd  windows 10  580 148  black    so far i have had no problems with this monitor and it works great  i wanted a monitor with the speakers built in and this has that  the screen is large and clear  the bezel around the top and sides is ultra thin and looks awesome  solid stand  height adjustment  and rotation  the speaker could be better  but it gets the job done 
fantastic monitor for the price
fantastic monitor for the price  the only problem is my desk is small and this fills it up  but that s not the monitor s fault  i love being able to have two full documents open to work on  one for research and one for writing for instance   raises and lowers like a dream 
you want this monitor
this monitor is fantastic  used as a 2nd monitor to an mac with a mini hdmi cord  the screen height is adjustable and tilts  color and contrast is great  this makes me very happy  i am thinking about getting one more for a double monitor set up in my home office 
perfect  
bought it during black friday 2017 for  110   it came in on time  nicely packed and perfect for my gaming setup  installation is easy  they had the guide  but it was easy enough that i didnt need it  the monitor stand makes my setup looks neat  the monitor frame is so thin   hence the reason i bought it  i know this monitor was meant for professional coders or whatever but it was amazing for gaming as well 
this is a keeped
i had a monitor this size  and thought it was broken  so i searched  and found this one  at a good price  when a friend helped me hook it up  it turns out the old one just had a problem with a wire  then worked fine  though i would rather be frugal  i am not sending this one back  love that i can adjust the height    i purchased a separate hdmi cable  this comes with one  don t buy one 
easy to hook up  even for a novice  has picture instructions 
received this hp monitor today  i have no experience with hooking up these things as i m in my 70s  and i couldn t believe how easy it was  a big sheet of pictures on how to plug everything in was included  the display is absolutely wonderful  you need to have your computer with the internet on  and it automatically downloads whatever you need to start by just pressing the ok  i m so happy i chose this monitor 
great monitor
it s perfect for me   not only does it got from straight up to tilted  i use it straight up   but it rises and lowers   so i can adjust the height  my only quibble is that the sound is very low  for me  
nice monitor   
nice monitor  i have it portrait orientation  it s quite tall    it screwed on to my humanscale monitor arm no problem  very little edge frame  lightweight  using with linux mint kde sonya 64 bit 
really sleek looking monitor
i buy a lot of 24 monitors for my employees  and this is hands down the best looking monitor ive purchased  the bezel around the top and sides is ultra thin and looks awesome  the stand is very nice due to its ability not only to tilt the screen and rotate the screen 90 degrees  portrait mode  but also to raise it  ill be buying more of these 
this monitor is amazing and a great deal for the price
this monitor is amazing and a great deal for the price  it is large enough  bright enough and overall it s just great  the vga and hdmi connections work very well for me when i need to use it with different computers  i highly recommend this monitor for anyone needing a larger screen that you are able to tilt and adjust as needed  i can only speak to the quality of this monitor from the perspective of using it for office related activities  i don t use it for gaming however  it also displays well for watching videos  i e  youtube  netflix  etc    i think for the price  the quality is quite excellent 
great monitor for this price point 
very happy with this monitor  i purchased two for the kids gaming rigs  i like the thin frame and design  it has an external power supply 
super slim bezels  great for multi monitor setups
great bang for the buck  has internal speakers  not great  but do work    color and clarity are above average  very pleased  i actually bought 3  ips color reproduction is superb  faster than oled 
great monitor  the adjustable height is a great feature    
great monitor  the adjustable height is a great feature for those who want their monitor at a correct height  the edge of the screen is also very small which makes it very easy to look at rather than having 1 1 25 inches of edge  also looks pretty cool 
excellent value
the image quality is fantastic  especially considering the price  the anti glare matte finish works really well and i can comfortably use this monitor next to a window  there is one small issue though  the monitor has washed out colors out of the box  i had to increase the vibrancy using the nvidia control panel  if you are running off intel hd graphics  you will not be able to adjust the color settings if you use the hdmi cable 
five stars
is perfect for use that i intended  wish that volume was higher when using hdmi interface 
fantastic
its a great monitor  it is massive and a vast improvement over my old one  also a lot brighter  i like the height adjustment and the fixed screen  my old one was always a little crooked  pointing a little far to the left or right and pointing a little far down or up  the height couldn t be adjusted either  i ve used it for a few weeks and have had no problems  i broke the screen but amazon was nice enough to ship a replacement for free  i was expecting it to be a little tougher but i think it was mostly my fault in the end 
perfect 
i bought this for my in laws who have had trouble in the past reading and viewing things on their previous monitor  this one is excellent for the price  they really like that it includes speakers  and i did too  because that s less cabling involved for them  this is an excellent monitor  and i highly recommend it 
i m very pleased with my monitor
i m very pleased with my monitor  i can raise it lower it to whatever height i need   the color is so clear an perfect   it was late getting here but we had a winter storm with several inches of ice an snow but didn t expect it to be on time   i m very happy with monitor an delivery of it   
great monitor 
great monitor  the screen is bright and vibrant  i love the adjustability as this was the main reason i chose this monitor  it is a lot of monitor for the price  delivery was prompt 
clear  bright  wide enough to split screen with full size documents
this is a great monitor  the picture is clear and bright  and i particularly like the thin bezel  the screen is exactly wide enough to put two documents at full size side by side on the screen  which is invaluable in my work  no need for multiple monitors 
great image  thin bezel  come with built in speakers
1  come with built in speakers  but sound quality is worse than macbook pro s 2  can switch to portrait mode and move vertically to adjust height 3  decent image quality as an ips fhd monitor 4  thin bezel design great monitor for the price  if you are not looking for a 4k monitor  then this is a very good choice 
well made  great price 
awesome price for everything you get  slim bezel  raise up and down  tilt back and forth  hdmi connection  stand or wall mountable  built in speakers  good display   i was very impressed by the quality when i opened up the box  product is sturdy and well made 
this was a great deal for me
this was a great deal for me  i work from home and i needed 2 monitor for a reasonable price  shipping was quick  very well packed  just snap to to gather  not as clear as my other monitor  the important part of this monitor is that it works for what i needed it for 
amazing picture  frameless sides  slim and lightweight 
have 2 of these  been using them for about a week now and i couldnt be happier  theyre great  integrated speakers and amazing colorful display  slim and frameless display makes them easy to put the together as one screen or keep them separate if you want that too 
bang for the buck 
speakers are weak  as i correctly assumed  screen is thin and image video is crisp  at this price  why even get the no name brands 
i like the tilt height adjustment and that the side edge is    
i purchased two to add multiple monitors to my laptop running windows10 using a dual hdmi adapter  i like the tilt height adjustment and that the side edge is small  they are a good fit on my desk which is just 48 inches  i use them long hours for business and don t have the problems with glare that i have with laptop screens  they were well packaged and arrived promptly in perfect condition 
perfect 
this is absolutly amazing and just what i needed  the ability to rotate the screen 90 is something i ve looked for for awhile but never found anything in my price range  until now  though  it arrived upside down because thr entire bottom of the box ripped
great monitor
i ordered this for one of my employees  was just looking for a decent sized monitor at a reasonable price  got more than i expected with this one  as i hadn t noticed that it rotates which is a game changer when viewing long spreadsheets  think i may order a couple for my own workstation 
i d get another one in a second
it s all that i wanted  great product  color  sharpness  it tilts  which i needed  completely satisfied and a very fair price 
very fine monitor
this monitor works very well  it has an excellent  non glare screen with excellent resolution  along with a matte black finish on the rest of the monitor  the stand is sturdy  the tilt function is useful and is easy to manipulate 
nice
very nice computer screen  i love the tilt i just wished it tilted both to the left and right 
great extension for laptop
yes  to many others  point  the audio is terrible  however  i love this monitor as an extension for my macbook  i use it for writing research papers and doing statistical analysis  which do not require great graphics  but need a lot of desktop room 
great monitor for the price 
love it  it doesn t come with a vga cable  which i needed  only hdmi   i don t think i factored that in  has a nice  clear picture  good size w  adjustable height   built in speakers   overall a pretty great monitor for the price  i m very pleased 
this is probably your best shot  i got this monitor to game on    
for the gamers out there  if you are looking for a monitor that has decent built in speakers for your console  ps4  xbox   this is probably your best shot  i got this monitor to game on my ps4 and its exactly what i was looking for  a monitor with speakers which also has an audio jack so i could plug in my portable speakers to them if i wanted to  it also works great with a laptop as i use it for work and game  i wouldn t buy this monitor if i wanted to listen to music with it  but its sufficient for sound effects and soundtracks playing from your games 
love this monitor
love this monitor  easy to set up  size is good for my desk  i had read the comments about others having audio problems  mine was also so low it could hardly be heard  finally  found a menu button on the bottom right side of the monitor  chose audio  increased to 100   it was set at 60    had full sound  would recommend 
nice  easy to setup and connect
nice  easy to setup and connect  like the minimal bezel around the screen  which allows my dual monitor setup to practically have the picture right next to each other  hardly any break in continuity 
excellent monitor
excellent monitor  speakers are okay  good enough unless your a music nut  okay for casual listening certainly not hi fi  screen color rendition is excellent  i run it at about 80  brightness and very pleasing  well worth the money 
i really like the screen design overall and have a 25xw hp    
i really like the screen design overall and have a 25xw hp monitor to act as its pair  the color difference between them by default isn t that different don t by these for their speakers  i don t think you should ever buy monitors for their speakers  get a nice set of monitor speakers if you can  overall i really like this monitor as 1080p works well for my average viewing distance of 3 5ft 
this monitor has a good mix of features and performance for the money
this monitor has a good mix of features and performance for the money  you would be hard pressed to find a monitor with up down stand adjustments and internal speakers with a good quality display for the money  display quality is good  not spectacular  sound of internal speakers are decent  overall i would say the price point for the features makes a very good buy 
five stars
awesome monitors  i bought 2 and great for gaming 
nice monitor
large monitor with easy assembly and clear visuals  would purchase again 
oh yeah 
fantastic monitor for the money  super thin frame  high resolution  this is a must buy
