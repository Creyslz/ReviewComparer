if you get a defective pair  don t expect any customer service help and say goodbye to your money
i purchased a pair of these earphones in december 2017 due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews  when they first arrived i was so happy with the sound quality  comfort level in ear  and their ability to block outside noise  i use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer  i am by no means rough with them  i store them carefully  i d had my last pair for 8 years  etc  however  only one month after purchase  the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working  i attempted to return them through amazon and was instead told to contact panasonic directly  i tried numerous times to use the panasonic website s live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time  no matter what time of day i tried   i then called their 1 888 support number and the first thing the automated message warned me was that i risked being charged a  9 99 service fee for help if i continued with the phone call and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty  given that i didn t know if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty  i opted to just hang up at that point  write off my money spent  and order a second pair  they arrived on january 25  2018  and again  i was satisfied  less than two weeks later  while watching a homework video  the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working  i called panasonic again figuring that this time it had to be covered under some warranty at less than 2 weeks old  the customer service rep sent me the e mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs and i later received an e mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones  they stated that i was only allowed to ship the product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container  that it needed to be certain size of that container  and that i would need to pay for tracking and insurance on the product on top of the shipping  the total amount for shipping cost more than three pairs of these headphones and they wouldn t guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to replace the two broken ones  this is the worst experience i ve ever had with a purchase from amazon  i was disappointed and frustrated that i could not conduct my return directly through amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the case on amazon  but instead had to do the whole runaround with panasonic  and i still don t know whether panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs  based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like i did just get unlucky  twice  with defective pairs  however  if you re one of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer service to make it right 
be careful before you deiced to buy their products  one product has different qualities
they have two different qualities from the same product  i bought one at the beginning that i was totally satisfied with the quality  around a month later  i ordered another one for my brother  it turned out the new one has a really cheap quality and it doesn t work and have so many issues my brother noticed that even the call answering button was on the left cord  usually it is on the right cord  so i checked the panasonic ergofit in ear earbuds headphones with mic controller rp tcm125 w  white  packaging and it turned out the packaging was different from the first one i got  even the quality of the packaging was a cheap quality packaging  also  same products have different barcode numbers and different model numbers  the cheap quality has an instruction paper that was in the packaging and most of it was written in chinese  i m totally disappointed since i felt that was clearly deception  i ordered a replacement for the one i got and i got another one with the same good quality  that s where i believe that they are cheating on customers 
sound goes in and out 2nd pair broke
i got these yesterday  theres a strip in the wire because the sound goes in and out when i touch it  very disappointed  ill edit this review if i can get a new set  i dont feel like dealing with customer support over the phone  i just want what i paid for  and since i bought the purple pair  i expect to get  16 worth  edit  i bought another pair and they broke instantly  i ended up throwing away two pairs of these things  nothing but junk 
seriously awful  please make sure you read the return policy 
these headphones are awful  i arrived them broken yesterday with one headphone not playing sound  because of the return policy  i can not return them  the headphone that does work sounds like it s underwater 
product arrived defective  no return allowed
i ve purchased these headphones three times  always have solid sound quality and fit comfortably in my ears  however  was very disappointed this product arrived damaged in the packaging  plastic wire covering defective  leaving part of the wires exposed   would have just filed a return but received an error saying this product cannot be returned  super frustrating that i m now stuck with a defective product and no way to get my money back        update  i checked further and sent a  get product support  message to see if there s an alternative way to get the product returned  filled out a quick message  the next page simply includes the manufacturing contact info  1 800 support number  and a link to panasonic s own website  amazon s own link for  more assistance  at the bottom of the page is broken and just shows some code for a relative link  totally unusable  just know if you get a defective item you re stuck 
didn t work as they should 
was given these as a present   wife bought them based on the overall good reviews  but they didnt work at all for me  now  to be fair  in ear is not my favorite style of headphones  but that wasn t the issue  they were actually fairly comfortable  the issue is the sound isn t consistent and was terrible  when i could get it to be consistently stay plugged in properly  sound was fairly good  my suspicion is the plug isn t built properly   any slight movement of the wire  my phone  etc  would cause the sound to be bad   only in one ear  volume would go down  remote wouldn t work  etc  would go in an out  especially if i put my phone in my pocket and was walking  which i often do  i m pretty sure the plug wasn t staying in the headphone jack properly   maybe it was too small  i thought maybe my phone case was doing something  i e  too thick and was  pulling  the cord out   but tried without the case and had the same issue  on another note  couldn t figure out how to use the remote on the wire to change the volume   maybe i was missing how to use it for that  but i m usually pretty good with this stuff  so pretty sure there wasn t a way to change the volume with it   if this was the case  it is a bad design  i really wanted to like these headphones  but at least the pair i have just don t work like they should  i m going to try to replace these  as i m hoping that perhaps i just got a defective pair  hopeful that a new pair will be better  but not entirely convinced    if a new pair works better  i plan to update this review 
lasted less than 24 hours
had these for exactly one day  suddenly  i could not hear the vocals on my songs  everything else seemed fine  wiggled the wire a bit  and the vocals came back  combined with the fact that the ear bud sizes are too big  i m not impressed  the smallest ear buds for this is equivalent to my old pair s medium  considering today s trends  i may be giving up on wired headphones and going for bluetooth  i can t seem to find decent quality control anywhere  which is ridiculous 
only good if you use them while staying perfectly still 
the sound is fine  too many other problems with these though  they tangle like crazy  the ear pieces don t stay in ear well and keep falling out while i m running  they give you a few different sizes  but they are nearly impossible to change out  i have an iphone 6 with a very slim case  and the port to this won t stay securely in my phone and slips out  i guess these would be ok if you put them in and sat perfectly still  but they don t work for me  looking for something else 
serious cons
i liked them for about an hour    before i knew what i was getting into  for starters forget trying to return these  amazon wont let you  ive been trying to use these for almost a month  i use headphones daily    the sound quality is terrible  the chord is so thin its breaking  these are extremely uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes  i dont know why    cheap obviously  i have sores on the insides of my ears  they make my ears itch  then develop the sores    as a side note  they are made with a material that could cause cancer  hence ive stopped using them and never will again    all the past good reviews are no more  they must have changed their product i guess    zero noise cancellation  and sound quality is bad and spotting  just dont buy them    just dont  save yourself the hassle    buy something from a store that accepts returns  good luck
beware as these are not able to be returned through amazon if defective 
when i first opened these they fit very comfortable in my ears  when i tried listening to them the sound in the right ear kept shorting out  went to amazon to try to return them and learned i could not return them even though i had just purchased them a few days ago  instead i was given the phone number to panasonic customer support  i was disconnected twice from customer support while they tried to transfer me to the right person  i realize these headphones were only  8 but its the principle of it that they make you jump through all of these hoops from the manufacturer to return a defective product  normally amazon returns items quickly with little effort  given all of the positive reviews of these headphones i am assuming i just got a defective pair  update  i called panasonic to start a return  they told me i would have to ship the  8 earbuds to them first then they would fix them and send them back to me  very disappointed as it would cost me at least that much to ship them in the first place  not a fan of panasonic right now and surely will never buy any panasonic headphones again 
expensive garbage price of product and quality dont match up 
the headphones pretty much suck  dont let the brand name or the packageing marketing fool you  stopped fucntioning in less than two weeks  sound is ok but not great  just more garbage  the pack if two i bought  9 worked just as good  lasted just as long  only didnt sound quite as good but neither are great  do not buy
panasonic   just one more example of too big to fail
no good   one side broke within 1st week of use  panasonic pulled this product off the market       and per chat with a panasonic agent this morning       they have totally discontinued making these headphones  but   you are welcome to return it to them at a warranty handling cost that is equal to the cost of buying a new one       oh yes       we get to pay them twice for replacing their defective headphones  good bye forever panasonic  just one more example of too big to fail  wishing you as much continued success as you deserve for your non handling of an obviously defective product 
my son bought these based on the great reviews  when we received them
my son bought these based on the great reviews  when we received them  only one of the earbuds produced sound  and the other one literally fell apart  very disappointed in quality  then when we tried to return the item  we were automatically directed to panasonic support which is only open during regular business hours  we were not given the option to return to amazon even though the item was sold by amazon  i am honestly shocked that this doesn t seem to be a returnable item  i always used to rave about amazon s service and standing behind the products they sell  i told my son to consider it an  8 lesson in getting what you pay for  but we expected much better based on other reviews 
not good    not good at all 
the packaging for these headphones was literally one of the hardest things i ve had to open so that was slightly annoying  what was really annoying is that the headphones came with bad wiring so any slight movement caused the sound to cut out  or the sound to become distorted  they aren t usable  also  the package came with the rubber ear bud replacements    i only received 1 small sized ear bud replacement  not a set   and the small ear buds are the size i use  not good
