perfect display  no
is this a stunning  perfect display  no  not really  but it is perfect as a low cost secondary display for a laptop  i work from home frequently  and my little laptop screen wasn t cutting it to connect to the bigger dual monitor display setup i have on my desk at work  i needed something that was fairly inexpensive  but would be easy on the eyes when i m coding for work  i bought it along with a vesa adapter and a mounting arm  because i like to put my secondary displays in portrait mode  and the stand it comes with doesn t do that  color and resolution seem pretty good  the back light is nice  there s a tiny bit of light bleed around the edge of mine  but i use it in a fully lit room during daytime hours  so it s not bothersome  i do wish that the place you put the vesa adapter or stand was more centered  because the monitor is a little wobbly  even on the arm i have it mounted on  otherwise  it s a solid monitor considering i only paid  100 for it  if you re looking for some fancy display for watching high definition movies and playing games  maybe this isn t it  but if you need a second or third monitor for internet browsing   writing code   basic stuff  this is a good choice 
hesitant at first  found out great for gaming 
great monitor  i was little hesitant at first because it s specs seemed a little lower than others  such as contrast ratio and response time  i m an avid gamer who needed a new monitor right before college that wouldn t burn a hole in my pocket  very happy with what i got  i also thought 21 5 was a little small for gaming  but it s pretty big in person and it ll definitely satisfy anyone who wants to watch movies or play games often  after about a months use  i ve encountered no problem  and only see quality 
good monitor for the price 
i m writing this review using this monitor  it works just fine  you have to finish constructing the monitor onto it s stand  and  the manufacturer s image that shows on amazon indicates the package includes a hdmi cable  it in fact  does not  it only includes a vga cable  the monitor is capable of supporting either  which is nice  there is a little wear on the monitor on the top corners    the screen itself  not the casing   very tiny dots that most people might not notice  the monitor itself is great for the price  it does allow you to tilt it at different angles  however  you cannot raise or lower it   i mean  you could  with the help of a book or box or something to sit it on  but  the fact you can t adjust the height hasn t caused me an issue  it also has a choice of picture settings  you can adjust the monitor picture settings to what you need for optimal viewing for any room or lighting  it defaults to a picture setting labeled  low blue light   this setting seems fine for regular computer work  i have ordered a second one of these to extend my desktop to two monitors  i did have to purchase a usb multi monitor adapter for this which is normal if your pc doesn t already have the multi monitor capability 
best bang for the buck 
considering the price that i didn t have to pay  i d say that this monitor is about perfect for the needs of most people  it s a decent size display at almost 22 inches  it s nice and slim and fits well on a small table or desk  which is great for me   and the best part is that it looks almost perfect  this is the best monitor i have ever used personally  and i am glad that i found it at such a steal  my local walmart doesn t even carry an hdmi monitor  let alone at such a low price point  my only really complaint is that i can t use the auto switching as it has created problems in which it would tell me to check the hdmi cable constantly  after turning this feature off in the settings  it hasn t given me this issue  which is fine since i only ever use it with my mac mini  the stand is also a little flimsy  allowing this display to shake slightly when bumped  however  it is so minor that it really doesn t bother me  overall  this machine is well worth it 
great monitor with an unusual design choice
great monitor with an unusual design choice  this monitor has only hdmi and vga inputs  in other words there is no dvi input  hardly any modern video card even provides vga anymore so i wonder what that is for  however there are many video cards that have dvi output but no hdmi  in order to use this monitor for vr gaming i had to buy a display port to hdmi adapter  the reason being is my video card had hdmi  dvi and display port outputs and the vr headset was using the hdmi port so i had to get a display port to hdmi to use this monitor  the picture quality is good but not excellent  my old 21 inch acer seems just as good  for the price though it is an outstanding deal but be prepared to have some video adapters in your future 
great product for the money 
bought this to replace an older monitor that finally died  i m happy with it and for the money you can t go wrong   y monitor was newer than the tower i was using it with so there was a different connector for the monitor on my machines video card  simply used the hdmi cable and it works a charm since i m using it on an hp machine i thought it would connect right up three years is a lifetime for a computer these days i suspect no matter how up to date you keep them  still i m more than satisfied with this monitor and it was very easy to set up and get running  the included software makes adjustments a breeze of course the adjustment buttons are all along the bottom of the frame as is the onoff switch 
good overall monitor for basic computer usage
keep in mind this is a  100 monitor  if you keep that price point in mind  this is a really good monitor  don t expect a crystal clear  high quality  apple like monitor  i think i ve been spoiled by the clear  beautiful glass of my imac and macbook because this monitor came off as disappointing at first until i reminded myself that it s very affordable  if you re looking to add a monitor to your setup and aren t expecting a retina display  you will be happy with this monitor  it was really easy to set up and has a relatively thin profile  i m using it as an extra screen for my macbook  and i m really happy to have all that extra desktop space now  i think the only other thing i was kind of surprised by was how low the monitor sits  it does have the mount that holds up the monitor  but it s only about 3 inches tall  compared to an imac s monitor positioning  the hp seems really short  i haven t critically viewed it for coloring  but with basic usage the coloring is fine  my final thought is i recommend the white model  it looks a lot nicer and cleaner than the black model  i got the black model and wish i had gotten white 
its cheap and looks good at 1920 x 1080
its cheap and looks good at 1920 x 1080    that said   it does not come with a hdmi cable so remember to get one   it has no speakers and it has no way to place it on a vesa stand as is  although the base sits pretty low it does tilt back and forward  if all that works out for you  then it should be fine   picture is pleasant  i use it for movies and a streaming pc next to my gaming pc   i strongly suggest a 144hz monitor for gaming with a good graphics card   i do not game with this one nor was i expecting too   did i mention its  cheap  
decent quality  but with a few minor flaws
nice  good quality display  works pretty much as well as you d expect  i do have a couple complaints though  first  despite claiming to support ddc ci  it even has an option for enabling and disabling it in the settings menu  it seems like this monitor doesn t work well with the ddc  while all my other monitors  brightness settings can be controlled using the software i m using clickmonitorddc 3 5 this monitor ignores commands from the software and doesn t seem to work with it at all  secondly  the monitor sometimes takes quite awhile to wake up from sleeping  sometimes up to 10 seconds  which slows me down quite frequently when i m trying to log into my computer 
great value   crisp picture but lacks color accuracy for pro applications
this hp 21 5 ips monitor has great picture quality and is an excellent monitor for the price  its a perfect option for the everyday consumer for web browsing  watching video and casual gaming  the color accuracy isnt quite up to the level for serious photo video editors or color grading  its decent option as a secondary additional monitor  for keeping an eye on things outside the main workflow  also  the response time is fine for the everyday gamer  but competitive gamers frame buffs are going to want a faster response time  that said  for under  100  monitor is compelling option 
hp pavilion 22cwa 21 5 inch monitor
my older hp slimline desktop has just the vga output  and i neglected to get the vga to hdmi adapter  i should receive the vga to hdmi adapter in a couple days  and i will then give an updated review once i have the adapter installed  otherwise  viewing the vga output is not bad if all you have is vga capability  i also recommend to lower the blue light display to save your eye strain     update  received the vga to hdmi adapter and installed  very easy btw  and the display is why i upgraded to hd instead of the ol  vga  very nice monitor for the price    
cheap and good   possible  yes 
one of the best screens on the market  for a cheap price that it goes for  for a person who just has a laptop  and when ever i get back home i plug in my secondary monitor to do work on  or multitask  it is definitely  bang for a buck   why  for a person who does not edit photos  or look into image cleanliness or any other editing software too heavily  i believe this is a great choice  would i recommend it  absolutely  i might be a little bit different costumer for a product like this  because it is not a main screen  i tend to look at it 40  of the time i m on my computer  but for a person who is using this as a main screen   go for it  and while you re at it  grab two  why 4 stars then  no speakers  from an hdmi screen you d expect a speaker these days  no  i was not disappointed when i got it  i read the description and knew exactly what i m getting  but it s just that one small detail that lacks the perfect score  mainly due to the fact  that my laptop comes equipped with weak and noisy speakers  in a bad way   thus making me resort to external audio sources 
looks good  works well   
so  it hooks up fine and looks good    resolution is very good for my needs  back up graphics computer     with only a couple reservations  with the price consideration intact   the vga hookup is antiquated in my opinion    my video card doesn t even have a vga output  but fortunately i had an adapter in my  old  computer apparatus box  it worked  monitor seems to be clean  bright and worth the low price  btw    i had mistakenly put the stand base wrong side up   as it seemed several other reviewers might have also    snap button goes on the bottom side    at first it would not snap together securely  upon closer inspection  i noticed my error and it now works correctly 
the monitor is a good monitor for hd viewing   max 1920 x 1080    
the monitor is a good monitor for hd viewing   max 1920 x 1080 resolution    i would not recommended it for gaming but for the price you cannot beat it if your are doing all day computing as working with microsoft word   excel  doing cad and rendering videos in hd  it met my expectations and is very easy to use  plug and play in windows 10  i am using it with graphics card quadro k620 2 gb 128 bit  if you want greater resolution this is not the monitor for you 
just one problem   
good monitor  just one problem    the power supply isn t internal so there s a power brick that comes with this unit  that wouldn t be so bad if the cord between the monitor and the brick weren t so short  it s only 36  long which makes it hard to put the brick on the floor  in which case it has to sit up on your desk 
excellent monitor
quite pleased with this monitor  it arrived quickly and was quite easy to set up and get started with  brilliant and bright screen and gives plenty of space to spread out with a number of open windows  the only criticism i d make is that it doesn t permit enough tilt to the front  with only a 2  option i found it still hard to enjoy the looks  i added about a quarter inch  buffer  under the back of the stand and that made it exactly right  just think it would be better if hp had allowed more front tilt 
resolution for my blinking monitor
this is an update to my review which had been   my monitor had been blinking and flickering using a hdmi cable and windows 7   the steps below resolved the problem   in firefox i clicked the menu button and selected options  selected the advanced panel and then the general tab   unchecked   use hardware acceleration when available    restarted firefox and the flickering stopped
office use only   amazing price
the reason you buy this monitor should be the price  if you expect to edit photos on this you will be in trouble  a black color looks black in the middle but as you move it around it can look blue in the corners for example  so you would remove some blue in that picture until you realize it looks green for everyone else  this is a bit subtle indeed  but would become a serious problem for anything related to image video editing
