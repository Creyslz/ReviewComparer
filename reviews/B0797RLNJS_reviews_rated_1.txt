i don t know why all the good reviews  this is the worst umbrella i ve ever used  i just opened it at home  and it will not easily fold back up  i do not have 10 minutes to spend trying to fold it back up every time  it does appear to be good quality other that that  it costs me the  6 85 to return it and i only paid 11  for the umbrella to begin with  i am so frustrated 
broke the first time i used it 
this umbrella literally broke the first time i tried to open it  of course it was pouring rain too  the little handle popped right off when i was trying to get it latched into the open position 
one star
no easy release button  need to push really hard to open and really hard to pull it shut 
cheaply made
this umbrella is very cheaply made  the metal bar is very thin and bends  would not buy
