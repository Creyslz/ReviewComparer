good product at good price  but qc problem
good product  easily assembled  but had a grumpifying qc failure  one of the post joiners was misthreaded  but had been driven firmly home  such that there was a six degree bend in the middle of the post when assembled  it took a soft jawed vise  a soft jawed vise grip and a breaker bar to get the joiner out  fortunately  the threads    though damaged    were not destroyed  and i was able to insert the joiner manually with the threads properly aligned   if someone without a well equipped workshop had gotten this  s he would not have been able to assemble it  once the defect was remedied  it went together easily  and seemed entirely the equal of more expensive units of like design  i found myself wishing there were a wider size range available  i like it well enough that i would buy it again  an incidental advantage is the one inch diameter of the posts  it made it easy to fashion leg extenders for the rear legs to accommodate a 3 inch step down in the floor   1  id thick walled pvc pipe  1  hardwood dowel  3 8  threaded inserts  see photo 
sturdy  good value  useless instructions
the shelves are sturdy and a good value  the assembly instructions are useless  don t waste your time  if you google wire shelving rack assembly  you will find a video showing exactly how to put these together  the video is for a different brand  but it is exactly the same  the little clips that hold the shelves in place are a little funky  they don t tell you this  but if you look inside you will see a tiny little ridge  when you put the clips on the support poles  you want to position them just above the groove where you want them  if you slide them down and you will hear a click when they hit the groove  alternatively  you can leave them just above  and when you put the shelf on you can push the shelf down and it will keep going down until the clips hit the groove  after doing more several  i found the first way gave me better results  the first shelving unit took a long time to assemble  mostly because i was trying to read the useless instruction book  after watching the video  the next one took 20 minutes 
so pretty    
it s so affordable for me to use this at my college  however  the two parts that connects and is suppose to stay moved very easily while i was placing the shelves  it made the process just quite harder for someone that is making it by themselves  however super efficient  and perfect with organizing baskets
with a little extra effort  this is a good  sturdy shelving unit
i don t want to be too hasty in writing this review  i just got this today  so if anything goes horribly wrong  i ll just   amend it by reviewing the other two of this same unit that i just ordered  a little background  i purchased this unit as a test to see if it would be a good replacement for some seriously sagging bookcases that i bought last year to hold my extensive liquor collection  after checking out the specs and then the reviews  i thought  what the heck   it shipped and arrived fast  i like that  i also like that this unit was easy to put together  i read and followed the instructions carefully and had no trouble putting it together in about 15 minutes  there are a few gripes from negative reviews that i would like to address with this review  yes  one of the shelves was slightly bent on arrival  i took a mallet and straightened it out  problem solved  yes  the little plastic collars that hold the shelves in place are fluted and they have a top and a bottom  install them correctly and you shouldn t have any trouble  the shelves have a top and a bottom too  same thing  is it a tad wobbly when it s finally assembled  sure  so anchor it to the wall  i actually grabbed a 50 metal bracket from the store because i wasn t super impressed with the anchoring device it came with and my workaround works great  i also put some of those furniture slider disks under the legs  worked great for getting it into final position  now the best part  it s sturdy when properly assembled and anchored  i believe it can and will hold the weight it claims to  i have this first one loaded down with rum and it s standing straight and true  oh yeah  the space between the wires on each shelf is significant  so get the shelf liners if you re going to be using this for things like bottles  i ordered some and am making do with cardboard  just cut up the box it came in  until they get here  overall  i like this unit  is it super attractive  no  is it perfect as packaged  no  is it a good value  yes  do i recommend it for simple  easy to assemble shelving needs  yes 
the importance of part e and the shelves
original review i originally gave this product a 1  here s what i said  as other people who gave this product a single star  it s the pieces that the shelves rest on  part e in the list of parts  do not fit well around the vertical poles  hence  the shelves are not securely supported  while the rest of the product are very well constructed and made of metal  these parts are made of cheap plastic  not really up to the quality of the rest of the shelving  updated review went back and read the reviews of people who gave this a  1   i noticed that many seemed to have an issue with part e not connecting completely and then not holding the shelves tightly enough  as i looked at the unstable shelving i had just put together i noticed that the round parts at the four corners of each shelf are larger on one side than the other  then it hit me   if i turned the shelves over  the larger part of the end circles would fit down over part e  keeping part e tight  i had originally put the shelves on so that the lip running around all four edges of the shelves were facing up  i thought to keep things from falling off the shelves   when i turned the shelves over and put it back together it becomes sturdy  because of what i mentioned above  and solid   able to hold the amount of weight listed in the product description  i went from a  1  rating to a  4      i would have given it a  5  but the manufacturer needs to modify the directions explaining the relationship between part e and the shelves  good  clear  well thought out directions can save a company a lot of money  if the directions are clear  support costs decrease and customer satisfaction and loyalty increase 
ok shelving units  quality could be better but they ll work
this is an  ok  shelving unit  i have several of the  hdx  brand ones from hd  the orange store  from years ago  which like all of these are knockoffs of the real  metro  shelving units  i even have some metro brand shelves on my hdx brand units  they re almost identical  i thought  hoped   these shelves were interchangeable  as at  25 each extra shelf it s cheaper to buy 2 full 5 shelf kits and throw away the poles from one to get more shelves  also as hd didn t have units this tall  i planned to take the shelves from my existing hdx ones and use them on these   turns out you can t   these amazonbasics shelves are 34 11 16  between poles  while metro   others are 34 3 8   you just can t install both on one set of poles without bending the poles  in the end  i bought 2 kits  i used all 10 amazonbasics shelves on one unit  and 10 hdx   metro shelves on the other unit s poles  that s not what most people are going to do  so i m not knocking it for that reason  the unfortunate part is the quality just isn t as good as even the hd ones for about the same price  i ve had the hd ones for years   taken apart  moved with me  reassembled multiple times  barely a scratch on the poles  almost all of the amazon poles were scratched just during assembly of the shelves   most likely painted rather than powdercoated  then the grooves on the poles aren t as deep or well defined as the other brands  or maybe full of paint    and the plastic clips have only 1 groove bump vs  2 on the other units  to catch 2 grooves on the pole for more support   so the clips tend to slide down the poles when pounding the shelves on   pound the shelf off  try again  repeat   on one the clip stuck to the shelf hole when it slipped and i had to pound it all the way up the pole past all the other grooves to get it out of the shelf   i found installing a bar clamp squeezed around the pole just under each clip while installing the shelves keeps them in place long enough for them to wedge in tight  once tightly wedged  they seem to hold fine  next the wire gauge is thinner than the other brands  so they don t support as much weight before bending  if you don t have  or haven t seen   used other brands  especially the real metro ones  and can compare them  you probably won t know the difference so long as you don t get one that s overly difficult to get the clips to stay  just be 100  sure the clips are holding before putting too much weight on them  don t overload them and you ll be ok 
read this for instruction help
so this shelf is actually pretty terrific  had a bit of a difficult time setting up mostly because the instruction booklet is really small and hard to see  nor does it seem to be drawn to scale  take a quick glance over the instructions before reading this to get the context and an idea of what you re supposed to do and if you can t figure it out or get stuck  read this  put those little screw in hooves in the poles of the lower legs  after prepping the lower four legs  start by applying the clasps around the second square from the  hoof  of the bottom poles  stick it in the middle of the square and then nudge it upward with your thumb and you should hear feel it snap in place  apply the second clasp directly opposite of the first clasp  keep in mind that they aren t supposed to close on both sides physically impossible   you d think they should and it seems like a lot of people returned their shelves because they thought they were supposed to  but they work just fine without doing so  once you apply the clasps around every leg  you can put the first shelf on  the next main problem is that it doesn t tell you how far apart the shelves should be placed for maximum space on each shelf  i didn t use measuring tape or anything but i started on the second square from the bottom and placed a shelf on every 17th square after that initial second square  the final shelf should be on the last square before upper  hoof   i recommend marking those 17th squares with tape or rubber bands so you don t lose your place as you put them on because it gets harder to count see the squares when the shelves are on top of them 
great  sturdy shelf  slightly annoying to put together 
you definitely need two people to put this together in the beginning if not the whole way to help keep it sturdy during the process  the little clips that you put on to help the shelf stay in place are very annoying in that they don t stay in place very well as you are putting the shelf on  many times they fell off as we were setting the shelf on so we had to scramble to get it off the floor and put back together on the rod  with that said  this is a very sturdy shelving unit once you get it put together and we did flip a couple of the shelves upside down to create that lip for particular items being stored on the shelf  i had to give it a 4 star solely on the fact that it was a slight pain to get together with the little clips and that we had to use a rubber mallet to get the shelves even  as they don t go over the clips evenly  will probably order another one like this because of how sturdy it is  but not looking forward to assembly process 
sturdy enough for price
we put 2 of these in our son s bedroom  he has a camo superhero room  subsequently  we had to create everything from scratch  so  his room is silver and camo green  along with superhero accents  pros  sturdy for toy boxes  3 boxes per shelf   if you buy the liners you can use them as shelves to set things on  clock  piggy bank  etc   nice chrome   no damage  easy enough to assemble  neg  the assembly is a bit odd  not sure why the black locks don t actually connect together  but once you realize that info  it s okay  we bought a second one to match the first 
great shelving unit 
i love this shelving unit  it was easy to put it together by myself  as i was impatient and didn t want to wait for hubby to help put it together  the only complaint i have is the clips if they re not clipped properly  they will fly off  usually as you re trying to put a shelf on them   as i had said  i also put them together on my own  and didn t bother with the instructions   as i was impatient and figured i didn t need them  lol  so  in my haste  i accidentally started putting it together incorrectly  and was using some of the top poles as bottom poles  so i can testify that it does come apart easily  i had already put three shelves on the poles before i realized my error   i bought this to organize my fabrics  as i like to sew and keep all my leftover scraps for future projects  so i can t truly judge how well it handles weight  but it is very sturdy  i can now easily see all the fabric i have and can get it for any sewing project that i want to make
