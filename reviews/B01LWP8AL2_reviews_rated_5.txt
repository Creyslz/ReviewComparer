nice shelf at a great price
i m using this 5 shelf unit in my garage for extra storage  it is well built and was easy to assembly  i didn t have any problems with bent hardware as did some of the other reviewers  take care to make sure you have all 4 sets of wedge clips set at the same height  the poles have double grooves periodically to help you make sure you get all clips at the same height  gently lower the shelf down over the wedge clips  and then push down on each shelf corner while simultaneously pushing up on the wedge clips to make sure they don t slip down on the pole  i accomplish this by putting my palms on the top of the shelf corner and allowing my finger tips to wrap around and touch the bottom of the clips  a bit of squeezing together and the shelf corner rings are making good contact with the clips  keeping them together and prevent them from slipping out of the groove on the pole  easy peasy  i put casters on the bottom of my shelf to allow me to move it around in my garage  i initially ordered casters with a metric threaded shank  m8x1 25   based on responses to product questions on the subject  however  when my shelf arrived i discovered that the threaded inserts were actually a sae thread   3 8 16  coarse thread   so i ordered these casters from amazon https   www amazon com gp product b00tkqcvde ref oh aui search detailpage ie utf8 psc 1 they weren t quite as nice as the metric ones i first bought  no brakes  little more slop in the ball bearing  more expensive  etc   but they worked fine for the shelf and allow me to easily move it around on my smooth garage floor while loaded with boxes  the wheels are fairly small and probably wouldn t work too well on rough finished concrete 
i love my shelf
i love my shelf  it s every sturdy and nice looking  holds everything i needed it to inorder to free up space on my counters 
very easy to install  very strong shelving 
i ve seen a lot of reviews talking about how difficult it is to put the shelving together  perhaps amazon changed the design or something else is going on  but i had zero issues putting the shelf together  aside from determining how much space in between shelves i wanted   this is super easy  1  the shelves  up  side is with the wire lip facing the floor  this lip is there to provide strength to the shelf and prevent it from bending  if you are stuck on needing a  lip  to hold your stuff in  this is not the right shelving system for you  2  the stops for where the shelves rest on say  top  and must be installed in that direction  top toward your ceiling   they are fluted  so if you flip them upside down  they will not hold and your shelf will not stay in place  seriously    that s all the steps involved  like i said  the hardest thing about installation is determining where you want each shelf  total installation  including adjusting shelf heights  took less than 15 minutes  and i am far from a craftsman  stating that  these shelves are super strong  i use mine to store my whiskey collection  these bottles weigh a ton and the entire reason i purchased this shelving system is because the mdf shelving i had was sagging under the weight of the bottles  i highly recommend purchasing the shelf liners that amazon will  suggest  you purchase  there is about an inch gap between each metal wire  the shelf liner will close the gap and prevent things from tipping over and falling  i have some minis on the top shelf and there is no way in the world they would stand up without those liners  the shelf is a semi gloss black  not quite matte  definitely not shiny   it is attractive and should fit most decors  so  five stars for a high quality product at a very attractive price  cheers 
basically amazing shelves  beware suggested shelf liners  though 
as many others have already stated  these shelves are very well built and extremely easy to assemble  the dimensions are thankfully right on the mark  i wanted to place 5 side by side along one wall  and had the dimensions been off by even a small increment they would have overshot a doorway  as you can see in my photos they lined up exactly with the edge of the doorframe  which is precisely what i had intended and pre measured for  only one thing has given me any grief during this project  however  are those sterling shelf liners you see suggested in the  frequently bought together  section  although they claim to be a  perfect fit custom tailored to fit the amazon basics wire shelves by amazonbasics  they are actually about two millimeters too wide to lay properly on the shelves  this slight miscalculation causes the liners to hang over the raised lip edge and could create a slight imbalance depending on the weight of a particular item and how close it is to the offshooting edge  i m not sure how i ll be able to resolve that issue  since the shelf liners are very sturdy  as advertised  so it s not as if i m going to be able to sit down with a pair of scissors and trim all 20 of these things  but that s something that i ll need to take up with sterling themselves  other than that gear grinder  i love these shelves  
awesome 
i wanted to get my storage bins off the floor and this was a perfect fit  easy to put together and looks good and is very solid 
super strong and economical
this is a tall set of 5 shelves which you assemble yourself using plastice brackets  8 metal poles  and 5 shelves  i will mention that this is my second set of amazon basics shelves and this one differs in that it is taller  less wide  and black  i loved the first set and expected this set to be just as good  i m happy to say that they are  though this one has very slightly different construction  first of all  construction on cheap or poorly made versions of this type of shelving can be a nightmare if you re trying to get the shelves level  that is not a problem with these as they are very well made  the plastic caps that allow you to position the shelves and lock them in place are easy both to lock and unlock into place  they also natrually seem to click into certain spots on the ribbed poles so you can easily make sure they fit at even intervals by finding one of those spots on each pole nearest to the desired position  this does mean you can t put the shelves 100  into place if you rely on these locking spots  but it does mean that you don t have to worry about the caps slipping when leveling or placing the shelves and creating uneven shelves  my first set of amazon basics shelves didn t have this clicking into place aspect to the caps  but i was still able to get them level  i think this new feature just makes it easier for people who have difficulties with this type of construction and i think it s a good added new feature  i had no problems at all understanding the instructions or assembling the shelving  they did seem to omit one part  there are double sided metal screws that join the top and bottom poles that you have to screw into the assembled bottom to connect the top poles and those instructions seemed unclear or absent  my former set of shelves screwed directly into one another  i think this design is likely stronger and more stable  and may apply only to these shelves because they are taller than the other set that i have   you do need to supply either a rubber mallet or a hammer and some sort of cushioning cloth to gently tap the shelves into place over the caps  you can probably do it with your fist and a cloth  but it ll be a little uncomfortable doing so  you really don t need to hit them hard to get them to fit the caps  all of the parts on these shelves are very solid with good heft  i am keeping very heavy things on my shelves  at present  about 12 cases of soda are on one shelf  and they do not bend  sag or sway  the shelves can take a lot of weight  i have no doubt that they can hold at least the 350 lbs  of distributed weight that the description claims  anchoring materials are also included should you be in a position to worry about the shelves toppling  i can t speak to the anchoring materials utility since i am renting and can t drill holes in my walls  that being said  i also don t think the shelf is likely to tip even with an earthquake as long as you bottom load the heaviest items to help anchor the shelf  the main concern would be small children trying to climb up it  and that s no a concern for me   some people have put up pictures of damaged shelves  i had no problems with mine  they were all straight with perfect paint jobs on them and no rusting issues  i did note that the box took a little damage in transit  despite being a big box within a much bigger box  so i wonder if rough handling in transit may have created problems for some users  in terms of value  these provide an enormous amount of space and strong shelves for a bargain price  the only weak point is an obvious one based on design  and not related to the product s quality or construction so it is not a demerit as you can see the type of shelving you are getting when you make a choice to buy these  and that is that they are open shelves so you ll need storage bins or bookends to keep certain items from falling out the sides  i ve found that you can deal with the open metal framework on the bottom easily by cutting out pieces of cardboard and covering the bottoms of the shelves with decorative cloth  these look good and function very well and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for economical  high capacity  strong shelves provided that you believe you are okay with self assembly  i ve been extremely pleased with my first set of amazon basics shelves for nearly a year and these seem just as solid as those ones 
    my appliances so i bought this shelf which is sturdy and doesn t occupy too much space

new york living   shelves needed
i love these shelves  i live in ny and with lack of closets comes a major need for storage  these shelves look good in every room  this latest one is in my bedroom 
perfect for additional shelf space
i was looking for additional shelf space for my smaller kitchen appliances and found this item  it took less than ten minutes to put together and is very sturdy  i especially like that you can adjust the bottom of the unit  my tile floor is somewhat uneven and changing one side made it stop wobbling   this was just what i was looking for 
sturdy 
this shelving unit is wonderful  my husband has a lot of heavy books that just weren t fitting on his bookshelves  so i bought him this  we have to shelve the books sideways  but he actually likes it because now he doesn t have to tilt his head when he s reading the titles   haha  love the brushed black finish   very sturdy           
amazing
love itttt   was looking for a shelf for my son s bedroom for his tv and clothes all the dressers costs about 300 bucks this is strong perfect for 50 bucks super easy to put together   
great set of shelves  neg review take with grain of salt
okay  first of all this shelving unit is absolutely great  the price is great for the quality you get  the assembly is easy  as long as you follow directions and put the shelves on correctly  it holds my microwave  countertop devices and some dishes and pans  as to other reviews saying things are broken or it doesn t fit together all i have to say is read the directions so you can assemble it properly  the complaints that the plastic pieces that go on the rails to hold the shelves not fitting together completely  that is how they are suppsed to be  they need to have a space so they can provide pressure when the shelf is put on it  as to having to use a hammer to set the shelves  yes that is normal  again it needs the pressure to stay in place so it most likely shelves won t go on with hand pressure  as to the broken pieces loose in the box  they are shipping shims to keep the shelves separate  these pieces are not needed for assembly  again read the directions  i saw a couple of pictures with crooked shelves  this is due to not having the plastic pole pieces at the same level  use a measuring tape to be sure they are all at the same level  there is also one picture that is all jacked up with shelves all over the place  this person assembled incorrectly  the shelves only go on one way  the four corner holes are tapered and need to be put on the poles tapered side up  the easiest way to figure it out is the part than hangs down about an inch from the shelf should be facing down  if you put it the other way the shelves will not go on correctly  i have assembled these type of shelves in the restaurant industry and i find a lot of the negative reviews to be the fault of the assembler  the damaged product reviews are different  however  that is not the fault of the product or amazon that is 100  the shipping company  i hate when people blame amazon for something they have zero control over  overall  i recommnd these shelves  they are sturdy and have a lot of room for storage  i do wish they were a little deeper  but it works great fir my needs 
great shelf for garage or indoor closet
sturdy  adjustable metal shelves  great for organizing open or closed closet space  i put this inside my small closet to put away my 14 gal  56qt    4 gal  16qt  plastic storage bins  initially i had these storage containers stacked  but the weight of top bins was cracking the bottom most bin  and causing lids to warp  in addition  if i needed something from bottom bin  i had to remove all the top bins first  the metal shelves allowed to all buckets bins to be separate so they don t break from stacked weight and contents in them are now easily accessible  i love this shelf  
great  sturdy and easy to put together 
so sturdy yet lightweight and just snaps together  i use mine in a closet to store art supplies  i have slate tiles and ceramic tiles that weigh a lot and this shelf saves me space and holds all that weight  i bought one that was so expensive from u line once 
sturdy  multi purpose unit
multi purpose shelving unit  no complaints  it arrived on time and packaged well  i was able to quickly assemble the unit and put it to use  i bought this to store items in my garage  but it looks nice enough to use indoors as well  the only difficulty i had was with the placing some of the sleeves where i wanted  for some reason certain sets would not easily clip together  fortunately  the package came with spare sleeves and i was able to mix and match the pairs to fit as needed  at one point i had to readjust the middle shelf height and was able to do that easily as well 
great product for the money
this product is just what i needed for my daughters homeschool textbooks  it is sturdy and can hold the weight with no problem  the only pain was putting it together which really only took all of ten minutes  it was the exact dimensions i needed for the space i was using  i use the top shelf for my printer and it is sturdy enough for that  modern design looks great in the home 
assemble in no time 
easy to assemble nice looking shelf for kitchen closet or wherever 
great product
at first i was not sure if i would like a steel shelving system compared to a wooden one in my bedroom  now they stand right next to my old sauder s shelves and they do not look bad  comes with a bonus that i do not have to worry about the weight i subject them to   pros  1  the shelves are made of steel  you can sit on it and it will not bend  it bends flexes a little if you stand on it  like any steel product  yes  i tried it while it was partially assembled to make sure i do not get any surprises at night  the sleeves did not break either  the 4 vertical hollow posts or legs holding the shelves are also steel  equally sturdy  each vertical leg comes in two pieces and the joints go in tight  this product is solidly built  so  great value for money  now i have 3 of these shelves  someone commented the plastic sleeves keep sliding down  but i did not have any problems   you just need to be a little careful in placing them  also  i assembled the shelves upside down  i e  with the  lip  side down so i can stack more and easily slide off the boxes when needed  engineering wise  i do not see any problems either way you assemble it  2  legs have small plastic feet to keep it from scratching floors  will they crack and break  only time will tell  3  assembly was very easy and the instructions clear  the assembled product was not wobbly  unstable  4  shelves can be easily located at every 1 inch distance  the 4 metal tubes at the end of each shelf jam into 4 black plastic sleeves that you see in the picture  relocating the shelves later was also easy  after using for an entire day  we decided to change the levels for better stacking  the sleeves and the shelves did not jam up and the change was easy to make  5  looks good for a dorm room  bedroom  or a garage  cons  1  goes 3ft wide by 4 1 2 ft high  would have preferred at least 5 1 2 ft high 
my best friend in terms of storage for the kitchen
god  i love this shelving unit  it s not much to look at  but no wire anything is much to look at  let s agree on that much  but this unit is sturdy as can be at a price point that is unbelievable  to buy something of this strength and capable of this weight would normally cost  300  in my experience  originally  i purchased this last year because i was so sick and tired of going out to the garage to get my vitamix  or kitchenaid mixer  crockpot  etc  but my kitchen didn t have enough cabinet space to house it all and i am 100  anti clutter on the countertops  nothing makes a kitchen look messier than lots of stuff on the countertop  no matter how nice the appliance  so  i looked for a temporary and cheap option on which i can just put my appliances and call it a day  i gave no consideration to appearance because it was going to be put in a side sitting area  out of clear view from the kitchen  so this amazonbasics shelving unit fit the bill in price and utility  but once we put this together  which was easy    it proved to be such a huge plus and assistant in my kitchen life  from canister of various types of flour  sugar  etc  i filled the top rack and the second and third rack was used to my mixers  food processors and other items i pull out regularly to prevent my having to bend over to get it   if you ve ever picked up a kitchenaid mixer  you d know how heavy that monster is   on the bottom rack  i put two large plastic tubs with covers to keep them closed  one was full of various spices and other ingredients that don t require refrigeration but i use infrequently enough that i don t need it in my cabinets  the other was full of dog food  dog treats  dog stuff in general like the exorbitantly priced kong cheese whiz like things  and so forth  the two plastic containers kept it looking neat and organized  and the shelf had no problems carrying all of this stuff  and then i recently moved  as my movers were bringing stuff in  i got to unpacking my kitchen like i always do first but as appliances emerged  i waited and waited for this damn shelf to be brought it  wouldn t you know it    someone stole the entire shelf from the loading area  granted  the problem was most likely that of my movers who left it out there like trash  but this and a few other items were stolen once they took it off the truck and left it on the curb  after i decided not to kill them on the spot because they just weren t worth going to jail for  i got to ordering the shelf immediately  there was no looking at other shelves  i wanted this shelf and i wanted it now  while i didn t opt for next day delivery  i did use my prime and before i knew it  the shelf was here  built and i could finally organize my kitchen  at my current place  much like my previous house  this shelving unit is in a adjacent room  in this case a storage and laundry room that i have  it s a perfect size for placement against one of the walls and houses basically the same things i had on it before  alongside another outdoor large shelving i had that i now use for pantry items  highly recommend  oddly  the second shelf i bought is less adjustable than the first  i was trying to put one shelf a little higher than the others and it wouldn t lock in place as securely as my previous shelf had done  so this time  i kept it exactly as shown with evenly spaced shelving  which wasn t a big deal but it s something to keep in mind  it doesn t take away from its function or utility in any way and i could not recommend it more  get this shelf 
perfect for my tiny kitchen art studio
perfect for my tiny kitchen art studio  just as pictured and easy to put together  i bought the plastic shelf sheets amazon suggested with this and they fit perfect 
these shelves are the perfect item for our purpose and at a better price    
these shelves are the perfect item for our purpose and at a better price than home depot  easy to assemble with one person    
great way to add shelving 
my closet had three shelves in it    very high shelves and for the most part  useless  so  i ripped them out and replaced them with this unit  i had to  build  the shelves inside of the closet because they wouldn t fit through the door after being constructed  it was very easy to put together and i like that i could set the height for each shelf  i needed space to put a large container under the bottom shelf and with this being adjustable  i was able to do that  i have doubled my closet space and love the unit  it looks very classy and it also very sturdy  well worth the money  originally  i was going to put wire rack shelving that attaches to the wall  but  after adding up the cost for the 5 shelves  the mounting brackets that go on the wall  and the  arms  that hold up the shelf  it came to well over  100  this unit was a much better idea overall 
perfect for outside organization  
i purchased this shelf to help organize my backyard  i really loved the final product  i ll list the other items below in case anyone would like to replicate this idea  the shelf has worked perfectly  we also attached the frame to the wall  absolutely mandatory with small kids   it comes with hardware to attach  the outside was a chaotic mess and visually disturbing  i used this shelf to organize and it s working perfect  here are the vinyl stickers  they are permanent and have held up amazing in our 1    degree weather  duro decal permanent adhesive vinyl letters   numbers  3  gothic black here are the buckets amazonbasics 5 shelf shelving unit   black the four buckets are weather proof  rust proof with locking kids  the lids were key  for me  because most ideas i saw involved open containers  i didn t want water  leaves  dirt etc accumulating inside  the letters were  6 and these were the hardest part actually  lining them up  finding the right spacing and figuring out what to include was tricky  the letters are permanent and designed to be used outside  i left room for more buckets   storage later as their toys and interest shift 
the black color makes this shelf cool and also prevents any unintentional conduction of electricity
this shelf is beautify and stable  the black color makes this shelf cool and also prevents any unintentional conduction of electricity  this shelf does not include screws which are hard to implement and easy to lose  you only need to connect 2 parts together around the stick  the small parts are noted which side is top  and then put the board from top  so easy and simple  and this design of implementation also ensures its stability 
great space saver 
so far i love it  i wanted something to hold my bigger cooking appliances that were crowding my counters  this works perfectly for my needs and my kitchen looks less cluttered  i will update later if needed  i do have a second one i plan to utilize in my garage 
you will not regret this purchase 
love  love  love  i felt like my kitchen walls were caving in on me  my kitchen is laughably small to begin with  with no counter space to speak of  and almost no cabinet space    things would be  put away  and not a few hours later the counters would be covered in random things from everyone in the house and cooking or accomplishing anything in the kitchen would be near impossible  while dreams of a wrecking crew coming through and demolishing and starting from scratch were lovely  they were just that  pipe dreams    we did what we could  bought one of these and extended our counter with a commercial food prep table  oh the difference  i feel like i have a new kitchen   this has added an immense amount of storage space and allowed me to store some of my space hogging but much needed things like my beloved kitchenaid mixer  dry goods  etc etc etc    it s sturdy  assembled like a breeze  i did it by myself    and the price was right  if you re on the fence  do yourself the favor  get it    i m already contemplating purchasing more for other purposes around the house  great product 
five stars
fits my closet perfectly
perfect 
very happy with my purchase  my pantry was looking like a disaster with all my daughters snacks and water bottles all over the floor  the rack fits perfect in the pantry  not too wide or narrow  so far the rack seems strong enough to hold some of our snacks and 100 bottles of water  the shelf is big enough for me to have about 80 bottles stacked on one shelf 
exactly what i wanted  great deal
we live in a condo with no garage so storage space is the constant problem  i wanted more shelves in the closet without spending  60  on shelving systems they have at home depot  this was perfect  very sturdy and functional  easy set up  gave much more space and still able to hang coats in the closet  i shop on amazon a lot and this was one of the best purchases ive made
easy assembly and sturdy design
these shelves are great  i use them in my storage room so i can get more in there  total time to put completely together was about 30 or so minutes with help from my wife  the biggest issue i had was figuring out where to put the clips  i thought they didn t fit because they wouldn t clip together but there are slots on the poles that hold them together  that issue took a few minutes to figure out so it wasn t a big deal  i personally felt like the construction of the product is good  overall  easy to assemble and a sturdy product  i recommend this to anyone looking for shelves that aren t a ridiculous price 
great product
shelving came nicely packed  there are very few pieces to it and assembling is obvious  there are 4 rods for lower part of the shelving and 4 rods for higher part of the shelving  they have to be screwed together and connector is metallic and very durable  there are also 4 wire shelves and you need 32 plastic half pieces to put all shelves into the place at the height of your choice  package includes 34 of these pieces to assure assembly even in the very unlikely case of you breaking up to 2 of them  printed assembly manual is included  but you hardly need it at all  assembling process is very easy  i would say 15 minutes for 1 person and under 5 minutes for 2 people with second person would keep shelf more or less horizontally while you secure each of the 4 sides of the shelf  being fully assembled  this shelving feels solid  looks great and indeed saves lots of space 
solid  strong alternative for a bookcase
purchased this unit along with the sterling brand shelf liners  which fit this unit perfectly  and am extremely happy with how this came out  i was looking for more living room storage space for heavy books  games and other items  affordable bookcases all would sag under the weights i wanted to place on the shelves and i didn t want to pay  300  for a good  solid wood bookcase  this unit with the shelf liners looks amazing in the space and i can pile loads of weight on each shelf with no fear of any sag  a great affordable solution for my needs  i was able to easily put it together by myself  2 people might make it a little easier to start   i was easily able to make a couple of shelf height adjustments after the unit was completed  again 2 people might make it even easier   once up and in place it feels very solid  i like the leveling feet as my wood flooring is a little uneven near the wall i was placing it on  i have since ordered the matching 4 shelf shelving unit to place next to this one 
great deal
for  45 00 this is a steal  i bought service caster pre20634zn tpu 4 caster with 3 8  threaded stem  non marking polyurethane wheel  2  size  pack of 4  for it  so it wold be easier to move around  as someone who works in a commercial kitchen  i was looking for something to store bulkier items on  to free up counter space and make my small apartment kitchen more workable  and less annoying  liked it so much that i purchased a second unit  my food processor  toaster oven  heavier pans  sous vide equipment  bulk rice containers  immersion blender  etc  have found a new home  also all my cookbooks reside on these shelves  along with other books which were formerly stacked in piles on the floor in front of a bookshelf  it is so inexpensive that i m even toying with the idea of getting a third one  possibly just to be able to add an extra shelf to each of the ones i already have  highly recommend this item  especially for apartment dwellers who might move frequently  as this type of shelving is very sturdy  modular  adaptable  and compact when disassembled 
this shelving unit is very sturdy and is holding up excellently with a lot of    
this shelving unit is very sturdy and is holding up excellently with a lot of stuff on it  this shelving unit was a little tricky to put together and itll be easier for you to put together if you read this review  theres a couple of things you need to know  1  the bag of black plastic interlocking pieces needed both pointed to the top and then you put them on the shelving unit near the double ridge lines on the poles and if you move them up or down  depending on where you put the two interlocking pieces  youll hear them snap in place with a clicking sound and you wont be able to easily move them up or down without taking the two pieces apart  2  this is a lot easier to put together with two people  that said  i put it together alone and it wasnt too bad  3  there is a right way and a wrong way to put the shelves onto the black interlocking pieces  if they dont seem to fit in easily  you put it on the wrong way  theres really no other way to tell than that as far as im aware  this is a great shelving unit thats worth the money if you want shelves to put stuff on 
turned my coat closet into a pantry
my apartment didnt come with a pantry and i need one so i bought this unit assembled it myself took 30 minutes  turned my coat closet into a pantry 
this was extremely easy to put together
this was extremely easy to put together  i was worried that it would be confusing based on earlier reviews  i did watch the youtube video before opening the package  looked easy  and it was  i think amazon read the earlier reviews about the shelf stops being difficult to figure out which way the go  because it looks like they improved the product  not sure if the earlier product had this  but my unit s shelf stop clips had an arrow that pointed up on both sides so i knew exactly how to position the clips  i did notice the arrow on the clips in the video as well  i knew i needed more than one unit but was hesitant to buy more based on some of the reviews  now that i know how simple the unit is to assemble  i will be buying another one 
great little shelving
this is exactly what i needed  was a bit tricky putting it together and i have many spare parts left over   however it seems very sturdy  i struggled for awhile until i went and looked at other people s reviews and comments and one person said to put it together upside down  and that was the most helpful   it went together like a piece of cake then  was easy  have no idea where that saying came from  i have one extra sleeve packaged separately and 8 cap like things i never used   not sure where they were supposed to go  since the sleeves didn t totally fit tight snapping together i put a small piece of monster tape to keep them together   prob due to arthritic hands  still mystified by the caps though as everything is covered and sturdy  when putting together seemed wobbly at times  but once it was standing upright it was tight and firm as could be  so i give this 5 stars   definitely worth the low price   d even an ole gal like myself can do it   73   d
this is a bargain
wow  what a bargain  this is actually a seville shelving unit sold under the amazonbasics name  i have four huge shelving units in my basement for storage and i bought this small guy to put between my stove and sink  here s the deal  i have read all the one star reviews and i can tell you that those reviews are written by people who either didn t read the assembly instructions or who just don t know how to follow them  same goes for the 4 huge seville shelving units i now have in my basement  all four are great  again  i can see how people can complain that parts don t fit all because they were too lazy to read the instructions  this is one great shelving unit at a very low price  buy it and make sure you have the plastic parts snapped into the grooves and right side up and you are in business
i was a bit worried because i usually pay more for the units but these are really nice  i m 70 and only 5 feet tall
my unit arrived today and i put it together soon after  i already  had eight others similar ones  so i m quite experience doing so  this actually feel quite strong  i was a bit worried because i usually pay more for the units but these are really nice  i m 70 and only 5 feet tall  so anyone can do it  the others that i already had are a different brand  but i m guessing the same people make them  because the parts are almost identical  i have had some for a decade 
easy to assemble my five year old even helped
fits perfectly in the garage  easy to assemble my five year old even helped 
sturdy with multiple uses 
i m commenting on the chrome 3 shelf unit   sturdy  quick to assemble if you do it correctly  enclosed instructions too small to read    thus  take heed   you must assemble these shelves with the  lip  side down   i tried assembly w  lip side up  but that did not work   the lip  side  must be down  and the little plastic  anchors  must face up  see the arrow on the plastic anchor   the arrows on each half of the plastic anchors must be pointed up    the lip i m referring to runs around all 4 sides of each shelf   i might not be very clear with this  but when you see the shelves  it should be apparent as to what you need to do  someone posted a couple of video clips on this listing that will be more helpful  so  the chrome    20 00 is a great buy  i would definitely purchased this item again  take care 
best shelving for quality and price
this is an excellent buy  in fact it is the second one i purchased  i would call this a medium weight shelving unit  others costing double are really heavy duty and suitable really for industrial or professional use  this weight is perfect for home use and can really hold a lot of weight  the size  circumference  of the legs is the same as the heavy weight professional units so you can mix and match  i bought the 54  one and each leg comes as 2 pieces that screw together  in other words 8 pieces for the 4 legs so if you ever decide you want a shorter unit it is easily converted  simple to put together  excellent value 
it s great  i love it
it s great  i love it  i have a ton of kitchen appliances in a tiny apartment and this has given me so much more room  it s sturdy and the feet are adjustable so you can make it level on an uneven floor  or even tip it back toward the wall a little  the black sleeves that hold the shelves up are all slightly different sizes so some of the shelves aren t perfectly straight  and i wish that there were a counter height version of this shelf  last i looked there was this tiny one  then one that s like six feet tall  i wanted a four shelf unit to hold everything i do with this one  plus my microwave on top  but still  love this  it s a great deal and really useful  i can t believe it can hold so much weight 
very awesome shelf unit
we have purchased the larger size of this similar shelf unit from costco in 2007  wife was looking for something smaller to put not often used kitchen items and found this unit  she assembled it together without issues  the main issue she came across was not putting the shelves at the right height to leave enough space for the items and had to adjust them afterwards 
amazonbasics 5 shelf shelving unit is good looking  super strong  and is a great value   i highly recommend it  
the amazonbasics 5 shelf shelving unit is extremely well built  can handle most of anyone s weigh capacity needs  decorative shelf trim doubles as additional lateral support  only drawback  get some help  holding items  when assembling  i consider myself as a coordinated person     i ended up putting it on its side during assembly     worked out fine  after using a tape measure to adjust each shelf  i set the unit upright and started at the bottom   up     using a medium rubber hammer  over a board  to tap each corner of the shelves     locking them into the well designed shelf supports  they can support a lot of weight  continue tapping each shelf   support until you reach the top one  once all are locked in     this unit is super sturdy  can go back to adjust   change heights any time     very  very easy  i highly recommend this amazonbasics wall shelving unit  excellent aesthetics  and super value 
4 shelf shelving unit in black
purchased this shelving unit in black to hold outdoor potted plants like rosemary and other herbs inside the house over the winter  adjusted some of the shelves to accommodate the different heights of the plants  placed on each of the shelves  instead of using individual pot saucers  inexpensive black long plastic trays meant for shoes that are wet or muddy from the outdoors to catch any drips after watering the plants  shelving was easy to put together  is sturdy  plus looks great and with no scratches or damage from shipping  i was thrilled about that  next spring when i can take the plants back outside  i plan on using the shelving in the pantry room for short term storage items until the next time i bring the plants inside  i like this shelving so much that i might have to purchase another 
great shelving and easy to assemble
great shelving units  strong  stable  they go together very easily once you catch on  the instructions themselves are barely helpful  as usual  no mention  for example  of the fact that the plastic grommets in the legs are only there for shipping purposes and should be thrown away  the little plastic pieces  which come in sealed bags  that hold the shelving in position on the legs only go together one way and  click  into place  you just have to pay attention to which end is up  as i said  once you catch on  the units go up easily and quickly  
great product  very  very  very hard instructions to follow  be prepared  have a soft drink or something before hand 
well  this product  after its been put together  is pretty good  there is a real problem with putting this bad boy together  the first 30 minutes i was so pissed at the seller  amazon basic  that i had to stop myself from writing this review with 1 star  there are 3 or 4 problems with putting this together  one  the instruction manual is just a little smaller than a playing card  yes   with such small print  it s hard to follow  if you look at the pictures on the product page  you ll see two clips that hold the shelves in place on each pole  this is the real head ache  make sure you put the shelf on with the flat side up  then the shelf fits over the two halves but not all the way  it catches  so  especially the bottom  you have to make sure that all the clips around the poles are on the same distance so that the shelf is even  do this and you ve got it licked  i can t help but wonder why someone associated with this product does not make a quick web video showing how to put this together  this  if not making this shelf more user friendly  would at least make amazonbasic come across better 
one of the best priced and built wire shelving units out there 
for those needing a simple and sturdy wire shelf  this amazonbasics 4 shelf unit is one of the best product out there for its class  i would highly recommend this to anyone need such a simple shelf without the hassle  i bought this shelf to put inside my closet that lacked a shelving system  compared to many of the other brands out on amazon and other major stores  this shelf is one of the most affordable  possibly the cheapest when i bought it  units of its size  to simply break it down  pros   possibly the cheapest product for its size and offering compared to other brands and stores  very sturdy   specs say it s rated at 350lbs per shelf loaded evenly   i ve filled mine with textbooks and other heavy stuff with no issues  shelves are height adjustable with simple  sturdy plastic clips that can be positioned however you like  the bottom of the whole shelving unit has adjustable legs in case you have uneven flooring  very easy to assemble   possible to do it with only one person   the unit itself is light weight   can move around with one person   as with any brand type of shelf  do store the heaviest biggest items on the bottom shelf first cons   unless i m not a very picky person  i can t find any cons to this product  other considerations   my packaging looked like it was handled roughly during transit  but since the item itself was sturdy  there were no issues  this concerns is primarily focused at the shippers  not amazon itself  your experience with the packaging may vary 
this is an excellent  solid   sturdy shelf
took me a few tried to figure out how all the pieces fit together even with the guide  but the end result was definitely worth the effort  this is an excellent  solid   sturdy shelf  it holds an incredible amount of weight and looks wonderful in our kitchen  i am going to order a new one because of how crowded our kitchen counters and cabinets has gotten  don t believe the few bad reviews you may have read  most of them are from people who can t read instructions or didn t try very hard to figure out the few parts that may require some more detailed instructions 
easy assembly and great price with prime shipping
these shelves are great and easy to put together if you follow the instructions  one thing i did differently from the instructions was that i turned it upside down to get the first shelf on  setting the shelf on my lap upside down and just inserting each pole  then i flipped it over and finished it  when it arrived  a few of the plastic protection rings were destroyed  they get thrown away anyway  so no big deal  however  at least one of the shelves was very slightly deformed upon arrival  it was barely noticeable and wouldn t affect anything  though  this was my first amazon basics purchase and i m pretty happy with it  i d give it 4 75 stars if possible  but i ll round up  now if i could just buy one more shelf piece with the connectors to add to this  it would be perfect 
clever design  and rock solid
a very solid nice shelf unit for wherever you need one  not flimsy like many are  the instructions are minimal and if you are not intuitive and have experience assembling things  you should ask a friend over   who is  to help  it helps to study it and understand why it is built they way it is  that is  the parts themselves  the design is intelligent and modern  and does work quite well  i like mine a lot  i would recommend it to anyone  just be sure you have the right person assemble  it might be very frustrating for some  but  many great things are  i could build a second one in 15 20 minutes  now that i understand the design  i highly recommend it  the price is great  excellent quality as well 
amazing shelf for the price 
great quality shelf  works for my needs in the garage  will be picking up more  there are plastic stand offs of some kind that sit i think on each of the circle corners during shipping  those were busted apart upon arrival and i thought they were needed  but they are only for shipping and say in the instructions to discard them  other then that  they include 2 extra plastic inserts as spares  nice looking sturdy shelf for the price  will definitely buy again 
one of the best products i have ever bought
this is by far  one of the best products i have ever bought  its amazingly strong  i was able to bring it in my house  set it up all by myself  i bought the shelf liners which i recommend  i have this set up along one of the walls in my kitchen and is holding  my pressure cooker  my crock pot  my blenders and lovely white accent boxes  it has brought organization to my kitchen because i have nothing on my counters any more  very pleased  happy in ny 
worth it
i was able to put it together by myself  was not hard  it s very stable  holds all the pots and pans 
look nice  sturdy  easy assemble
i needed some shelves to hold kitchen appliances  as i have a shortage of cabinet space  i plan to build more cabinets so i didn t want to plunk too much money down on shelves that would be upgraded in a few years  i wanted them to look nice and be sturdy  these shelves fit the bill  they hold a heavy standing mixer and a heavy pressure cooker in addition to a variety of other odds and ends  you can adjust the heights pretty easily  so my smaller appliances don t have to take up as much vertical space  they look nice  even nice enough for a modern kitchen setup   not the style i ll have  unfortunately for the shelves   my kids have bonked into them a couple times without toppling them over  assembly was easy  and spare parts were included just in case  i could see these eventually going in the pantry to hold cans or jars of pickles  or perhaps in the workshop to help organize tools or something 
highly recommended
i bought two of these for my garage to store things as i have no room in my apartment  my brother was here the day we put them together and now the word is spreading  he wants some too  i was surprised by the sturdiness and quality of this item  i expected something that wiggled and didn t hold anything  not the case  this is fantastic  i waited till they came back in stock and ordered another one for my garage  it should be here today  please keep in mind  i m only stockpiling on toilet paper and other light products 
instructions were less than helpful  great product   
it took me a minute to figure out the instructions  but once i got the hang of it it was super easy to put together  15 min tops  the key is that the lip has to be facing down otherwise it wont work  the clips dont snap in place together  but thats part of how the shelves stay up  honestly the instructions made it way more confusing than necessary  very sturdy  pretty lightweight  adjustable  a 
a basic necessity  easy to put together 
this was a snap to put together  it s incredibly sturdy  and actually looks fairly decent  my roommate and i had it unpacked and assembled in about 10 minutes  and it could be done by one person easily too   i m using it in my entryway as an annex to pantry items and bulk goods like paper towels  i made the bottom shelf tall enough to accommodate a bin for recycling  the one thing to note  as i learned from another reviewer is to make sure you re installing the shelves with the lip down    otherwise  the shelves won t catch properly on the little snaps on the poles  the lip isn t a lip to prevent things from falling off your shelves  it s decorative  and if you try to install with the lip up  you ll have trouble 
great shelves  great price  easy to construct and adjust 
i ve now put 5 of these together  they re strong  sturdy  and easy to construct  they have adjustable feet so they re easy to stabilize  they offer plenty of storage on the shelves  and below the bottom shelf too   i also hang tools underneath the edges to increase my storage space  i don t know how much weight they ll support  but i can tell you i keep a lot of stuff on them and they re perfectly stable  i do keep the heavy things on the bottom and the lighter things on top  but i ve never been worried about a collapse or a topple 
worth every penny
great quality and my husband said it was easy to put together  it really cleaned up our closet  great product and a good bargain 
its sturdy and didn t take too much time to setup
i bought this to organize and clear up space in my garage  its sturdy and didn t take too much time to setup  no more clutter around the garage  i d buy more of these for organization 
didn t get to keep it for myself
the least thing i liked about it  was it wasn t easy to put together with just me doing it  the hardest part was holding the shelves up while getting them on the frame  the clamp kept on popping off until i could get the shelves slid down on them  the other thing was making sure they were even as you had to count the marks on the frame itself to make sure both sides of the shelf were at the same height  the bad thing about it was  i didn t get to keep the shelf after i had put it together  my wife took one look at it and decided she had to have it for her crafting room  lol  have to admit  it does look good there even though i will now have to order another for me  overall i am happy with buying it and will definitely order another one for me now 
this is a sturdy rack and holds food
this is a sturdy rack and holds food  blenders  and even a cast iron wok  as long as you put it together correctly  you will have no problems  my husband walked up and started to help me put it together and just put the clamps on with out looking a the directions and put them on upside down  he was irritated right off the bat when they flew off when trying to put the shelf down secure  once he turned them around  no problems
