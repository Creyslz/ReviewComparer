big mistake  very unhappy 
would give this 0 stars if possible  this is the first review i have ever written on any product because i usually have no trouble with purchases from amazon  i purchased this computer through sj computers llc  the computer was incredibly slow and would not bring up an internet server  we needed up trying an internet extender thinking it was our wi fi but every other tablet and laptop worked just fine in the same location but this computer would not  tried to return it but the company would not accept it back  so here we are out 100 dollars with nothing to show  i would say this would be a risky buy  horrible customer service as well 
power switch doesn t work
the power switch doesn t work     so i have to turn it on by plugging it in and unplugging it  very disappointed 
dont buy
my computer wont connect to the internet and is very slow  i should have saved my money and just got a new one  what do i do with a computer that doesnt work  ugh 
waste of my time
didnt even come on the lights just lit up and the fan whirred like a hundred dollar noise machine returning
worked fine for a month or so
worked fine for a month or so  basically long enough to be out of warranty  bad power supply and my reply was ship it back on my dime and repair on my dime or take to a local computer shop  not sure if its dell to blame or the company  both aren t looking too well in my book 
very used and old
it looked very used  and the machine manufacturer date was in 2010  besides it was damaged when it got to me  i returned it i wouldn t buy it again
don t waste your time   please  
i got this as a prime item  and it came longer   i finally get it and the damn thing comes broken   falling apart  no lie

one star
item did not work at all
not recommended
dishonest description and defective product 
i got what i paid for   
shorts on both the psu and the motherboard causes it to randomly power on or off 
sent it back 
i am a cheapskate and have bought many used computers over the years  i knew as soon as i took it out of the box that it was not what i wanted to deal with  it still had the previous owner s info  documents  pictures  ect  the usb ports were difficult to use  like they were warped  it came with an internet adapter  not the built in wireless that i wanted  i sent it back within a few days  and i am the type of person that never sends anything back or returns stuff to stores  i just knew it was not for me  i decided to not waste my money and bought a new pc that arrived today 
dell
i am u happy with my computer  it doesn t have any better features than my old one  slow as the old one
