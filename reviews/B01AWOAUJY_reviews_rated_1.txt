big mistake  very unhappy 
would give this 0 stars if possible  this is the first review i have ever written on any product because i usually have no trouble with purchases from amazon  i purchased this computer through sj computers llc  the computer was incredibly slow and would not bring up an internet server  we needed up trying an internet extender thinking it was our wi fi but every other tablet and laptop worked just fine in the same location but this computer would not  tried to return it but the company would not accept it back  so here we are out 100 dollars with nothing to show  i would say this would be a risky buy  horrible customer service as well 
other than that it works fine  i bought this one on specs
description as 2 9 ghz is incorrect  it is 2 19  other than that it works fine  i bought this one on specs  there was another refurb with better specs from another seller or 2  so this looks like deception to beat competitors 
pure junk
really  wow  what a scam  dont waste your time like i did 
one star
arrived defective  will not power on  shows amber power light and flashes 234
dont buy
my computer wont connect to the internet and is very slow  i should have saved my money and just got a new one  what do i do with a computer that doesnt work  ugh 
power switch doesn t work
the power switch doesn t work     so i have to turn it on by plugging it in and unplugging it  very disappointed
