worked fine for a year  then a vertical purple line appeared in the middle of the screen  others seem to have had the same issue  not sure if it is a common problem with monitors those days  but this is the first time i have had a monitor do that  it s still usable i guess  but i wouldn t recommend buying that screen 
good quality  poor performance
i purchased two of these monitors from amazon  i thought that the price indicated i was buying a  utility  grade monitor  in my opinion  they aren t that good  pros  these monitors look good  both on stills and hd video  brightness  contrast  colorimetry and resolution are all good  they are very light weight with a substantial base  not adjustable   cons   1  sometimes they will flash between video and black screen with certain video content  i think when video contains lots of white   2  they emit radio interference  i first noticed this when my cordless mouse developed  dead spots  on the mouse pad  i went to a corded mouse to fix the problem  second  people couldn t understand me when i talked on my cordless phone while setting at my computer  they said my voice was very garbled  when i stepped back from the monitors a couple steps my phone worked okay  these monitors are not sufficient quality for office or frequent home use  they would work okay for utility use  email receipt  etc 
display is not good
i ve had this monitor for nearly 8 months  but for the last 4 months it s had an issue with waking up purple  i have it attached to my imac with a new cord and it does the same thing as the old cord  when i power it off and back on  it does flicker a lot as other reviewers said  but then it s fine and color is good  but  if i leave the computer and it goes into sleep mode  as soon as i move the mouse to wake up  it s purple  giving it 2 stars because at least the color is really good when it s not purple  and it s fixable with the powering off on  the photo makes it look green  but you can see the comparison to the screen next to it 
good price  but for a reason
good price  but for a reason  great resolution  but it doesn t always connect  purchased for my home office and about half the time i have trouble connecting  it says no signal even though it s clearly plugged in  even when i unplug and replug everything  i thought it was a bad vga cable and amazon support was nice enough to send me an hdmi cable but it still continues to happen  don t bother with hp support   that was a huge waste of time  amazon support was much more helpful  but do yourself a favor and don t purchase this monitor 
blacks out
i got this monitor around christmas time  at first it was working great  and i loved it  about a month later  it randomly shut off  and didn t turn back on until the next day  it is now august of 2017  and the monitor randomly shut off again  i thought  ok  this will be fine  it s happened before  and it will turn back on   it turned out it did not turn back on  and has been this way for two weeks  i don t know if this is common  but it happened to me  and it is just a warning to anyone who is considering buying this monitor  that it may shut off on you  and never work again  also  hp customer service is awful  and doesn t work half of the time 
good otherwise  but not worth high wobbliness
pretty good product overall and a solid price  but one key flaw makes it unusable for me   the wobbliness of the monitor  on a desk with even a very slight give  this thing is a nightmare  bouncing up and down maybe 1 4 to 1 2  with keystrokes  it is magnified because the monitor base is set back  and so it hangs out forward like a lever  causing major bounce  for something i m looking at   typing lines of text on for hours  that doesn t work  nauseating  etc   got the more expensive hp model and it also has a recessed base  which i think makes some sense to allow keyboard to get clsoe to monitor  but wobbless wayyyy less  almost note at all 
failed after 1 year   keep quiet and look pretty
   update    01mar2017 one of the two has failed after 13 months of service  i can no longer recommend this product  as i feel the useful life should be longer the one year  we have monitors from dell  acer  lenovo  hannspree and viewsonic in the office  this was the first hp monitor purchase and will be the last  as none of the other monitors have failed      update    i stare at a pair of these for 8 hours a day  5 days a week  they are fantastic monitors with a stylish design  no  you can t mount these beauties  but their sleek base is a work of art  ok  maybe that s a bit far reaching   they only have vga or hdmi video inputs  so make sure you have the appropriate cables  amazonbasics has a great quality dvi   hdmi cable which works in either direction  sorry folks  no sound coming out of these monitors  they do one thing and they do it well
