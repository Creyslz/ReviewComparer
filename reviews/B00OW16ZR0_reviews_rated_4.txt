easy use  cleaning and consistency
this is such a great product  and super easy for people to make their own smoothies and shakes  it s definitely worth the cost  i ve used mine about a hundred times already and each time it makes some delicious shakes and smoothies  i recommend making sure to add plenty milk  orange juice  coconut water or whatever other liquids you like in your drinks so that it ll be easier to blend all of your mixtures together  it has so many different speeds to choose from depending on the consistency that everyone likes  also  make sure you clean your blender right after use as it will be much easier than waiting because you ll have to try to scrub the bottom of the blender and get under the blades  it s super easy to use and always makes my liquids a nice consistency 
not the greatest  but it s good for the price 
the blade handles most things fairly well for my shakes  like frozen fruit  but isn t the strongest  there was a small rock in the blueberries i bought  and the blade got very dinged up after only a few seconds  it doesn t pulverize ice well  left large chunks  even when i blended it for a few minutes  cleans easily and it s nice that it s dishwasher safe 
which is exactly what i thought a very inexpensive blender would be like  i am satisfied for the money
its cheap but it works  which is exactly what i thought a very inexpensive blender would be like  i am satisfied for the money  it looks just like the picture 
it blended great but it leaked from the glass onto the black    
just used the blender for the first time  it blended great but it leaked from the glass onto the black part during blending  and then leaked as i was pouring smoothie into my cup  annoying mess    
on par for price 
a good blender for the price  it is very loud and does not give very consistent blending consistency of ice into a smoothly 
loud
worked for my use  made sounds like gears and rocks  need ear protection 
works well 
ive tried it with everything including frozen fruits and ice  10 10 for cheap and well functioning blender   bought it on sale 
good name brand
good name brand  when the package arrived  it was hard to tell what went where  we looked at the book but since we did not have all the pieces for it meaning not that there left behind more like what went where   what is it s purpose  we used it   got splatered  better explanation of speeds would be helpful  it works really well   we know now to use low speeds in the beginning  great packing   can count on the brand 
four stars
pretty content so far 
good value
takes some time to fully blend  need to shake it around a bit in between blends  overall great for the price 
works but it sounds like its going to die in less than a year
works but its been like 2 months and the motor is already starting to get loud as if its housing is loose  this should be 3 stars but i have a 2nd blender of the same brand and model that is like 4 years old  and works perfectly
four stars

the feature i like the best about this inexpensive blender is that it has a glass jar  which lasts much longer and sustains more cleaning in it s life than plastic does
