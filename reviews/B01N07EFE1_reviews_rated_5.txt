great small shelves for  20 bucks 
i just finished building and installing it on the wall  it took about an hour  a long hour  but it came out very nice  all i needed was a phillips screw driver  first off  some of the reviews are wrong  the screw color does not matter because included are colored plugs that fit over the screws and hid them  even the product photo is missing these plugs that hid the screws  maybe it s a product update or something but it works for me  second  people are saying these boards bend  they do not bend at all  i think they are trying to build it while attached to the wall  that is just dumb  you build it on a table or ground    then you attach it to the wall with 3 screws  note  these shelves will not hold considerable weight    it s only 3 screws holding it up after all  lastly  the shelves are very small  only about 7 5 inches tall each  each shelve length has a 7 inch radius    so not much  for a cheap  small  wall mounted corner shelves  this is the best deal  i m very happy with this purchase 
work great in my daughters room
i was really excited to come across these shelves for my daughter  i had bought some other shelves for my bathroom and my daughter was distraught because she thought they would be for her  i had promised the next shelving i bought to go in her room  i loved the idea of a corner shelving unit  i thought it would be unique and perfect for her to show off gymnastics trophies and such  i know shelves are shelves but honestly  these turned out fantastic for her  so  what is in the box  each shelf or piece was packaged securely in a box with padding for protection  i was impressed that the unit arrived in pristine condition  it included everything i needed including hardware and instructions  i will be honest that it looked challenging to put together but i had it done in about thirty minutes  the instructions were pretty clear  all of the panels are letter labeled making it really easy to install if you followed the directions  the only hiccup i had was figuring out that the three bigger screws went into three panels evenly spaced into the wall  it isnt rocket science so by looking at the diagrams i figured it out  they include anchors in case you are not installing on a stud and need added support  this installed quickly and looks really good  for simple shelving that doesnt break the piggy bank these are perfect  it even included little screw covers to match the shelves  i am super impressed and my daughter loves them 
had all the parts and was packed nicely  i was impressed with the look once it    
it came quickly  had all the parts and was packed nicely  i was impressed with the look once it was on installed  installation was easy but requires two people in order to accurately mark where it s going to be screwed into the wall  once i put it together it was kind of wobbly but once it was installed in the wall it was sturdier than i thought it would be  i should have paid more attention to the height of the shelves  as you definitely can t put a 5x7 frame on this but possibly a 4x6  that was my miss though  i would recommend this and buy it again 
so easy and great quality for the price 
i love it  so easy to install  under an hour and i m a woman  i got this for my bedroom because i have small items such as hair clip  glasses and even lotions  i m going to get another one for the other corner  i m happy today because of this  it s going to be a good day regardless 
this is really pretty once it s installed
this is really pretty once it s installed  the instructions that come with this unit are a bit confusing   it s just a diagram  no explanation  we realized that it didn t need to be put together  it just needed to be mounted on the wall piece by piece  once we figured that out  it was fairly easy to install  it sure make a ratty looking corner look so much nicer  for the price it was worth the initial install drama 
want a beautiful shelf to make any room stand out  look no further 
i recently started working from home and wanted to make my home office feel more homey  so i started to add photo frames and shelves for storing my items  i came across this shelf and it really caught my wifes eye  she told me to buy it right away  so that it would come in just in time as we were finished renovating the home office  the item arrived super fast   2 day guarantee  shipping  awesome  upon opening the item  i was impressed with how small of a box everything was packed in  we went ahead and opened the box to find the shelves neatly packed and nicely labeled by letter for ease of assembly  between the two of us we had the shelf put together and on the wall within 33 minutes  we timed it  and our power tools are our best friends  the build quality is amazing  nice and durable  included screws and couplings for securing the screws into the drywall  overall  i am pleased with the item and the outcome  i will be sure to update this review if any problems concerns arise  thank you for taking the time to read my review  irwin tools 4935639 black oxide hex shank drill bit  3 16 inch   used to drill the holes in the wall for the couplings hyperikon cordless power drill lithium 12v with driver set and project kit  3 8 keyless chuck   drill used stanley 68 012m all in one 6 way screwdriver   to manually screw the screw s provided
five stars
looks very nice  and easy to assemble 
perfect for displaying  exactly what a weeb like me wanted
i absolutely love it  it s exactly what i wanted  even if my wall in the apartment is slanted it still fit perfectly  i m currently using it as my shelf for games  but i m planning on buying another to display manga  the price was very reasonable too  i had no complaints  my favorite part about it is the finish and durability  i know i dropped a piece myself on accident and no scratches  it arrived on time and in perfect condition  10 10 would buy again  but like when i move out because i have no room left in my room  ironic 
i love it 
just starting to redocrate and i get compliments on this shelf all the time  i love it 
perfect fit  size  and color for a home office half bath
having just remodeled my home office bathroom which included getting rid of one of those tall plastic double door cheap storage cabinets  i opted for a southwest color scheme of cabinets  a mojave sand wall color  mojave corian counter tops and a dark distressed looking barnwood flooring  with the cabinet gone  that whole corner exploded with emptiness  i saw this corner piece here on amazon and took a flyer on it as being the one   it was  fairly easy to put together however pay close attention to alpha id system  it looks inutitive but then it becomes a rubix cube if you mess up one piece connection  i get a lot of compliments from guests abut the bathroom  not bad decorating for a guy  dontcha think 
good shelves  but modifications needed to make symmetric 
with slight modification you can get two shelves to be symmetric  otherwise they ll look like the one on the left 
   read review    would recommend to anyone  great shelving 
awesome design and shelving idea  easy installation  recommended tools  pencil pen  impact drill drill driver  hammer  phillips bit for drill  and 3 16  drill bit   very sturdy and clean look  i will say i wish they had a bigger size  shelving is rather shallow  i couldn t use it for my original idea to put my wedding frames  pictures and memorabilia on for my wife because the shelves weren t deep enough or tall enough between the shelves to hold the 57 potrait frames with the stands  but  we reporposed it and used it for a nic nac shelf in our eat in area off our kitchen  very good product  will hold the weight of anything you could fit on it and then some  after installation i grabbed the top board that is mounted flush to the wall and hung on it  175lbs   hopefully this will help you with your decision on purchase 
beautiful design
arrived on time  the wall mount looks beautiful in the living room shelf space  the distance between each shelf is small so you can only keep smaller display items  which is okay as i needed something similar  the screws are covered with caps which makes the display even better without any screws popping up in the view  i used sugru to bond the top and the bottom shelf to the wall instead of using screws or nails as it helps in keeping the esthetics of the wall as is 
five plus stars 
five plus stars  absolutely loved this shelf  it took a while to figure out which plate goes where as the instructions and markings on the shelf itself werent great but then i could live with it as it gave me this awesome look to my living room  i have quite somethings on it as you see and its very sturdy 
nice  put together before mounting   
i really like these shelves  they don t hold a lot but the design is great and it holds just enough of my things such as a jewelry box  a blue tooth speaker and a couple of other knick knacks  like other reviewers have said  put it together before you mount it or you will have hell trying to put it together on the wall  i would buy another one easily 
great for my daughter s knick knacks 
this was great for my daughter s room  she wanted a place to put her tiny gems  knick knacks  blind bag treasures  etc  i didn t want anything to take up space in her room so this was a perfect use of wasted space  off in a corner  but high enough that she could still have a doll house or something beneath it  she loves changing her stuff on the shelves and making them different 
nice wall mou t
nice wall mount for the money  when putting it together  i recommend doing it on it s side because it starts to get a little flimsy the more you add on layers  oh make sure you pay attention to holes in middle for wall mounting so you don t have to undo it all  looks nice and great price  arrived on time 
it s a great addition to our livingroom
a total pain in the butt to put together  but if you pay close attention to each piece it won t be that difficult  that is no fault of the instructions  it was me being impatient to get it on the wall  otherwise haven t had any issues with it  it s a great addition to our livingroom 
everyone is complaining about the size   
   but it clearly states the sizing if you read through the description and through q as  yes  the drywall anchors are rubbish  but nothing a trip into my garage  or a hardware store  couldn t fix if you re going into drywall  as i did   overall  i think it s a very decent shelving unit for the price  i purchased two  white for the bathroom and walnut for an odd corner in the hallway  i also purchased some cheap acrylic paint at the local craft store to cover the screw heads  with amazing results  versus the screw caps provided in the kit  
best corner space
we had mounted these shelves in the left corner of the foryer and it is perfect for grad and go items we keep forgetting  also  vintage breakables are displayed in top shelves where grandkids cannot reach  my daughter liked these so much that i purchased one for her and she uses it in her bathroom to store her essential oils   up high away from toddlers 
corner shelves   me likey
these shelves hold things and they go on your corner which is spaciously convent  and people stare at them  what more could you want  i should also add that i have no skill at all with setting things up and i was able to set this up  it comes with holes in the wood already so you just need a screwdriver and you put it together beforehand and then you only need to drill three holes into your wall with a drill  so that was nice 
five stars
fits perfect in corner  worked out great for minecraft idea  easy assembly 
love  
i needed something in the corner of my bedroom so i saw this and fell in love  i had my husband assemble it  which he said was tedious and annoying  strange coming from someone who decided burnt turd was a good name for our shared amazon account   it didnt seem very difficult    all in all im im happy with the size  so happy i found something to fit that empty space  and for such a reasonable price too 
very happy with it nice quality and very easy to instal    
i got mine on sale   very happy with it nice quality and very easy to instal one word 5 star    
happy with this purchase 
it looks good with my light gray wall and serves its purpose  it was pretty easy to put together and install even though the anchors it came with weren t great  it wasn t a big deal to me especially for its price  highly recommended 
perfect 
this shelf was so easy to hang up and put together  you may need two people  because im short and almost needed help but i managed  love the color  its pretty true to the advertisement  and the wood seems pretty sturdy  i would buy it again  and i would definitely recommend this shelf  its cute  fun  and gives the wall something more to look at then just a normal shelf 
perfect   
i have a mermaid nautical inspired room and these shelves added so much for me  very easy to build and anchor into the wall  3 screws   as you can see  it holds quite a bit  hope this helps  i adore the shelves 
exaclty as in picture  looks great 
very easy to install and it looks great  i have traveled quite a bit lately and got this to display the souvenirs  it worked out perfectly  it is exactly as shown in the picture 
adorable
perfect shelves with a little bit of personality  i didn t realize there were two different size screws and accidentally put the long ones in the shelves instead of in the wall  but we had more of the big screws in the garage so it wasn t a big deal 
highly recommended 
im not they can print things together but this was very easy  the directions were so easy  after putting it together its still looked like a nice shelf  adds a lot to my home and im glad i purchased  i love when i have great amazon purchases  
very modern and sleek looking
this corner wall mount shelf is great  it looks wonderful mounted to the wall  we have a small house and not much room to put pictures of the grandkids when we get them  mounting this in the corner allowed me to be able to display those great pictures  there are 5 shelves and  though each shelf isn t real big  they are big enough to place a 5 x 7 framed picture on each shelf  very modern and clean looking  would definitely buy another one if i needed it 
nice shelving on my wall
looks beautiful on my bedroom wall  putting it together had me frustrated at first  especially putting the lower shelves on  i ended up putting it together in units  one back piece  one shelf  them assembled it from there  much easier  but well worth any frustrations  i looks great 
cute and perfect for small corner
i needed some shelves in my nursery to be  i have 2 small corners near 2 closets and this is a perfect fit  i m actually about to order a second for the other closet corner  ignore the paint  it s a work in progress and my husband doesn t want to cut in around it in a few weeks 
just follow the instrutions   you ll be fine 
it arrive 4 days after i bought it  all of the pieces and instructions where there but they where dusty and one shelf piece was a little cracked    but it was pretty easy to build   i am 5 1 and not handy at all but i built it alone and in under 30 minutes   
works 
this is a pretty good solution to a small spot that needs some storage space  we are using it in our half bath  and it works great to hold our son s stuff in there  the instructions could have been a bit better  but i figured it out 
nice little corner shelf 
i am so pleased with this purchase  all pieces came shipped in a small box with directions inside  directions are pictures  but easy to follow since all pieces are labeled with letters  it took about 20 minutes to assemble  just screwing pieces together  and about 5 minutes to hang  i did this by myself  easy  so only one person is needed  check the measurements because it is not very wide   i measured my wall space before purchasing and it fit perfectly  screw covers were included with my shelf  all pieces arrived in good condition  very happy and would purchase again 
these tiered wall mount work wonderfully on our small bedroom and they are very trendy    
these tiered wall mount work wonderfully on our small bedroom and they are very trendy and look great  dont expect to put too much on them  the shelf is decorative mainly  small knick knacks work great 
great wedding gift for a decorator 
i got this as a wedding gift for my sister and brother in law and they love it  my sister loves to decorate so she has stuck all sorts of fun things on it it looks amazing  it was easy to put up and although they said they can t stick anything heavy on it  they love it 
cheap but awesome 
i have 6 of these  they work well enough to display my huge and heavy agates  i really like how they look  its hard to find good corner shelving solutions  and this is perfect  also  if youre willing to put in a little more custom work  you can assemble them to mirror eachother on the same wall  if you dont  the pattern they make wont match  as in  the solid panels will be on opposite walls  not sure how else to explain it 
five stars
nice little shelf  cant fit anything too tall on it but looks nice for trophys and books
