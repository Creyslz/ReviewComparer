don t waste your time   
absolute garbage   i should have listened to my gut  i usually don t leave reviews but want to save people the hassle i had  instructions   piss poor  mounting hardwear   piss poor  quality of the product   piss poor  shelves arrived with no padding between the 3   they are all just nested together in a box so two of them were scratched  as others have said   the mounting harware is complete crap so i bought my own better anchors  then after measuring and drilling and attempting to mount  the slot where the screw slides down to lock it in place blew out on one side because they re made of press board garbage  i guess you get what you pay for     i wouldn t waste my time if i was you  these are going back asap  right after i fill and paint the holes i had to drill in my wall to place them     
half baked instructions  missing screw and terrible screw anchors
this product deserves 0 starts  the instructions dont tell you what drill size to use  so you have to guess    is it 7 32 or 13 64  well  if you try 7 32 drill you will not be able to put the screw anchors in  they will just bend and break  if you use 13 64 the screw anchors will just fall through the dry wall or come out  i expect these shelves to fall off the wall within a month  do not buy 
i can t keep anything on these shelves except for useless tiny nick knacks
these are extremely narrow  i thought that 3 inches was something at least  but it s nothing   i can t keep anything on these shelves except for useless tiny nick knacks  however if that s your thing  go for it 
screw heads all broke off 
the screw heads all broke off and now i have jagged metal stuck in my walls  dangerous  so someone has to come fix this now  i m pissed  do not use any hardware that comes with these  it s total garbage 
bought this based on all of the good reviews  and was really excited about them especially    
bought this based on all of the good reviews  and was really excited about them especially the price  however  impossible to hang on walls  actually created huge holes in the wall  had to return  spend the extra money and get the wood ones 
poor quality  not worth the   
these shelves are very poor quality  i hung them in our bathroom to help keep our counters clear  we only used them for light bottles and hygiene care such as lotions  glasses  contact solution  deodorant etc  after only a week  the shelves tore through the screws and fell from the wall  each time we attempted to re hang them  they tore worse  i do not recommend these shelves 
this was a horrible experience  the dry wall anchors did not work    
this was a horrible experience  the dry wall anchors did not work at all  3 of the 6 included anchors just bent while following the limited instructions  now i have to go out and buy additional anchors just to finish the job
