one star to 4 stars
broke while being assembled  i first wrote a review for this product and storageaid giving one star  i did have difficulty with the installation    and one part  wood holding the mirror  was pierced by the screw  i gave up and just returned  i am changing this to a 4 star  as the closemate cs reached out to me trying to make good on this product in several ways  because of this reaching out  i have changed my rating 
great additon to the bedroom
wood pieces had several nicks when they arrived  the hanger does not have contoured edges  insert card advertises a free name plate  but has no contact information to order it  couldn t find it online either  unless i get amnesia  i won t need it  easy to assemble and quite functional  much better than throwing your clothes on a chair or the floor and cluttering your nightstand when you empty your pockets 
nice  elegant furniture piece
nice  elegant furniture piece  pretty sturdy and well designed  was a bit hard to assemble the iron pieces which needed to be pressed together strongly but very carefully in order foor it to fit into the holes made for it  that s the only reason i have it 4 stars but after its done it might hold up stronger because it was harder to get inti it s place  you need to concentrate very well while pushing it into place so that the wood color shouldn t chip  which happened by me 
seems to be a great protector  hard install though 
4 star instead of 5 because the install is extremely hard and time consuming  the protector looked cheap at first and i was pretty skeptical  i carefully read the instructions and decided to apply the first one  i cleaned the screen and then did the dust tape  applied the protector  and there was one small particle of dust on the bottom left and the entire screen protector wouldn t stay down  barely pealed it up  used a toothpick to get it out  put it back down  but the protector had bubbles everywhere and would not apply  so   went to protector two  re did dust tape  applied protector  starting at the top  more stuff to align  and worked down  took a couple tried but got it and all the bubbles worked out  pealed off the protector layer  and what you know  looks beautiful  it looks really good actually  i am not sure how durable it is  to soon to tell  i would really suggest making it a wet application protector  those are a lot easier to apply  specially since the galaxy s5 is water proof it is really not a big deal pro  beautiful screen protector  does not take away from screen  seems durable  comes with 3 protectors  cheap  good customer service  you don t see smears    cons  way to hard to put on  extremely prone to dust particles overall  if you have patience  i would try it out  i think it is going to work well 
easy to assemble
packaged well but still arrived damaged  easy to assemble  overly expensive for the quality of material  thin fake wood over particle board  should be expected from product originating in china  i wouldn t buy again nor recommend  edit  customer service was quick to respond to this post and replaced the chipped piece  i received the replacement with a very small nick in an unassuming location  increasing the rating due to customer service 
great  lasts a while 
lasted me almost a year before it finally gave out  i won t be buying another because i want to try bigger umbrella s but this is a good one for the price  it s defintely breakable though  it broke in the wind yesterday 
four stars
i recieved this with some minor damage and the problem was resolved quickly to my satisfaction 
ok but somewhat flimsy
bought this for myself  the only downside is the coat hanger at the top is loose after 2 months of usage 
four stars
very functional  but also belts when wind comes
