four stars
serves it purpose as an rta corner shelf
awesome
the shelves were very easy to assemble  i highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a little splash of decoration in their home  please note  each shelf is about 8 inches 
looks great in my son s room
looks great in my son s room  my one annoyance is that i wish they included white caps to place over the screw holes  otherwise  it is very pretty and sturdy 
hard to complain for the price 
it s hard to complain too much for the price  it s veneer on mdf board  the boards themselves are not horrible but the hardware is  so do yourself a favor and toss it  there s a couple problems  but overall it s fine for nicknacks  first the holes for the screws are drilled as deep as the screws so it s very easy to strip them before they get tight  this is easy to fix if you use new screws that are another 1 4 1 2  longer so they have more bite  since it s a veneer using wood glue to attempt to make it more secure doesn t work as the glue doesn t stick to the veneer  also make sure you pay attention to the square pieces only one side has a veneer on it  so you want to make sure that s the side showing when assembling  the mounting hardware is pretty cheap  best to use some better in wall fasteners unless you get lucky in your corner and hit a stud on both sides  the other thing i would say is it s not tiny  but it s not nearly as big as the product photo would have you believe  anything larger than about 6  in any dimension is probably not going to fit  i d put this in the category of disposable functional furniture  it s very cheap  it looks pretty nice  and will probably last for years as long as you don t put anything really heavy on it or abuse it  however  i wouldn t expect it to survive a move or any abuse unless you disassembled it  and even then the mdf might not hold screws the second assembly  it s a nice piece for the  24  if it was  50 i d say it was way overpriced 
cool idea
we are not the most handy people so it took us a bit to assemble the self and then hang it  the only instructions that you receive are on the side of the box so that didn t help much  the screws that are included are a shinny brass that really stand out on the dark wood  so i took a black marker and colored them in they look much better now  overall very happy with this item and quick delivery 
art deco on the cheap
2 stars for the cheap build quality  complete with screw holes that easily strip out  3 stars for the somewhat cheesy finish  i think walnut version of these shelves match the interior of an old cheap trailer house exactly  5 stars for the better than average assembly instructions  especially in this day and age  5 stars for the stylish yet simplistic art deco design  i want to live in 70 s era california instead 
these shelves are perfect solution both on behalf of design and space
as i don t have enough space in my bedroom for night table  these shelves are perfect solution both on behalf of design and space  it was so easy to install them  everything you need is included in the package  you will only need drill and level  i specially loved design  white color suits everything and perfect addition to any style  if need something nice  useful  easy to install and stylish  these are your shelves 
not 100  90 s
the one i received  the corners are not 100  90 s  it only comes with 3 support screws  i set this up for my wife and knowing she will load it up with all kinds of items  so i added 3 bigger support screws and anchors  they are not hidden like the ones that come with it  but i know it won t fall  and i know she can put anything on there that will fit now  my wife loves it  would give it five if it meshed in the coners better 
nice look  not good for things that would need to be plugged in
easy to put together  took me less than 15 minutes  though i did use a power drill  i imagine it d take twice that time hand screwing 23 screws  looks nice  shelves do not have much space in between as other reviewers have said but it s great for some small stuffed animals and a few other nicknacks unfortunately  it s really useless for anything that needs to be plugged in  i intended to put the baby monitor on the shelving but there is no where for the cord to go 
overall a good quality product for the price
overall a good quality product for the price  the directions were not as clear as i would ve liked them to be but thankfully i have a handy fianc  one of the pieces were supposed to have holes drilled in both sides but only had holes on the one side  again  my handy fianc was able to rectify that situation and we were able to put it together and hang it in about 30 minutes  the wood doesn t split like it does on some of the cheaper stuff which was nice since we had to modify one of the pieces  it s extremely sturdy once mounted 
takes time but is worth the buy
the product comes with the individual shelf pieces  the screws and plastic anchors  i recommend buying your own anchors  or toggle bolts  because the ones given are pretty cheap and didnt expand well enough in the wall to support the shelves  you have to screw each shelf into the other  and to do so you need a small phillips screwdriver  i recommend a small one because its harder to do so with a larger one as it wont fit between the shelves  when all put together and hung  it looks great 
decent corner shelves for the price
hey are good enough for the price  these are particle boards  so not super strong  good to put some toys and a few kids books  nothing too heavy  the color is more towards the darker brown   almost black  although curved  the flat edges are sharp  i will have to put some soft baby proofing once my kid starts crawling   walking  the wall screws and drywall plugs are a joke  dont recommend using them  i could just pull out the entire shelf  i got better ones from a local hardware thats rated for 50lb capacity each  this thing isnt moving anywhere now 
love these shelves
love these shelves  a little bit of a pain to put together  i ha to use my own anchors in the wall  the ones that came with it weren t that great  likewise  make sure to use a level to make sure your walls are perfectly even  my walls have plaster on them and are slightly uneven so the top of this comes off the corner a few mm  in no way am i deducting points for my walls 
pretty detailed  but you still need to use some    
product was as expected except for a few things  the reviews i read complained about the instructions and the exposed screw heads  the manufacturer obviously listened because it now has instructions inside the box  rather than just on the box  pretty detailed  but you still need to use some common sense  they also include plastic caps to cover the screw heads  does a nice job  color and size was as expected  the wall mollys included are garbage  use some of your own  its worth the trouble 
great idea  needs a little better screw slots
great idea  needs a little better screw slots  putting this together was easy but there was one piece that the screws seemed to slide in too easy and in turn made the shelf not very secure wobbly   i used a third screw to make it more secure  it works for what i need
nice shelves
these shelves were relatively easy to put together once i got the hang of it  there were some snags when i made it about half way as my drill could not get in at the right angle  i found that putting the shelves together in 3 parts and then connecting the parts together made for a better situation  the package came with everything that i needed and it took me about a half hour to make the entire shelf and mount it 
has a zig zag look and although the shelves are small they  being 5  held all my perfume bottle just wonderful  ver nice i like it
although it was packed in a box and then bubble wrap the corner of one shelve was damaged but with a little glue and placing it on the top did not affect the look  has a zig zag look and although the shelves are small they  being 5  held all my perfume bottle just wonderful  ver nice i like it 
perfect for kids room 
i love this shelf  one tier had a portion peeled off but my decorations covered that  the only difficult part was placing in the corner  one wall i hit concrete  had to get special drill bit  concrete nail and anchors  that meant a trip to the store  the other wall  i used a sturdier drywall anchor with 1 nail it came with  i place it in my daughters room and placed some of her beanie boos for display  now stuck finding another way to display the rest of her collection  i managed to fit 20 beanies on the shelf 
nice  sturdy shelf
i purchased one for a living room  i liked it so much that i bought another for my son s room and had decided to buy one more to round out the crib wall  packaged well  shipped in excellent condition  the screws that come with it are okay  but my husband used his own on the second shelf  i can fit 5x7 sized frames on the shelves very nicely  and though i have not hung anything with any weight to it  i would feel confident putting heavy objects on it  if you can screw it into the corner studs  this is an excellent shelf  especially for the price point  i made it four stars due to the hardware  and the pieces do not match perfectly but enough that once it is hung is unnoticeable  i wouldn t purchase this for books 
i like it  it s different 
i really like this shelf  its different  easy to assemble if you follow the directions  most of the reviews said you need 2 people to install it  i did it by myself and i hate putting stuff together  lol  all in all  i am very well pleased with my shelf 
for the price this shelf is nice  we are using it in our little girls    
the instructions were very hard to follow as they are limited with the information they tell you  you will want a short screw driver  there is not a lot of room in between shelves for a long screw driver  my shelf had black hand and finger prints all over it but i managed to wipe them off  for the price this shelf is nice  we are using it in our little girls nursery to put keepsakes on  it took me about 20 minutes to assemble all by myself   
we live in an older house so this could be    
we live in an older house so this could be why but   some parts weren t completely flush with the walls  and  it didn t hold as much as i expected  i was hoping to use this for some of my books   still really handy  and i have two of them 
not the best quality but it s worth the  20
not the best quality but it s worth the  20  there was one little chip in one of the pieces but it s not noticeable because of where it is  very easy to put together  i wouldn t trust putting anything too heavy on it  i m using it for dcor in my daughter s nursery and it s perfect  very cute  would recommend 
decent for  20
works pretty darn well   i just wish it was made of actual wood instead of particle board   tis my only complaint  ill probably replace it in the future with an actual wood corner shelf made from someone off etsy eventually  but for now this works 
definitely glad i bought this shelf
definitely glad i bought this shelf  very easy to assemble  just make sure your wall screws are aligned with a pencil mark you will have to hold it and maneuver to get it right probably easier with two people but definitely still some what easy by yourself  nice and appears to be a float shelf  love it  4 stars due to it made me work up a sweat lol
a nice addition to the room
the shelves came well packaged with very easy instructions  however i wasn t impressed with the anchors that came with the shelving  i decided to purchase a more heavier duty anchor and install the shelves with these 
only looks good from afar  but it s solid
the quality on the finish isn t the best  but it is a great display if you put it in a corner where you can t see it from up close  the wood like material holds up rather well and setup  aka  putting it together and on the wall  was a breeze
