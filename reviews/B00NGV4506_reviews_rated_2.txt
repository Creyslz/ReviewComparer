i m disappointed because because we cant seem to ave the option    
my mom had got one of these blenders and it had gotten four symmetrical cracks in all four bottom of the plastic container causing it to leak  thinking we stored it wrong causing the cracks we bought another  not more than the two weeks we had the new one simply crushing ice had put the same identical four cracks in the new blender  i m disappointed because because we cant seem to ave the option to return either blenders  which are now useless  its a shame because the blenders worked great other than the cracking feature  file    c  users jacob downloads img 0742 jpg
nice blender but     
i ve been using this blender for 5 months and worked great  super powerful blender with nice design  but  the plastic jar since to be made of a poor quality plastic because it cracked while blending  i use the blender around 4 to 5 times a week  i only blend fruits and i don t even use ice  i ve been trying to contact the seller but not answer  phone just keep ringing  i m very disappointed for what it could have been a great machine 
poor quality 
updating my review 1 5 years after purchase  i loved my blender  but it literally broke into pieces after only a year and change  a few months after i got it  a crack started to form and eventually just broke wide open  keep in mind  i only used this to make smoothies  it wasn t heavily used or anything  i m so disappointed  my thrift store blender lasted longer than this  i expect much more for this price 
pitcher cracks too easily
the blender is fine  but the pitcher keeps cracking  almost immediately  i had a replacement pitcher sent after a month of use  and the first time i use the replacement there was a crack forming  it took a few weeks or so for the corner to completely break off  and more cracks are forming around the base still  i reached out to ninja and i would have to pay  64 for a 2nd replacement  which seems crazy since this is clearly a defect  i m only using this to make smoothies with frozen blueberries and bananas mostly  so there should be no reason that this keeps happening 
disappointing  not worth the cost 
was really looking forward to getting this blender as i heard so many people rave about their ninja blenders and i wanted a nice one to make fruit smoothies with on a regular basis  i was pretty disappointed with this one  pros    blades easily remove to make pouring and cleaning easy   nice pour spout on lid  don t have to remove lid to pour    chops ice well cons    because the blades are in the middle  i find that some food items i put in just get pushed out to the sides and stick there instead of getting blended in no matter how long i let it blend  i have to open up and scrape the food off the sides to ensure that it all gets mixed together and there are no chunks  even when i add more liquid in the mixture  this continues to be an issue    does not chop up things like pomegranate seeds  included in one of the frozen berry mixes i buy from costco  no matter how long i blend it  i end up chewing on whole seeds every time so i have started buying a different berry mixture so i don t have to worry about seeds but i shouldn t have to do that  i wish i could return this and use the money towards a higher quality blender 
because i hate this blender so much
this is the first time my three young children are all napping in the afternoon  of all the  many many  things i could be doing right now  i chose to write this review  because i hate this blender so much  let s count the ways  shall we  1  the blade and blade holder is huge and does not allow larger chunks of fruit or vegetables to be placed inside the container  2  the blades are all placed on the side  and none in the center bottom of the blade holder  meaning there is no centrifugal force  meaning that the blades scatter the components of your smoothie all over the container  instead of towards the center bottom of the container  this means that you cannot open the lid to add more liquid or fruit as it is blending  3  the blades are not locked into place and fall out when you pour 4  it is unnecessarily loud  heavy  and clunky  5  it does not blend properly  it is about as effective as a mortar and pestle  so in the spirit of fairness  i gave this thing two stars as it does sort of blend things and if you want to use it to make fruit smoothies  i suppose it does the job  however  if you want to make any creamy soups  vegetable smoothies  or sauces you are better off with a regular  30 oster  my cheap blender does a more thorough job and gets less dirty  i finally thought i was rid of this nightmare when it  after only a year  with maybe bi weekly use  it crapped out on me  the manufacturer offered to send me a new motor  but i was to pay the  30 shipping  thanks but no thanks  verdict  not even as good as a cheap blender  does kind of blend 
customer service is laughable
pros  easy to use  cleans easy in dishwasher  blends thoroughly  safe locking starting mechanism cons  ninja customer service is a joke if something fails  weak pitcher latch on ours broke 45 days after purchase   was told a replacement pitcher was  65  warranty was only valid if purchased directly from them and only covered the motor base  lid and pitcher are not  no 60 day guarantee or years warranty 
doesn t put the  smooth  in  smoothie 
if you re interested in making green smoothies like i am  you might want to look elsewhere  even on the highest setting  my smoothie  kale  banana  apple  and 2  milk  is chunky and chewy  see picture   seeing a video review comparing this blender to the kitchenaid 5 speed diamond blender has convinced me that if i want to put the  smooth  in  smoothie   i need to get the latter  which is ostensibly quieter and blends veggies very well  will be returning this one tomorrow 
cracked and leaking after less than a month s use
i was very happy with this blender when i first tried it  i have always had 20 dollar blenders so this was a step up because it is much more powerful  i make smoothies and blend cauliflower for mash sometimes  but the primary reason for purchase was to make bulletproof coffee every morning  upon first use for bp coffee it produced froth like i have never had and it was truly delicious  the reason i landed on this blender is because after doing research for the best blender specifically for bp coffee this was recommended if you are not willing to splurge for a vitamix or blendtec  at this point  i may have to do that  because even this blender has already cracked and is leaking after less than a month s use  luckily i am still in the return frame for amazon so they are sending me a new one  i also purchased warranty   upon doing more research  people say in order to keep blenders from cracking when making bp coffee  you must release the air pressure out of the blender by taking off the top after no more than blending for 10 seconds  then you can put the top back on and blend for additional time if needed  i am going to try this method  and hopefully it will keep it from cracking
