portable but not windproof
if you need a light umbrella that will easily fit in a bag or a coat pocket  this is great  however  this is not windproof and will invert as soon as a good wind comes along  i havent had an umbrella invert on me in 20 yrs until i used this one  granted  i thought it was funny but i thought we were past that with our umbrella technology  edit update  after writing this review  the seller company contacted me and they offered me a refund or a better umbrella  since i wasn t completely dissatisfied with the product  i chose the replacement umbrella   the replacement is the size of a typical compact umbrella   i appreciate that they were willing to satisfy me and make it up to me 
i love how small this is
i love how small this is  it s perfect for taking on vacation  somewhere it might rain and i want to be prepared just in case  it s a personal size umbrella  so plan accordingly  but  it s lightweight and super small  which is nice  it ll stow nicely in a purse  backpack  center console of the car  etc  i don t expect to use this much  which is good because i m not convinced it s super durable  it s lightweight  but that also means the material isn t as sturdy as other umbrellas 
good for light rain  not much else
love the design  does what it says in terms of providing rain and sun coverage and is good in a pinch  the metal construction doesn t feel strong or durable  it s very shaky in the wind and has already turned inside out on me once and i ve only owned it for maybe 2 weeks  i have to hold it in multiple places to make sure it won t fly away flip inside out  it rattles in the wind and i don t think it ll hold up well in strong rain or wind  folds up compactly but not neatly  and the stitching on the velcro strap that wraps around is poor  uneven  and i m worried it ll rip off  it s not a bad buy  especially if you re just throwing in a bag as an emergency back up umbrella  i m just unsure if i ll buy another when it inevitably breaks 
great form factor  sketchy execution 
the overall size and materials of this umbrella are good  either the design or the construction leave something to be desired  i ve been using it for several weeks and the first and second telescoping segments above the handle no longer stay extended  so  i must keep my finger on the stem of the umbrella to keep those parts from retracting  the umbrella itself stays open fine and the higher telescoping parts work  just the first segment keeps collapsing  good to keep around for an emergency but i will likely revert to a bigger umbrella with a more reliable build 
no design on outside 
umbrella came without a cover  design is only on the inside of the umbrella so the outside top is boring black  which is what i was trying to avoid by getting a design  it doesn t seem to want to stay open and locked until you get it just right  the piece that wraps around and then hooks to hold umbrella together is actually very easy and nice and i like it better than any other i ve ever had  just wish the umbrella was better and had the design on the outside  it is light and very small so it will be good for traveling 
broke on third use  excellent customer service to replace 
cute pattern but the umbrella is not made well  broke on it s third use  the top popped out if the pole  it wasn t windy  i was just walking along and it broke  general cons  the handle is very small so it can be a little uncomfortable to hold  wrapping the umbrella back up can be difficult with only the rubber straps  and as it s not a mechanical umbrella  it can be a little annoying to open and close quickly  pros  it s an umbrella  regular sized  and does it s job  edit  excellent customer service  i immediately got an email addressing the issue with the umbrella and an offer for either a full reimbursement or a free replacement  i opted to go with the replacement  and reordered today 
almost ok
nice looking umbrella  it s a manual open and close  it s harden to fasten it open the clasp is hard to fasten open  sad  it is a nice light weight no sun umbrella  just hard to clasp it open  update  the seller reached out to me and replaced this umbrella for free  customer service was wonderful    for that i increased my rating from 2 to 3 
just ok 
i like that it s compact enough to put in a purse  but it was a little hard to open manually and make it click open  when i closed it  then i had to fiddle around getting it just so so  to get it to fit back into the little pouch that came with it  with all the great reviews  i thought i would like it more 
like the lined version better sturdier
the lined version we bought seemed a bit sturdier than the unlined sale version my husband bought  same order  same amazon page   they were both flimsy and wouldnt hold up to a proper storm  but for piping in a backpack and hauling around all day on vacation it was sufficient 
if your looking to a super compact umbrella then this fits the bill
if your looking to a super compact umbrella then this fits the bill  however  because of its compact nature the pole doesnt extend very far making it super uncomfortable to hold to get it high enough above your head  my hand had to be raised to almost ear level to get it high enough over me  also  the handle on the bottom of the pole easily spins off the pole  i didnt think it was a big deal  but then found it was somewhat annoying when id be holding it and all the sudden the umbrella was twisting out 
three stars
product is engineered with effort  but made with light duty materials
