really disappointed   
got this to make smoothies and after adding the fruit and liquid i turned on the blender and it made noise but didn t really blend anything  i added more liquid and moved everything around with a spoon and turned it back on but it still only cut through what was on the bottom  i think it was peaches  but nothing else really happened  i finally added even more liquid and still it didn t blend the fruit  i wish when i bought this that i had tried it sooner so i could have sent it back but i was in the middle of moving and just got to try it recently  it has been sitting in my cabinet unused since then and we already got a different blender to use instead  i know hamilton beach makes great products but this one just isn t one of them 
do not use dangerous if making more than one
the cups are awesome but pointless since motor burned out a month after having it and we only used it for making smoothies which we love but only had maybe three times and there s 4 of us so the two to go cup and the pitcher   2 servings  perfect for my family except that it burned out when making the last smoothie  i had to grab it by the cord and chucked it outside in the snowbank cause it was smoking so bad i was worried it would actually burst into flames  luckily no one got hurt except my pride since now i m the mother who can burn smoothies  probably fine if only making one but what if it would have done this to one of the kids they might not have acted quick enough could have started house on fire
poorly made
i just got my blender this week went to open and use it for the first time  and there was black stuff coming out of the bottom  the bottom is poorly made it came apart the first time i used it and got my counter top super dirty  i included a picture 
terrible blender
i ve used this about 5 times  i was making herbalife  which is just powder  smoothies with it  it first started to smoke after the 2nd use  i  d turn off the blender  rearrange the device  stir it   try again  i thought if it could crush ice  like advertised   it could blend frozen fruit  along with regular fruit with no problem  it s overheated so badly  that it just stopped working  i ve had it no longer than a few month  very disappointed in this product   going to be looking for a new model   brand for my next purchase  wouldn t advise wasting your money on it 
cheaply made and broke after 7 weeks of use  do not recommend   
a friend and i ordered these right after christmas to mix up our protein shakes and one already broke  was smoking last night  i noticed when i use mine  it also smells hot  we are only mixing a cup of crushed ice and plenty of liquids so not putting a lot of stress on the machine  the window has closed for return so very disappointed  i do not recommend this product  i guess you get what you pay for 
as cheap as you d expect   
the blender struggles to blend the simplest items  even a yogurt based drink takes multiple minutes and leaves your kitchen smelling like burnt rubber  every time i want to use the blender  i have to shake the whole thing as i blend and must continually tighten the base  because the vibrations will loosen the fit and cause a major mess   the motor is also very loud  i m a college student and require thrifty purchases  but this is a waste of money  do yourself a favor and spend the extra  30 
one star
this thing came broken and started sounding weird  smoke was coming out update  order a different one and got cancel by amazon  because there was none left  i order a new one of this thinking maybe the first one was defective   wronggg    this thing is loud  makes noises that im afraid its going to break  i did a banana a frozen strawberries smoothie and i felt like i put rocks inside that were destroying it  smell like its burning  start shaking strangely  im not giving this another chance  im returning it asap and don t even look back 
wouldn t recommend or purchase again 
i bought this to make smoothies  and the first two came out great  but when attempting to make the third  consecutive days  not all on one day   the motor started smoking and almost started a fire in my kitchen  i did not overload it or use anything different in the smoothies  it was such a huge disappointment and waste of money 
not worth you    bucks   invest in something more powerful and something that lasts
worked well to start with but it lasted for 3 months only  over it  looks like the company  hamilton beach  will take some time to respond to my complaint as it has been a couple of days now  the product had a warranty of 3 years but the company s ignorance after just 3 months is kinda turning me off                  reducing rating to 1 star as all efforts to reach customer support have been in vain for last 4 days  thank god that we have amazon backing it for us   
leaks from the bottom after 2 months
initially really liked this blender because it was easy to make my smoothie in the to go cup and head out the door  however  after using daily for two months  it has started leaking from the bottom  doesn t matter whether i use the cup or the larger assembly    i thought i might not be tightening it enough so i was extra careful to make sure the seal was tight but the same thing happens when my husband uses it 
disappointed
this product worked great for all of 3 days  i received my package on friday  march 3rd  in the afternoon  on saturday morning i made a berry smoothie and it worked great  the same happened for monday and tuesday  on wednesday morning while making my peach and mango smoothie  the motor started smoking and the smell of burning plastic permeated my house  i am extremely disappointed as i have had several hamilton beach products and they all worked just fine  unfortunately i would not purchase this product again 
it didn t blend well for me   
i m doing the green smoothie cleanse and the ingredients needed to make several of the smoothies would not all blend in the blender  due to being to small  i had to blend the ingredients in 2 parts and then mix together  due to some ingredients not being broken down  processed i e   frozen strawberries and bananas  the cups  smoothie containers were efficient  however if a lid or cover for the opening would be better for travel  had to purchase a different smoothie  blender due to the longer process in the morning of having to blend the ingredients in batches  then together 
i never thought that someday i will give a negative    
i never thought that someday i will give a negative feedback to a product that amazon sells  i received the product today and just opened the box and pluged it  i just press the on button once to blender my shake and pofff  product burned instantly and never worked again  i couldnt used this product even once  please do not buy this blender in any circumstances  i ve never seen that much low quality product in my life 
this blender was completely disappointing  its cheap  not    
this blender was completely disappointing  its cheap  not just in price but in quality  everything is plastic  you can find other blenders for the same price that everything is glass and its going to be a lot more durable  it broke when it tried to blend the ice for a smoothie  so on the second time i used it it broke  not durable for smoothies 
piece of junk    
absolutely awful  first one we ordered arrived with a rattle sound  turns out the motor was already broken into pieces before it shipped  got a replacement one and truly only used it for smoothies with fresh fruit  not even frozen fruit and after 3 months it just died suddenly  the motor won t even work anymore 
broke down within 3 months 
broke down within 3 months of buying the product  waste of money  buy something else 
gasket malfunction no response from amazon
do not buy this blender  the gasket  on which the blades are attached  popped out after the second time i washed it  i have been contacting customer support and have had no replies on how to resolve the issue or go about returning for a refund  in addition  the container is a very thin plastic  it took very long for this blender to blend  even without my issue i don t think the blender is worth the price i paid 
so disappointed    
i purchase this item off of amazon  i used it for smoothies and soups  it started smoking after using it less than 10 times  so disappointed and this company does not have a return policy  wish i had known that before hand
smoking motor
i so excited to receive my blender and thought hamilton beach was a good brand but i literally only used this blender 5 times before it started smoking and the motor went out  very dissatisfied and disappointed
cheap and not recommended
feels cheap and the bottom part that s under the blender where you connect it to the blender for it to spin fell off 
five stars
junk really junk  used four times and each time stunk like electric wires burning even with no load   to late to return  wish i used this item in the return timeframe   don t waste your money  
about the only thing it is good for is just blending protein powder and water or    
this product is worth about  10 00  it doesnt blend frozen fruit  your fruit comes out still in frozen hunks  it is loud  about the only thing it is good for is just blending protein powder and water or milk  forget spinach  because it is still large soggy peices that come out  this costed  40 and its a pos 
it s been exactly 6 months   my blender base is    
it s been exactly 6 months   my blender base is smoked out  i don t use it everyday   i was simply blending my black beans   mushrooms before it started to smoke  literally smoke was coming from the control buttons as well as underneath  i ve tried to find replacements  nothing    i m thinking of simply calling the manufacture  hopefully this didn t happen to all of them 
stop  do not buy this product 
i never do reviews but i have to warn you guys  this is the worst buy i have ever made in my life  never buy this product  it damaged just six months after i purchased it  spend your money on something better 
not recommended
lasted less than 2 weeks  it had a bit of a burning smell when doing shakes but when i tried cheese  as per the instructions  it completely smoked  not recommended 
you get what you pay for
the way its built the cup sometimes doesn t sit right so when you turn it on it jumps up off the base  what happened to me is that it jumped up one to manu times and knocked out all the rubber teeth that connects the blade to the base  save yourself the heartache because when it worked it was wonderful  on a positive note amazon returns could not be easier 
one star
this can t mix a think  instead of sending it back i throw it out
