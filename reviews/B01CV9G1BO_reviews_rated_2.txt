product looked clean but no operating system found
i just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions 
you get what you pay for 
i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  
warning  very heavily used hard drive  
bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason 
disappointing
disappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk 
scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label 
the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer 
buyer beware
these models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this 
not quite as described
item does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back 
two stars
its ok not great
bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    
bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems 
still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests
