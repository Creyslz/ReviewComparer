more worth for your money than i expected
after reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment 
excellent deal   good machine   packed well 
so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled 
the perfect ultra cheap gaming pc
there are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well 
gaming potato  love it    
pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato 
it works great  zero problems
i put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems 
looks good  works great  no complaints 
nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance 
great deal  great support from skytech 
this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be 
it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    
this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer 
no complaints 
so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied 
computer arrived like new  unused
computer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon 
great buy
my only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ 
so far so good 
no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   d
nice computer with usb 3 0
you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse 
like brand new   excellent deal
this refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer 
i absolutely love this computer
i absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future 
like new condition  
it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous 
mucho bang for the buck 
i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly 
thanks for a great experience
both orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanks
great computer  fired right up and works great
great computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc 
games with the best of them 
got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works 
best bang for your buck 
this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals 
vga display port output  slim design 
so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room 
steal of a deal
after reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc 
bargain computer that works great 
i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters 
hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there 
i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens 
this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    
this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues 
excellent deal
i m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent 
awesome
having researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      
excellent bargain
very pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train 
it works like it is brand new
ordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat 
clean machine and excellent support 
i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nice
great budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gaming
for anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out power
great desk top
computer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend 
so glad i bought this
for a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups 
impressed
very happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargain
all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    
bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram 
this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    
wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal 
quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3
the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology 
ordered 3  got 3 good pcs
received 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  
perfect computer for my mom  
i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat 
good value for a refurbished computer
i was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one 
the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    
the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies 
excellent computer
this is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in 
great customer service 
received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecno
super happy with purchase 
i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy 
what a great deal 
i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion 
mine runs great 
60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error 
great deal  even better customer service 
great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great 
works like a champ
i use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet 
bargain price for a solid machine
much nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain 
excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    
excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanks
nice little package
i compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor 
    computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up
i was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10
very surprised by the quality
for    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers 
better than i thought it would be  
so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  
a bad ass bargain hot rod 
wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years 
a great bargain
received the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store 
works like a charm at a discounted price
was a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase 
good deal
got this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price 
great computer
very good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service 
great    
super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs 
i had none of the negative issues that some people    
i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month 
very happy with this machine so far
very happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse included
very please with this upgrade
installed and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade 
mine is great idk about all these other reviews       
i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard 
this computer is perfect
to be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier 
this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    
this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly 
great deal on a computer
a good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again 
it does the job 
after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries 
a five star experience from start to finish
my refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish 
solid pc for the price 
this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware 
very easy setup  everything went smoothly
just as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter 
essential for a budget gaming build 
arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee 
great value  works well and looks good
love it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds 
pretty and practical
for day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus 
great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy more
loving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office 
great pc  mine looked brand new  fast
excellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase 
ustecno is awesome
the first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the price
delightfully i received a real good one
extremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious 
great for the money
great computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  
a great experience 
computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism 
its a performer 
the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks 
great cheap gaming computer
love it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that much
good computer  ready to work  and great price
this computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase 
omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every penny
this pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram 
amazing computer for super entry level cost
when the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all 
perfect price great computer
this is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  
issue cleared up
it does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected 
not so good   called amazon
first one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleased
just unbelievably awesome for the price
just unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  
great support
older unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks 
works great for the investment
works great for the investment  was clean on the inside and out and ran flawlessly from first boot  perfect network machine for small home office 
better than advertised
the computer and accessories were all present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed 
works like a champ
works like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but windows 10 works fine  it does take a little getting used to   but this is so much faster 
this unit looks like new  works like new and has no noise    
this unit looks like new  works like new and has no noise at all  came with a new wired mouse and key board  even thou i thought it wouldn t  work well and down loaded everything i had on my old computer with no problems  very happy with this unit 
amazing price for a great computer
amazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase 
very nice computer 
i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat 
great computer for average user 
perfect computer for kids playroom  kids use it for online gaming  and some times even homework  more than enough ram and speed for average use 
good buy
great buy  good price for a i5 processor and windows 10  works great and came with a nice mouse and key board  great for an internet or word processing machine for the office  would buy again for sure 
i like this pc a lot when it got here i    
i like this pc a lot when it got here i opened it and was so happy to see it powered on with no issues  the copy of windows 10 was a bit out of date so i put a fresh install of windows 10 pro  i bought a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip 
great value and good performance
took a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion  included new keyboard and mouse also  which was nice  good purchase and i am glad i went this route 
that is amazing 23 hrs and comming from canada to arizona
received replacement unit after talking to jessica in customer service to describe minor defect in original unit i received the relacement in 23 hrs after talking with her that is amazing 23 hrs and comming from canada to arizona  with in 30 minutes after delivery i had the unit up and going  working perfect  unit is clean and looks like new i would recommend this seller to anyone  great customer service  thank you  bill
a good machine for professional usage 
product arrived on time   exactly as advertised  i needed a cheaper but function win 10 pro as a back up in my work from home system and this fits the bill very nicely  good price  received in good condition 
outstanding value 
bought several of these  outstanding quality and ease of installation  note that these are sff  small form factor  pcs so if you want a fancier gpu  you ll need a sff card 
    came with windows 10 pro and it has very good graphics built in no problems on start up everything    
i ordered the hp 8300 sf pc after reading the reviews on amazon this computer is very fast and came with windows 10 pro and it has very good graphics built in no problems on start up everything updated and it is working great i would recommend this computer to anyone who is looking to buy a new computer
dented  but great performer 
mine came with a huge dent in the side wall  however  being a refurbished computer  i knew that it would not be perfect  but it is perfect  it has windows 10 professional  runs nice and smooth and it is fast  it is a small tower  easy to carry if necessary  i regret not having wireless wi fi  and no documentation  billing or numbers disk for windows   but for the price and the performance  i can t complain  i m very happy with this purchase 
five stars
is perfect  all right  just a few stripes in the case  nothing to worry about
this is great pc for a dedicated streaming computer for streaming xbox    
this is great pc for a dedicated streaming computer for streaming xbox or playstation using the elgato hd60 or above  pros  very clean out of the box  easy to setup easy to activate windows 10 pro    just take a pic of the keygen before activating it helps   packaging was supiorer with foam incerts inside the box  cons  does not come with hdmi old school keyboard no speakers no media card reader
great price and easy set up
great price and easy set up  once i figured out how to register windows 10  and change my settings away from sleep mode  love it 
a steal
virtually no differences from brand new in the one i received  very fast  could use an ssd tho  and quiet  couldn t be happier  especially at this price point 
love this computer
love this computer  my old one just suddenly crashed  so i bought this one  my older one had an i3 and was so much slower  i just use this as my  main  puter for social media and bills  email  etc  i post stuff to 4 different sites and the old machine was so slow in comparison  very happy with this purchase  highly recommended 
exactly as advertised

bought this to replace my mother s 5 year old machine after it started having issues  works extremely well and has no issues 
installed in business office and works well 
performs great  easy to work on   upgrade
better parts than said 
so i ordered this computer for my dad and it came with a i7 instead of the i5  seeing how the i7 can usually beat the i5 all the time  i was very happy about buying this computer  but  it doesn t stop there  this package said it came with a 500gb hard drive  well try a 2tb instead of 500gb  the ram that came with this computer is 4gb x2  since i had a extra 8gb of ddr3 the computer now runs on 16gbs  this was well worth it and i might be buying one again later on in life 
would recommend this computer to friends and family
received this desktop and was very impressed  set up the computer immediately after opening the box and it worked  would recommend this computer to friends and family  if you are looking for an inexpensive desktop this would be the one 
but otherwise appeared in like new condition
pc arrived with minor blemishes on exterior case  but otherwise appeared in like new condition  the windows 10 that was installed needed extensive updates  but that was expected  clean install of windows 10 on a 250g ssd that i added  and this is a snappy little pc  especially for home application  very pleased with this refurb 
works great  very inexpensive
works great  very inexpensive  fast  easy to use  good for word processing and simple tasks  bought two for office 
computer looked like ne inside and out
computer looked like ne inside and out  functioned out of the box as advertised  great value for the money  more than adequate for what we do  surf  word  excel  music   pictures  etc 
worth the money  
this is a really really nice used pc    mine came with  count em  12gb of ram     i am totally satisfied and would purchase another with complete confidence   
fast and affordable 
i ve purchased two of these now  i actually had an issue with the second one and the market place vendor provided excellent customer service  response  and a quick replacement  overall a great  fast computer  very pleased

drinking the refurb kool aid 
this was a great purchase  the computer arrived super fast  and super clean  i admit i was hesitant at first to buy refurbished but this unit alleviated any concern  every system spec was as detailed in the item description and i was up and running in 20 minutes  the unit was so clean inside and out that i would have never known it wasn t brand new  have not had a single issue with it  and i am using it for everything from browsing to online gaming to photo editing  and not having to deal with the bloat ware that comes on other computers is phenomenal  fantastic  fantastic  fantastic 
five stars

i bought this with the 3yr extended warranty  and i couldn t be happier with the performance  and you can t beat the price  i may expand the memory if it doesn t satisfy me at some point  but that s super cheap 
great buy
so just received my computer  came with ast keyboard and mouse  sealed nicely in plastic and boxed twice  outer most box had a bit of damage but the computer had 1 scratch on the whole thing  opened it up and it looked brand new booted up first time after adding a gt 1030 lp gpu and runs like a dream  yet to test anything demanding on it but so far 10 10 
five stars
delivered as  promised   looks liek new and works as expected
power supply failure
both my power supply and my roommates on the same machine has started making horrible noises
solid performance at a great price  and quiet 
runs quiet  very straightforward machine with solid performance  works well as an entry level gamer after adding small format msi gts 1050 ti video card 
i like it 
received this yesterday  so i will update this review if my opinion changes  great computer  i work mostly at home and needed a new computer and decided to go with a cheaper desktop  haven t really installed any big programs yet  will probably install office  came with windows 10  which works fine  you have to authenticate windows using key on the back of the computer  there s a sheet of paper that comes with it stating this  but i am always the person that throws that crap away  so fyi  has no hdmi but does have display port  i had to order a hdmi to display port cable  right now i have it hooked up via vga  i clearly have little knowledge in reviewing a computer but bottom line if your looking for a basic desktop i would recommend  plus reading other  more computer inclined reviewers  seems pretty good    updated still loving it  fast  simple  awesome  
very pleased with this purchase
pc was professionally packed  very clean  very pleased with this purchase  this is exactly what i was looking for  a fast processor with a basic case  i can always modify the mobo  awesome vendor  true quality

after a couple of months
i ll start with what i feel  very happy  very minor wear or scratch marks  i m very pleased it plays my older steam games great and with graphics up  it also plays sims 1 3 fantastically  even with all expansions and graphics up  the sims 4 runs great with medium range graphics  everything runs great and fast  i have never had a desktop for over a decade now  feels good to have one and it actually has windows 10 and runs smoothly  for the good  fast and runs the games i want playable even with better graphics  very easy to set up almost looks new size is smaller and lighter than predicted got here in time and was very affordable runs quiet all the time 10 usb ports  idk why but it s nice to have  came with brand new wired keyboard  wired mouse  and mouse pad   very nice thank you  has a quiet sound card built in just in case you don t have speakers to hook up now for the bad  windows 10 isn t activated    code for activation is on a sticker to scratch off   only 500gb hdd no built in wifi   but my old xbox wifi adapter works fine    usb  can t personalize almost anything because it s not activated  no hdmi higher end games do not run well   not what i bought it for anyways   doesn t come with a vga cable last thoughts  super affordable  but sucks it s not activated    came with new accessories which was cool  runs my older game great with graphics on  with the pros and cons this was good buy for me at least  i can do most of my office things and games with no slowing down  my almost looks brand new and i m very grateful for that  great buy and i m happy i have a desktop once again 
five stars
excellent for the money
five stars
works great for a really great price  no problems at all 
set up was easy and after updating worked just fine
works well  using it for a media server and general web usage  set up was easy and after updating worked just fine 
perfect 
boots quickly  and when i juiced it up with a ssd drive and for the primary  and 19 gb of ram will serve me well for years 
speed and windows 10 
faster and greater capacity than my old dell windows 7 desktop  this is windows 10 
best bang for the money
i bought this desktop to use as htpc and i m happy with it  it had some scratch and dent but it performs just as new desktop 
plenty of capability  and the price was great 
the price was great  and it has more than enough capability for anything i need to do  including maintaining my websites 
best deal in desktops out there
dollar for performance  this is the best deal out there  fast processor for basic needs  easily upgradeable ram hd  i run mine with a ssd  2tb hdd  16gb ram and a geforce ft 730 low profile gpu  i use it for work  photo editing  and believe it or not  gaming  i don t run anything very intense  but i ve had a lot of success running elder scrolls online  medium   dota 2  high   league of legends  high   and company of heroes  don t expect this to be a gaming pc  but it s sufficient as long as you re not expecting it to play everything on ultra  plays eso on low settings without a gpu  i get around 60 90fps eso with the gt730 
good product for the price
for the price you pay the amount of ram and memory you get is a steal  you can always upgrade the computer later too if you know what you re doing 
stays cool  no problems so far
just using it for a pfsense router it is quiet  stays cool  no problems so far 
it works better than i hoped
what a deal  i just needed this computer for streaming tv shows  movies  youtube etc  it works better than i hoped  i m very satisfied and think this is a great deal  i was buying dell in the past but always had a problem  this computer and the company microbee is the answer to my prayers 
five stars

great pc for the money and with upgrades can be used for gaming 
okay so just wanna start off by saying this is one of the best computers you can get for the money if you are looking to get into pc gaming then this is the pc this paired with the gtx 1050ti or 1050 plain makes a simple mid range gaming pc that can run fortnite at 100  fps on ultra settings and tom clancy s rainbow six siege at 60  fps on ultra settings

i m a guy on a budget so when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop but didn t want to spend on a brand new one  found these great refurbished small form factor desktops with all the speed and processing i was looking for  i love the small form and i love the price   once the package arrived i opened the desktop so i could see it s upgrade potential as the descriptions fall a bit short as to how much one can upgrade the system  i was happy to find that there are several unused pcie slots and other unused connections inside  im very happy with its performance so far and look forward to seeing all this baby can do with future upgrades

best pc i ever bought for the cost
best pc i ever bought for the cost  was very similar to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that 
it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out
hey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it

very nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components 
very nice pc for the price 
arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning

great product and fantastic customer service
2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier 
worked as intended 
have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine

fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered 
fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40

got it for my dad  it works 
five stars
no glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much 
works well
the pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor

great computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   
one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again 
the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    
the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat great
solid computer and good customer service
we purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes 
it looks like new and if you are worried
bought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port 
this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    
wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with 
works fine  needs a wifi adapter though
had it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games 
five stars
