excellent deal   good machine   packed well 
so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled 
more worth for your money than i expected
after reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment 
the perfect ultra cheap gaming pc
there are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well 
gaming potato  love it    
pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato 
it works great  zero problems
i put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems 
looks good  works great  no complaints 
nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance 
it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    
this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer 
no complaints 
so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied 
great buy
my only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ 
so far so good 
no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   d
nice computer with usb 3 0
you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse 
like brand new   excellent deal
this refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer 
like new condition  
it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous 
mucho bang for the buck 
i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly 
vga display port output  slim design 
so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room 
thanks for a great experience
both orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanks
great computer  fired right up and works great
great computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc 
hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there 
i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens 
best bang for your buck 
this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals 
steal of a deal
after reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc 
bargain computer that works great 
i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters 
this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    
this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues 
excellent deal
i m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent 
excellent bargain
very pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train 
awesome
having researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      
it works like it is brand new
ordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat 
clean machine and excellent support 
i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nice
great budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gaming
for anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out power
great desk top
computer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend 
so glad i bought this
for a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups 
a good  solid basic machine for home users
this was bought to replace a linux machine that crashed  so one of the first things i did was put in a second 500 gb hard drive with linux on it  it dual boots with windows 10  i also added a video card  although i had to cut down the height of the bracket to make it fit  with those changes  i was able to carry on in linux as usual and occasionally boot into windows  which has the advantage of finally recognizing a canon laser printer i d gotten at a low price  only to find out linux and canon don t always get along  since windows is a virus malware magnet and i don t plan to pay for antivirus protection  i m sticking with linux about 99  of the time  the machine arrived from toronto in very good condition  looking basically new  some reviews seem to indicate condition can be a crapshoot  but i must ve gotten one from one of the good places  i ve bought refurbished machines before  but this was my first online purchase of one  i bought mine nine months ago and it s been working well  i ve had good experiences with hp machines both new and refurbished 
impressed
very happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargain
all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    
bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram 
this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    
wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal 
quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3
the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology 
ordered 3  got 3 good pcs
received 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  
perfect computer for my mom  
i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat 
good value for a refurbished computer
i was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one 
excellent computer
this is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in 
the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    
the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies 
great customer service 
received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecno
super happy with purchase 
i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy 
what a great deal 
i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion 
mine runs great 
60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error 
works like a champ
i use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet 
bargain price for a solid machine
much nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain 
excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    
excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanks
nice little package
i compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor 
very surprised by the quality
for    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers 
better than i thought it would be  
so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  
a great bargain
received the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store 
works like a charm at a discounted price
was a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase 
good deal
got this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price 
computer arrived like new  unused
computer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon 
great computer
very good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service 
i had none of the negative issues that some people    
i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month 
very happy with this machine so far
very happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse included
mine is great idk about all these other reviews       
i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard
