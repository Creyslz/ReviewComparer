stay away from acer
the gripes i have about this display has taken my rating down to 3 stars  got the monitors  color reproduction actually amazed me  coming from acer especially  i didn t have any backlight bleed worth complaining about  and i m picky  just poor viewing angles  for ips  unfortunately so   the backlighting panel behind the lcd display was shifted leftward  when i had these both angled with the monitors meeting directly in front of me  this caused a  translucent  effect on the right side of the displays  if the backlight panel was slightly wider  or just positioned more to the center  this wouldn t be an issue  i bought 2 monitors and both had the backlight panel shifted left  so it was either a bad lot  or poor quality control  also  no vesa mount  so my double sided tape method only worked for a few days before it began to peel  tried two different style tapes from 3m   i think i m staying far away from acer  last year i bought one of their  premium  laptops and ended up returning it about a week into owning it because of a fan issue  acer just makes budget products  plain and simple  don t expect much quality 
solid display  terrible stand 
for the price this is a very tempting 1440p monitor  but they re issues with this  to keep things short and sweet  i ll simply use a pro and cons list  pros  display itself is amazing  extremely clear image with no measurable back light bleed on my model  the jump from 1080 to 1440 is extremely impressive and this monitor is a great example   cost  for less then  300 you are getting a prime example of how much better the higher resolution can be  cons  the stand  this is the largest let down  it s truely terrible  unless you plan on placing this thing on a brick wall it will shake with any slightly movement in it s stand  just typing alone can cause it to wobble  the reason is the stand is the same with this size display as compaired to a 21  acer unit  seriously  it s that bad that it warrants a paragraph complaining about it   speakers  you can t expect greatness out of built in speakers  but these are pretty terrible  they point down from the rear of the monitor and it shows  lots of distortion at higher volumes   60hz  shouldn t expect more for this price  but its a hard lock on 60hz  any attempt to overclock will be meet with skipped frames  highest overclock i found reported was 65hz with a rumored 70  but my unit couldn t exceed 61hz without issues  in summary  there are some large issues but can be looked over if you can fall in love with the display  the deal breaker for me was the stand  the constant shaking forced me to return this product  but it might be a good fit for you 
passable as a cheap cheap secondary budget monitor
models vary      this review    is of the bottom of the line 19 5  1600 x 900 dpi g206hql  i bought the bottom of this series on a whim as a backup monitor  one should always have a backup monitor eh  it was only  79 99  i had one of my security monitors die today  i finally unboxed the acer g206hql the good  it comes with both vga and dvi d cables  aside from power supply and stand   it will tilt forward or backwards about  i m guessing  15   20 degrees  the bad  it s a cheap  lackluster display output  maybe it would look better of my video card on that system had dvi output  i find going from vga to dvi gains about 10  of  snap  or better picture quality  this will be  something  for now  but even for my security camera output which is 3megapixel  this is not true hd  moral  you get what you pay for  there is no way this would work as a main   production monitor for business use  text legibility   even casual surfing would be a bit tedious on this  only buy this if you really don t care or are on a budget  who knows maybe the ones up the ladder in this model series are a bit better  i can t speak to that 
maybe not the best choise
just 3 stars because quality control isn t good on this products     my monitor have 5 stuck pixels right out of the box  4 green and 1 red  overall is a nice product  but not as  cheap  as i thought the stand is nice looking but useless     you can t adjust in any direction the monitor comes with a nice set of cables  dvi  hdmi  display port and 3 5mm audio too   box is really small  i was surprised by that  it s a shame that mines come with 5 stuck pixels and i pay 100u d to forward the monitor to argentina if i wanted an exchange of this imperfect monitor i would have to spend another 200  100 to send it back and 100 to receive another  i asked amazon a week before buy if please they can t check the monitor looking for dead pixels before send  i know it is not intended for them but as i prime member  i was  we should get this quality control for this kind of product  with lots of claims about pixels problems  i think five pixels is enought to receive a refund or maybe a partial one in my case i will uploading some pictures later overall i like it anyways    the pixels are very very tiny making almost impossible to see since they are stuck pixels  not dead ones  they are only visible in black screen  windows loading for example  and there is a glimmer of hope that eventually it will disappear
good while it lasted   died after 2 months
i must have gotten a lemon  because this monitor totally died on me out of the blue after only 2 months  i was using my computer and it just went kaput  it had some brown outs leading up to the sudden death but i didn t think much of them   perhaps that was foreshadowing of the fate of the monitor  or hints that the monitor was faulty to begin with  fortunately  i was able to return the dud for a refund  i would ve given this monitor another chance if it was available when i returned the original  but at the time it was not  so i replaced it with an hp monitor  i was happy with the acer monitor while i had it  the picture was clear and it was very easy to hook up and use 
great beginner 1440p with overclocking refresh rate but glare that can be annoying 
if you are looking for a cheap 1440p monitor that you can overclock the refresh rate then this is a great monitor  i manage to get mine to sit at 80hz no problem  there are a few issues though  if they weren t visual then i wouldn t dock too much from it but they are  i knew ips monitors glare easily but i always assumed that the glare would come from something else  the glare on my monitor comes from the monitor  the position i sit causes the glare to show up near the bottom and a little on the top  the glare moves around as i move around  the fortunate part is this is only obvious when the background is dark and my brain eventually ignores it if i m not paying too much attention to it  second issue i have is depending on the window i can see the pixels when windows are moved  i tried switching ports  updating drivers  and etc  thankfully this is only obvious with certain windows  the color of the window for discord is perfect and when i move it around it s very obvious  but others it s very faint or i don t see it at all  if this changes in the future i will update my review  do i recommend this  yes  if you really want a 1440p monitor but don t want to shell out 500  then this is perfect  just don t expect the monitor to be perfect 
decent monitor
decent monitor  blacks are a bit washed out  i have this paired with 2 same size lcd displays and you can see a big difference in brightness and contrast  viewing angle is not great on the vertical  as it wants to be tilted back a bit  in my setup anyway 
power cord broke after three weeks
this monitor is easy to install  looks good  and worked well until today   when it went black  it wouldn t turn on at all  i managed to plug my toshiba laptop s power cord into it  and now it works   but of course now i m without a powersource for my laptop  my other complaint about the monitor is minor  the blue led light on the bottom flashes super bright when the monitor is not in use and the computer  that it s attached to  is asleep  it lights up the whole house while pulsating  and i think my neighbors might suspect i m looking for aliens  but possibly there s a way to turn that thing off  and even if not  it s easy enough to turn off the power button on the monitor itself  this would get four or even five stars  except that the power cord broke so ridiculously soon  three weeks is a very  very short time  i ll see whethdr i can get a replacement cord for it and i ll report back 
what colors   
have to say  i am disappointed with this monitor  while its build quality is good  i ve never had an issue with acer quality of construction  the image presented leaves much to be desired  no matter how much i play with the settings  the deepest black is a medium shade of grey  colors are flat and bland  no vibrancy at all  i am connnecting my geforce 760ti via dvi connector to the monitor  so its not like i am facing a vga cable limitation  i have an 8 year old 36  720p sanyo flatpanel tv for a secondary monitor and its colors are much better  which is sad to say  no amount of fiddling with either my video card settings or the monitor settings can produce a better result 
good general monitor for the price  but the brightness is a bit of a hassle 
this is a very clear screen  it is large  and looks magnificient for gaming  it is very lightweight and thin  its true what other reviews say  the stand is somewhat cheaply constructed  and the screen can t be tilted unless you take the stand apart and adjust it  that isn t a problem for me  as the straight up and down angle is fine  and the stand sits undisturbed on my desk so there s no worries it will get jarred  if you had a cat or kids  the stand seems like it could easily break  the missing star isn t for the stand though   the missing star is because while the monitor has a mostly perfect picture for games  movies  and the like  for some reason the brightness level sucks really bad for office type of applications  and the general desktop  and browser windows  yea  you can adjust your systems brightness to make it a little easier on the eyes  but with my old monitor i never had to do that  i could leave the settings the same for anything  if i want to play a game or something  i have to go in and change my brightness settings  otherwise the sheer intensity of the brightness makes my brain hurt a bit  edited 11 2 16  after having owned this monitor for several months i ve come to realize that its a slight flicker that s really the problem  a lot of people  my girlfriend  my best friend  my mom  have absolutely zero problems with this  i m sensitive to it  however  and it gives me a headache and makes me feel sick after sitting in front of it for an hour or two  no matter how i adjust the settings  it always makes me feel like i m on a roller coaster  i get the same kind of virtigo feeling  i feel this monitor may not be good for people who are sensitive to flashing lights or who have motion sickness problems  i m changing my star rating from the original 4 to a 3  i m actually going to have to replace this monitor with a different one  but its probably still a good monitor for those not sensitive to it s weaknesses 
just okay  budget monitor  not recommended unless the features are what you need in your budget
it s a good budget monitor if you just need one to do normal things  however  if you need a monitor that can display blacks well  this is not the monitor you ll want  you ll be frustrated with photoshop or painter trying to see what you re working on with darker colors  the bottom of the panel is the worst area for light bleed  i ended up just using my old matte tft flat screen monitor by acer  my old one isn t true hd  but the overall quality of the image ends up better than with this one  to be completely  humbly honest  i would rather work with a big crt monitor on my desk than this monitor   alas  space does not allow  it looks good sitting there though  and it s good enough for those who need a low cost monitor with dvi   vga  however  i would not recommend it to anyone i know  and certainly not for those who need to get work done  even typing in word was unpleasant enough for me to actually notice it was more unpleasant than usual to be writing a paper   however  response time is good  no ghosting that i ve noticed in my games and movies that i ve watched  just adding here that now i have learned that the issue i have with this monitor is  ips glow   i was shopping for a new monitor at frys when i just had to research why so many had a white glow that makes the screen hard to see  i ended buying a non ips hd panel and am much happier with it  it was also cheaper than this one was 
good for the price  but has room for improvement  the stand is a pita 
this acer monitor gets the job done at 2560x1440  though it does have some issues  a breakdown of my experience  i ve been using it for two months as my primary monitor   pros   1440 resolution at an affordable price   good color reproduction  cons   the stand is terrible  if  as i do  you multipurpose your computer and do close up tasks  gaming  productivity  and far away tasks  movies  the ability to adjust the monitor angle is critical  on this monitor  you must grab the top of the monitor  hard  and the base  and really work at making it move  non vesa  not easily adjustable   buttons are cheap and hard to actuate  including the power button   the big silver bezel is   shall we say unattractive  i ve had the monitor for a while and i still find it distracting   screen brightness is a little non uniform  not enough to really bother me  but it s definitely darker at the edges  not really a con  but just fyi  this monitor does not overclock well  would i buy it again  honestly  the stand issue bothers me more than it probably should  probably because i have to adjust it so often   if you re a set it and forget it kind of user  this is a pretty good monitor for the price 
it didn t feel like it was going to break
it worked  the stand  as everyone has said  was flimsy plastic  but not as flimsy as i expected  it didn t feel like it was going to break  no dead pixels or anything  aesthetically pleasing design  the issue is the color quality  the colors are perpetually washed compared to other  even cheaper ips panels i ve used  investigating reveals the panel is a wide viewing angle equivalent of ips  not real ips  it s easily the cheapest 1440p monitor of its size  and it works  those are the good points  bad is the color  i sold it and bought a different monitor in the end 
you get what you pay for
i ordered two of these monitors for a dual screen work environment  they were only ok  not great  the two monitors had very different white balance  even for the same factory default settings  i tried to make them match  but couldn t quite get them looking the same  also  both monitors had a very faint spot  in the exact same place  where the picture was a little brighter than the rest of the monitor  i ended up returning these monitors and spending a little extra for a better monitor  i am going to be staring at these things 40 hours a week  after all
