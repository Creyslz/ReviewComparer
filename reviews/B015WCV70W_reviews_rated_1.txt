great value and picture  update  picture didn t last 
great value for the price  it is quite helpful that you can switch between the vga and hdmi inputs using either software or the second button on the front right underside next to the power button  this monitor has very good contrast of darks and lights  easy to set up  angle it before attaching the cables   and has roughly a 60 degree viewing angle  30 degrees on either side of dead center  in which the picture remains sharp and clear  so people sitting off center or next to the main user will still see a crisp accurate picture  it s very light but also very stable  update  not good value  it has been 2 months since purchase  the screen now produces stray dark lines from top to bottom  it is not the cable connection  if you pinch the black plastic frame around the screen glass just below the dark line  the dark line disappears temporarily until you stop pinching below it  unfortunate that this monitor didn t last beyond 2 months of limited use  no longer consider this a good value at all  2nd update  manufacturer wants credit card info  through chat  to replace the defective monitor still under warranty   instead of providing means to ship it back  like a shipping label so you know you aren t getting charged hidden fees  before getting the replacement  it reads too much like a cc scam so not worth it 
went bad in 1 year
we have owned this monitor for one year  today  lines and distorted images appeared on the screen indicating that it was going bad  upon calling tech support  they told us there would be a  59 99 fee for diagnostics  the monitor only cost  99 so  no we are not going to do that  i think a monitor should last more than 1 year  i do not recommend this product 
screen flashes black
the screen flashes black every once in a while like it s trying to change resolution  i ve updated the drivers for both the monitor and my graphics card to no avail  it s not an issue with my computer as my second monitor of a different brand works perfectly  if i ever find a resolution for this problem i ll change my rating and explain how to fix it in case others have the same problem 
easy set up
i got this today and pulled it out of the box  easy set up    except it won t turn on  pulled up reviews and most of the recent reviews have the exact same issue  note to self  read current reviews  what a dud  all parts clipped in nicely and it looks nice  but i need it to actually turn on  back it goes 
would be good if wasn t so self destructive 
the stand is terrible  it will not lock into place at all  and as such will easily dump the monitor onto your desk or floor at the slightest provocation  it s a shame  because the display itself is actually quite nice  if you re reading this and thinking  that s ok  i m going to put it on a mount  think again  you need a vesa adapter because they chose to forgo having that built in 
trash after only 6 months
i ve only had this monitor since february 2017  for the last couple of months  four months after purchase and now ineligible for return  a black line started to appear intermittently in the center of the screen  today  it is no longer intermittent  it s permanent  i ve updated every driver possible  done all of the troubleshooting but the line is on the monitor itself  not due to software issues  i m super disappointed because i m an illustrator and a line down the exact center of the screen is incredibly distracting and interferes with my digital work  what a waste of money since i now have to replace it only 6 months after purchase  the one time i should ve purchased the extended warranty   never needed to before  if you decide to purchase this monitor  buy the extended coverage 
while the monitor was inexpensive and had a great display for the price
lasted one year to the day that i received it  these 4 odd looking pixilated lines appeared in the middle of the screen and come and go  you only notice them on a white background  while the monitor was inexpensive and had a great display for the price  one year later it is time to start looking for a new one  of course the warranty has long run out 
spend an extra  50 and get something you won t regret 
the screen isn t real glass  it s like plastic or something  i already have three scratches on the surface which apparently scratched when my gaming headset and cord hung over the monitor  it doesn t balance well  always seems like it s about to fall forward  can t get the color to match my asus rog gaming laptop  but it s alright if you don t need good color i suppose  just seems washed out  lastly  the hdmi outlet is very sensitive  if anything so much as brushes the monitor i get a pixelated grey screen 
beautiful monitor died 79 days later
i really like this monitor until it died just 79 days after i bought it from amazon  according to the box  there is a 1 year warranty  i tried to contact hp about getting it fixed or replaced and they told me that there was a crack in the screen  but there isnt a crack in the screen  then they said  and i quote  it is on the inside and the leds are making the vertical lines because of the crack  but that doesnt account for the crazy jumping and bouncing and color changes over the rest of the monitor   see my photos   luckily  amazon has a fantastic customer service reputation and they want to keep me happy  they jumped in where hp failed miserably  im not getting the entire cost of the monitor back  but even a fraction at this point is way better than being accused of something i did not do  if you buy this monitor  beware of hps lack of warranty support and how they fight to make it your fault when clearly there is a problem with some of their monitors  i certainly hope you have a better experience than i do
