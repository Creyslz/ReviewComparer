it s okay   not great but not bad   update   i don t like it 
the best thing about this monitor is the price  however  you get what you pay for  the amazon 3 star rating of  it s okay  very accurately describes how i feel about this product  the color is ok  i was actually a bit disappointed in this because i selected an ips monitor for the better color reproduction   viewing angles are ok  should be a lot better on an ips   light bleed is a bit stronger than expected based on other reviews  especially in the lower corners   resolution is a plus but not very noticeable at 25   again   it s okay    minimal ghosting  some is expected w  60hz refresh   the monitor looks nice  the chrome accents really make it look like a high end item  the stand is garbage but i expected that based on other reviews so i didn t hold it against acer in this review  to quantify how bad the stand is  typing on the keyboard shakes the monitor   so that minimal amount of impact on a solid desk makes the monitor shake  the stand is like a point load in the center with a set of training wheels on either side that allows it to wobble but keeps it from falling down  when i get home i ll try to take a picture of the light bleed and post  update  i have attached pictures of the light bleed  my keyboard and mouse are lit up and you can see the monitor is actually brighter than those when showing a black screen  its pretty bad  also  while gaming and facing the monitor straight on  the color in the bottom corners gets washed out  not sure if anyone else has experienced this since other reviews praise this monitor for great color function so i m not sure if what i am experiencing is normal or if i just have a bad item  but i have changed my review from it s okay  to  i don t like it     i may send it back  additional clarity to review  my previous monitor was a 20  1920 x 1080 with ppi of 110 15  this monitor equates to a ppi of 117 49  as stated above  not very noticeable  to me    others may have a different experience coming from a different monitor  to add to this  some text fonts look blurry on this monitor  my previous monitor had no issues with any text  i don t need my eyes checked   this monitor is average at best  which agrees with the ideology  you get what you pay for  
an excellent monitor  if your lucky 
so  i bought one in january  spot on white point and color with moderate colorbleed  for the price  i can t believe how nice it is for the price  now for the bad  last week  a major price drop occurred and i bought another for a dual monitor setup  the second monitor had a yellow  near old paper  white  and could not be adjusted  this made for a terrible non matching dual monitor setup  i talked with amazon  and the sent a replacement  replacement came today  and yet again there was an issue where the original monitor and the third monitor do not match with a grey white point  all other colors were fixable  but the grey scale was way off and nonadjustable  contacted amazon again  and a fourth monitor has been sent  i really hope it will at least be a near match  i know very well a perfect match is not plausible   lesson of the day  this acer is theoretically an awesome monitor with wide color range and high brightness  in reality  this will only occur if your lucky  as i was on one   quality control is terrible to get 3 monitors with 3 very different color ranges   white points where all were manufactured within two months of each other 
inconsistent backlighting  washed out and viewing angles  still a cheap and functional monitor if you can get it on sale 
no signs of dead pixels or other outright failure to display  all 2 1 megapixels are here  but are they good  spoilers   not really  the backlighting differs between the top and bottom  colors are washed out and it looks white no matter how you adjust it  even the ideal viewing angle seems different between the top and the bottom  and this is made worse by the lack of tilt and elevation features  i m not even a graphic designer and sometimes the quality just irritates me  still  i bought this during a flash sale for 70    at that price i can t fault it  however at almost 100  i d look at something else  and i kind of regret it at that price 
great display  poor quality everything else 
i purchased a pair of these monitors as a cheaper alternative to the dell 25  monitors i have at work  as far as i can tell these use the same panel as the dell 25  2560x1440p ultrasharps and they were around  80  100 cheaper  the display and color reproduction is amazing  i do a ton of development and moving from a tn panel to an ips panel made a world of difference and the higher resolution means more code on screen  the display also had no stuck pixels at all  so why does it get 2 stars  well  the devil is in the details  whoever made the panel  i didn t look it up  is it samsung  someone else   gets 5 stars  but acer s implementation of it gets 1 star  the bezels are popping off the sides  causing light to bleed through outside the panel  i noticed this after the return period  otherwise i would have returned them   also the issue is not caused by the vesa adapters mount that i mention below  it happened    i dare not attempt to rma these monitors  back when i first purchased them i couldn t even find a page for this model on acer s site  i ve also heard horror stories  after purchasing  of course  of users receiving doa units as replacements from acer when rmaing various products  also  the monitors are not vesa compatible  recently i found out how important this is when i decided i wanted a monitor mount in order to make more room on my desk  the only way i could find to make these things work with the mount was to buy a 3rd party adapter  which has it s own flaws  for each of the monitors   2 of these totaled  83 which put the price quite a bit closer to the dell monitors i mentioned earlier  i m still begrudgingly using these monitors  but i do not recommend them and i ve decided  after 2 generations of monitors  i will never buy anything acer branded again 
the low end
these monitors are pretty low quality  washed out blacks and blown out whites   so there s really no way to recover the color saturation quality due to how cheapy they are  tasks this monitor is good for  browsing the web tasks this monitor is not good for  watching movies graphic design web development anything that requires color accuracy i looked for help online that would tell me how to correct the color  but i couldn t find anything  if you re just wanting a monitor for the sake of having a monitor  this definitely works  however  if you do any sort of design  development  graphic design or any other task that needs color quality  i wouldn t recommend this monitor  i gave it 2 stars  because i don t think this monitor is meant to be great  but it s definitely priced out of its category  i d recommend a  99 00 price tag for a monitor like this 
shady practices on repair policies
honestly would never buy acer again  very shady business practices  i had this monitor for 32 days before it decided to not turn on at all  the ac unit worked fine  all outlets worked fine  i called acer for support  and it was determined that it had to be sent in for repairs  this wouldn t be the worst thing except for the fact that shipping to acer is not covered under warranty  so what did this mean  i had to pay an  84 shipping charge for my 32 day old   180 product because it was faulty  the only reason i am going to give this one star is because the product itself was nice for the 30 days of actual use  otherwise  buy another brand  update  after nearly 2 weeks from shipping to return  i finally got my monitor back  it was deemed that the monitor was fully functional after testing for 24 hours and they were unable to replicate the issue  i plugged it back in and same issue  it would not turn on  this leads me to believe that it is the a c power adapter included with the monitor that is the issue  upon further investigation into reviews from newegg and other sites  acer is widely known to not qc their included parts correctly  and this is a fairly common issue for the ac adapter to cease working after a short amount of time  typically 1 month   for those also having this issue  the adapter appears to be working still as the light is on  but it may be some connection passed the middle point  in conclusion  i basically just spent  84 on a  200 monitor for repairs that weren t needed and now end up having to spend an additional  15 out of pocket to get a new power adapter because acer makes shoddy accessory pieces  i will never buy a thing from this company again 
not vesa compatible  new models require an adapter 
i have older versions of these monitors  which have vesa mounting and were superceded with later model variants  i didn t even bother to check the very bottom bullet of the description because why would a manufacturer make their product less appealing and with less functionality  well  joke s on me  imagine my surprise when i unboxed this and the back cover is completely different than my other 2 21 5  acer led monitors   vesa available  means it s not compatible and acer superceded their models with non vesa compatible models for some reason  what the heck  just wanted to get the same model so i could have multiple monitors  now i have to buy a stupid adapter  and the monitors won t line up right  thanks acer  my money will be going elsewhere next time  don t take functionality away for the sake of selling adapters
