the plastic bottom is super cheap  and even with the lid on the    
i wanted the glass for hot things  i actually brew my coffee straight into this and blend it   but it leaks  it s leaked more than a few times out of the bottom  we tighten it and rescrew it on  but it s never 100   the plastic bottom is super cheap  and even with the lid on the liquid still shoots out of the cracks  they just don t make them like they used to 
what did you expect for the money  you got it 
it s ok  i mean  it s a cheap blender  but it has a glass pitcher  it works fine  it seems to do a better job than its predecessor at mixing frozen drinks with ice  probably as good as it gets for the money  and if you want something better  more versatile  more powerful  etc  then you ll need to fork over more cash i expect  quite satisfactory  copacetic  bueno 
loud 
so yes  it s a blender and it works     however  it s one of the loudest blenders i ve ever owned   sounds like a frickin  cessna reving up on the runway preparing for take off  can t use it in the morning because it wakes the entire household so am forced to make smoothies in the evening and fridge store them  i suggest you choose another brand over this one 
well  what do you expect 
no  it s not elegant looking  and it is indeed loud  but what do you expect  black and decker is known for its loud  macho power tools  and basically that s what you have here   a loud  macho kitchen power tool  i appreciate the sturdy glass container and the fact that the basic design is a simple one  i do recommend following the instruction book s advice to press the pulse button a few times when blending frozen fruit or clunky items into a drink before setting it to a full blend  even doing that  though  smoothies can come out a bit lumpy  for the price  though  it s a bargain and does the job well enough 
not as good as a previous model of theirs for the same    
gets the job done  but noisy  not as good as a previous model of theirs for the same price 
not intended for daily use
no complaints about it  it does the job    but if you are going to use it daily i d buy a different one    
gets the job done 
meh  not the sturdiest thing in the world but it does the job  the motor is also not the greatest  but i just needed something for a rental  so i m fine with it 
not too powerful but does work 
black and decker blender works well  smoothie i was making was a little too thick but the blade stopped  would recommend something a little stronger 
three stars
it works ok  makes smoothies with frozen fruit no problem  it is sort of loud
not as efficient as my previous b  d  glass    
not as efficient as my previous b  d  glass lip flaked off  my last blender  same mfg  flaked at bottom rim  leary of futher b   d blenders
its obviously not a ninja and you have to be very smart about the order in which you place things or    
its a decent blender it does what its supposed to  its obviously not a ninja and you have to be very smart about the order in which you place things or else its stops 
while it does the job it also gets over heated    
while it does the job it also gets over heated and the more i use it  just for morning smoothies   the more it overheats and i can smell plasticy stuff
