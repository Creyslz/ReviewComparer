arrived damaged
the shelves are sturdy and easy to put together   very pleased with the unit  however  one of the shelves arrived significantly bent  disappointed to receive a damaged product 
good
i ve bought and used a shelving unit  pretty much exactly like this one  but from walmart  and i think that one is slightly better quality  this shelf is fine  does the job  holds what i need it to hold  but i could only fit 3 of the 4 shelves if you wanted narrow shelves then i guess you could fit the 4th one on  but i don t feel like that d give you enough space for any  at least wouldn t give me enough space for what i am using the shelves for  the one i got from walmart was taller and seemed a little sturdier  not that amazon s is weak  easy to assemble  stays together and easy to take apart  tip  twist the poles to disconnect them from the shelves  a lot easier than trying to push pull the shelf off  
the sum total value is greater than each individual part 
decent value shelf definitely holds many items with its 5 shelves however assembling this product is an issue  it uses a plastic jacket part that you must squeeze together and slide down each shelves rod these jackets do not close completely however much i pressed  i even had to use a hammer to get the shelves even  it really was a struggle to assemble these shelves with this jacket mechanism  the end product is worth the struggle but i would give this 1 star if it was based solely on the parts   still a good value
sturdy and worth the money spent
sturdy and worth the money spent  packaging from manufacturer could be a lot better  tops of leg posts  plastic tops broken off because it was only secured in box with a small cardboard wrap and zip tied to one of the shelves  which was not intacted upon receiving 
love the leveling feet
there are two major things to note with these shelves  the first is that step 4 is not correct in the instructions  the instructions have an entire set of parts missing from the list manual  instead of screwing the poles into each other in step 4  you re meant to screw these male to male adapters into each end of the poles  d oh  i had set aside the adapters and  since i was following the instructions  though amazon had screwed up in manufacturing the product  minus one star here  the second thing to note is that you have to set the plastic pieces on the poles very particularly  there s a small line on the inside of the plastic that sits into the grooves on the poles   that s why some people find that the plastic pieces pop off  you have to set each side into these grooves and push them together tightly  they don t meet up on both sides for me  but the weight of the shelves will keep them in place  until the plastic degrades    minus one star for this   i have it set up in my pantry  which is a big closet without enough shelves   and the top it not all the way at the top  but it still seems plenty stable  love the leveling feet  which allowed me to adjust it to be perfectly stable against the wall  if you re storing things like sauce liquor bottles  you ll likely need a shelf mat  though  i ll probably update this in the future   i plan on moving next year and will be taking it with us  so i ll update on how well it makes it in a move  if nothing else    
damaged goods  feels good though 
nice looking shelf  feels pretty sturdy  until i was installing the last shelf  i believe it was damaged by shipping and since it is an amazon product  i feel that this should be part of the review  despite only one shelf being damaged  the unit stands tall and feels sturdy  time will tell 
shelf good   packaging sucks  
the shelf itself is a good  sturdy shelf that will hold lots of stuff  my problem is with the packaging and instructions  there were at least two dozen pieces of plastic parts in the box  i was stressed out trying to figure out where all these parts went  after a lot of studying and a call to amazon  i found out that the mfr calls these extra pieces  packing material  and they aren t used when assembling the shelf  what a load  it appears that these pieces are the trash left over after the pieces are molded and pressed  i just don t understand why they include the trash with the shelf when you purchase it  c mon amazon  what s up with your quality control   very confusing 
good product  terrible instructions booklet
it looks sturdy and serves its intended purpose  as described  assembling it took me quite a while longer than i suspect others would require  if you are a senior citizen and or a customer with poor vision  beware  the instructions for assembly come in a multilanguage booklet 3 50 x 4 25 inches  fleas are easier to see than the print on those pages  i had to scan its pages  then expand the jpegs and print them to see what the pages said  that is extremely frustrating  especially considering that a folding sheet would have allowed for instructions in all languages and still provided a clearer view of directions  i would only buy it again because  after assembling the second unit  i pretty much can do without the lilliputian print 
frustrating   missing piece 
the package that this thing arrived in was extremely beaten up and heavily taped over  it looked like it could possibly have been a return  when i opened it up  most of the pieces were floating around loose in the box  the pamphlet was stained  upon opening the pamphlet  the instructions were exceedingly poor  but i ultimately figured it out  as i was nearing completion of construction  i found that one of the clip pairs was missing  which meant that i could effectively use only 4 out of the 5 shelves  i can t find replacements anywhere  and i don t want to go through the hassle of returning this item  frustrating  other than these issues  the structure is basically sturdy and functional  if it would have arrived with all of the required pieces and without the packaging having been opened before  i d say this is a 4 5 star item
