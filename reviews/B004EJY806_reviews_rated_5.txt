so cute  great price 
i love this shelf  i ve been remodeling our upstairs myself for a few weeks and i was doing my craft room and kitchen and was getting a few  i need  items and ran across this for my craft room  i do a lot of diy and a ton of painting  furniture  our walls  everything  so i needed something with decent sized shelves for cans of paint  things like that  but i didn t want to spend an arm and a leg  i am remodeling an entire house  i can t blow our budget on one room  so this fit the bill  shipping was fast  package came in good shape  i put it together in about 8 minutes  at first i was concerned  it was shorter than i expected  clearly i didn t exactly read dimensions on the product description   but i figured for the price   hey  i ll make it work  and work it did  it was perfect for what i needed  and honestly in a month  i m probably going to order a couple more    it s sturdy and very pretty  understand the poles between the shelves are plastic  but you can t really tell unless you re touching them  i have pretty heavy supplies on it and it doen t lean or shake any  i have a crate full of spray paints on the top shelf and when taking it down or putting it up i have to worries about it breaking or toppling over on me  it matches my room perfectly and i couldn t be happier  i m quite happy it s not taller than it is  seeing as how i myself am vertically challenged and have to use a step stool to get that spray paint crate off the top shelf without getting flattened  overall  waaaaay better quality than i was expecting honestly 
space saver
excellent for the price  not as sturdy as a wood table but does amazingly the job  i needed to declutter my kitchen counter and i ve found this   i just displayed 3 tiers because it was too high for my kitchen and i used the 4th under my sink cabinet  on the top shelf is the microwave  on the second is my mini oven and on the bottom shelf is the rice cooker and things i put here and there  the bottom shelf is definitely the sturdiest  so happy with my purchase  i recommend this 
i love the size of it
i love the size of it  it s not too big but not too small  it doesn t take up a lot of space so it s perfect for small rooms like in apartments or townhouses  it fits a lot of stuff on it and it s sturdy for the price  the shelves are sturdy enough that i was able to stack a bunch of books on it as well as two laptops on another shelf  it was not difficult to assemble and i love the color 
works great in my bathroom   
i have deliberately waited quite awhile to voice my opinion on this product because i wanted to see how well it would hold up  i do not have anything really heavy on it  so i won t comment on its ability to hold weight or not  but i do have this in my bathroom  right next to my shower  this is why i waited to write this  i wanted to see how well it would fair in a room that is almost constantly moist and damp  it has far exceeded my expectations  the laminated veneer has not peeled or become unattached in any way  nor has it developed those little blister bubbles that you sometimes see on pieces with veneer  putting this shelf together was a breeze  it was delivered about half an hour before i needed to leave for work  and i was able to inbox it  screw the pieces together and move it into my bathroom all by myself  and still had time to spare before leaving for work  while i would in no way describe this shelf as flimsy  it is light weight  so if you have little ones or even elderly people in your home or office i would recommend that you anchor the shelf to the wall just to be safe  although i have not felt the need to do this in my own home  i am very happy with this shelf  and plan to purchase at least one or two more that i plan to try out with books 
five stars
very happy and purchased more 
a solid shelving system for this price range
i like these shelves a lot  they re a little shorter than i pictured in my head  but worked out perfectly for my craft room  while i wouldn t overload them with super heavy items  they re pretty study  the shelving system doesn t rock too much  stays together well  i like the color of the wood laminate  very neutral and bright  pros  sturdier than anticipated bright and clean a simple but well thought out design  with caps on the top shelf to cover the  pole holes   and small feet on the bottom to slightly elevate the shelf system  the laminate is a pleasant wood pattern and well wrapped  only a little laminate edge is visible around the shelf  as seen in the pictures   cons  a little smaller than i pictured  couldn t hold heavy books  but that s not what i bought it for  so no big deal there   errrr that s about it  this isn t a high end solid wood shelf  but for what i paid i am more than pleased with the quality  pictured  the full picture has all of my art room stuff on it  and a yard stick leaning in front for size comparison  the other two allow you to see the wood pattern and the tiny visible edge of the laminate  i had to get pretty close to be able to see that 
selves for product and organized
good produce for your work i love it
my favorite purchase for 2017 
love ittttttttt       this little shelf fits perfectly in my little office  right in a little corner as if it was made for that spot  my staff was jealous and it inspired them to order one also for behind their desk  its perfect for things you need close by with out being obstructive and in the way  matches the rest of my office furniture perfectly  i have several large file folders stored on it  paper for my printer  a plant and some other documents  its beautiful  and for the price   i can t rave enough  it is well made  strong  sturdy and super easy to put together  i literally put this together in 5 minutes myself with no tools  i will definetly purchase more from this collection  you can t go wrong trust me     who ever thought of this concept needs to be rewarded 
economical and useful   
very practical  and easy to assemble  i m 6 months pregnant and needed to create more space for the 2nd baby in my daughter s room and this worked perfectly  i really liked that it was easy to assemble  no screws or tools    just really good forearms that you ll need to twist these poles in and done  i completed the build in less than 30 min  my only complaint is that i really wish the was a tad bit wider so i could fit 2 storage boxes on one shelf instead of 1  the picture with the divider was a bit decieving  but now i get why they had it since those boxes are costum to that shelving unit  my daughter has a montessori like set up in her room so if she s in the closet  i m not worried about this falling on her since it s so light weight  that if it somehow did   which i highly doubt  she wouldn t get harmed  maybe a little shaken up  but probably not hurt  it did come with a mount to fix it to the wall for that reason  but i didn t use it yet  other than that  a very inexpensive way to organize a baby closet  i all probably get another one in the future when the girls are a little older and have accumulated more stuff  i give it 2 thumbs up 
these are great for adding shelves to any room for a great price 
very easy to assemble  sturdy  extremely affordable  there was some slight damage to the corners of the press particle board shelves of one of the two i bought but nothing worth sending back or complaining about  all the pvc pieces including the end caps were pristine and well packed  the pvc tubing connect to each other very well and do not rock or slip once tightened  i have a fairly weighty bose 301 book shelf speaker on the third shelf and a klipsch dolby atmos speaker on the top shelf of each making them very top heavy but i am confident that unless i do something stupid or there is an earthquake they ll be fine  they are both sitting directly on carpet and would tip over with a good nudge but they are steady and don t move or sway  i have both furinno shelves fairly far away from my wall so i cannot anchor them using the enclosed wall anchors but that is definitely a nice option  for the price and functionality the furinno turn n tube 4 tier shelves are a great buy 
no tools required   easy assembly
i was super pleasantly surprised with this  the box had 4 wood  particle board  flats which were slightly more impressive than the plastic i expected  12 plastic legs and 4 caps  and i think something to anchor it to the wall even  no tools  directions  or pictures which i was thrilled not to need  you just screw one leg into another with the shelves in between  all the holes and groves were properly placed and fit together exactly like they should and none of the shelves were cracked or chipped which  at this price  is nothing short of a miracle  the whole thing took about ten minutes and that was with my 2   4 yr olds helping me 
best purchase i ever made
these are the best thing since sliced bread  took all of 5 minutes to put one together and look at all the stuff they hold  i use them in my craft room  and i m thinking of getting another one to set up and take down at craft fairs  these guys are brilliant  they make a lot of different types of furniture that doesn t require tools  the tubes screw into each other and they hold up great  love love love   
it works 
it serves the purpose and it looks decent  i didnt want to spend a lot of money on shelves and this is the cheapest option i could find  it does look a little cheap overall but it works for me and my simple cute kitchen  i also got a little creative to make it work for me   i purchased two   combined them  and left a few shelves off   voila   i got adjustable shelf heights to fit my coffee machine      it does wobble   but it comes with a few wall attachments that i didnt use  i screwed it all together pretty strongly  it takes some muscle   i also put some heavy bottles on the bottom to keep it more stable 
simple  minimal  and easy to assemble 
i love this product  fast shipping  super easy to assemble  plan on painting it all white to match my decor  but overall extremely happy with my purchase  will be buying others in the set to match 
convient and sturdy
i love this shelf  its just what i needed  i use it to display myself and my boyfriends fragrances  it was really simply and easy to put together  i barely used the directions  i purchased thus item for  22 10 so it was a great buy  i plan to buy another when the price drops back down 
easiest assembly ever  exactly as described 
exactly as described and the instructions said it would take about 15 minutes to put together only took me about 5 and no tools required  heavy enough to look nice but easy for me to move if needed  i also realized i dont have to use all the shelves should i ever want to make it shorter you can just easily take one down and re apply the end caps  the only thing i wish was different was that the top end caps were wooden vs plastic to give it a more seamless look but buying the black it blends well 
great product
great stand for displaying my die cast cars  now this is made of pressboard and pvc pipe     but it looks like its wood  it does not look  cheap  by any means  this is in my  man cave  where eclectic is the operative word and this fits right in  one other thing  i don t know how they make a product this good for this amount of money  i mean this is really nice for the small sum it cost  its sturdy and i had no trouble putting it together      which is amazing because i have a terrible time putting anything together  five stars all the way 
does what i wanted and assembly was a snap
this was an incredibly wonderful purchase for what we needed  i just needed a shelf for a smaller sized bedroom to display collectibles  the fact that this requires no tools at all to put together is a huge plus  it took me all of 10 minutes to put it together and get it up  now  you get what you pay for  don t expect a well made wood shelf with strong bars  the bars are made of plastic and the  wood  is particle board  the finish looks decent but you can tell it is cheap  despite all of that  it is exactly what i expected and what was advertised so there are no surprises here  it is a little wobbly  but sturdy enough to put fairly heavy collectibles on it without a problem  it looks nice  especially from a distance you can t tell the bars are made of plastic  the purchased the light cherry black set and it looks very nice  for the price  this is an outstanding find  one additional thing i like about this is even though i purchased the four tier shelf  you don t have to use all four shelfs if it doesn t work for you  you can stop at whatever level works and put the caps on the top at that point  we almost stopped at 3 shelfs  but decided to use all four  i liked this so much  i bought another last night for a different room  if you have limited space or budget and need something that is easy to put together  looks good and does what it is supposed to   this is a great purchase 
great shelf for the price
i purchased this to put my sewing fabric on and its perfect  the unit isnt that tall which works great for me  im 5 feet and it is about a foot shorter than me  easy to put together  true to picture  only warning would be that each shelf is only meant to hold 15 lbs 
they re very nice considering the price 
the shelves are thin and the legs are plastic  that being said it s surprisingly sturdy and fairly attractive  i bought two and both went together quickly  stand straight and neither have had any issues with tipping  if you do have issues with tipping they include a little wall mount kit with each shelf so you don t need to worry 
great for toy storage 
this shelf is a little smaller than expected  only because i didnt read the full descriptionwhoops    but its perfect  it fits my needs better than expected  it looks really nice despite the low price tag  its not too wobbly either  perfect for organizing toys in the living room  and it was so easy to assemble  it took all of 5 minutes to set it up and 30 seconds to put things on it in an organized manner 
insanely easy to put together
insanely easy to put together  did it by myself  sitting in a chair  in about 5 minutes  15 minutes total from opening the box to putting the shelf in place  the rods are plastic  but that didn t bother me  feels very sturdy  one shelf came with a bent cracked corner due to shipping  i just put that one on the bottom and put that corner toward the wall  can t even tell 
small  sleek  great for nyc apartment 
exactly what i needed for my nyc apartment   this is slim enough to fit in my shoebox apartment  but big enough to hold all my items   easy assembly   no tools required  took me ten minutes  it is a little wobbly  but not enough to keep me from putting my wine rack on the top shelf  it also comes with a plastic tie if you wanted to secure it to something more stable 
nice shelf for simple storage
i wouldn t use this as a bookshelf or media shelf  kind of cheap and tacky for that but it s great for storing things in a closet or basement maybe  super easy to put together  took me less than 5 mins 
great for the price
this is cheap furniture  so don t expect anything fancy  but for what i paid for it   32   i m pleased  the shelves are press board  with the veneer only on the top and sides  not the bottoms of the shelves  the poles are sturdy plastic  it could not possibly be easier to put this unit together  you literally just stack the pieces and screw in the poles  it probably took 2 minutes  the unit is very lightweight  so if you have children  you ll have to anchor it  like any bookcase storage shelf  and warn them not to climb it  we are using it to hold a ton of board games  and it s very practical for that purpose 
great organizer 
i got these to organize a closet in my home office  and they are perfect  i was a little worried that they wouldn t be strong enough for everything i wanted to put on them  but they are perfect  i have textbooks  printer paper  envelopes  writing tablets  industrial sized staplers and hole punches  and plastic containers with computer accessories on them  and they are holding up beautifully  not only that  there was more room on these than i thought there was going to be  it has organized the closet perfectly 
great organizer and space saver
this is an absolute most have  great organizer and space saver  looks really great in my room for my entertainment setup  it was a snap to put together  probably about 10 15mins and it was ready for use  very sturdy on thicj carpet  mine did arrive damaged  some of the shelf boards were damaged on the corners but that was the fault of ups  still  everything went together flawlessly  no warps or bends  brilliant product 
for the price and brand  i was skeptic 
in the past  furinno and i have not had good times together  recently i bought two different shelves by them   since i have become rather heavy in buying figurines and candles  needed displays    and have been pleasantly surprised both times  they truly have no need for screws or any tools and both of them arrived in perfect condition  box and product  theres no splitting wood  and they look more on the expensive end  honestly  especially the taller shelf i bought  it took maybe ten minutes to put both together  if that  really surprised at the good quality and maybe restored my faith in the brand here 
what great deal    
for the price  i think this is perfect  simple  stylish and seems to be sturdy so far 
terrific value no tools required but incredibly sturdy
these are a terrifc value they go togather with ease but they are very sturdy the way they fit togather is seemless and they dont need tools and they are even very visually appealing i will be buying more and i already bought 7 i am very happy with them
this was a perfect perchase since it is compact and does not take    
i had been looking for such a thing for our office so that will not take that much of space and could handle our macro wave  kettle  and coffe maker on it  also  all the cups and tea bags and all other stuff that we could share in the office  this was a perfect perchase since it is compact and does not take a lot of place   which is the winning point specialy of you have a small place   also the color was perfect and was matching other furniture in the office  black   the material is good  it is strong enough to handle all the things that i mentioned  easily  generally  it is perfect for the price 
    know what to expect for the price but i love these  they are exactly what i was looking    
i didnt know what to expect for the price but i love these  they are exactly what i was looking for to display my pop figures  super easy to put together and sturdier than i expected for the price  cant speak for the other colors but the darker look makes it look more expensive than they are  already ordered a second one and may be ordering more in the future 
perfect for my game systems 
i was redoing my gaming setup and i needed shelves that were expandable  unobtrusive  and easy to put together to put my game systems on  i figured i d take a risk on these because they were cheap and had good reviews  it was a synch putting them together and only took about 10 minutes to get them in the configuration i needed  the packaging was good and they weren t damaged in the mail  they re perfect for my needs and i highly recommend them if you re in need of a versatile shelving unit 
good value
this is definitely a good buy for the money  my only complaint is that it could be a little sturdier but for the price  i m not complaining  it also came a little scuffed up but i didn t buy it for it to look nice  i bought it for functionality 
i have two of these shelves 
i needed shelves that i could throw away if we ever moved and not feel guilty about it  i bought one then a few days later i bought another  we have one on each side of our tv for all the books that were in a closet and so that we didn t look like squatters with only 3 items of furniture  we do not have children to climb on the shelves to really test their durability but i really cant complain at all  we  it was really just me but i am blaming my husband as well since he watched me do it  put the shelves together upside down but it worked out well since we just put the second together the same way 
great  holds a great deal of weight 
believe it or not    we bought two of these and it supports a 40 lb lizard cage  we wanted to maximize vertical space in our new home so we mounted the lizard on top of two of these tiered units  the cage is easily 2ft x 4 ft  we were then able to push our couch right up next to the tables so that the bottom of the cage is right behind the couch  we can then store miscellaneous items in the shelving and it is out of sight of our living room  also  our cats love to sit on top of the lizard cage because of the warm light which it emanates  often we have our two cats  weighing 20 lb total between them  plus the 40 lb lizard cage on two of these units  it shakes when the cats jump on and off of it but we have never been afraid of the cage falling or the shelving units breaking  perfect for our needs 
perfect   
i ordered this for the low price not knowing what to expect  and i was pleasantly surprised  i couldn t believe how easy it was to put together and how fast it could be done  this product is medium size perfect for a dorm room or a bedroom  it is a little shaky but it s great for the price 
simple assembly  remarkably sturdy 
these shelves are very easy to assemble  no tools requied  the shelves are attractive and are remarkably sturdy  considering that they are particle board  the instructions say that each shelf can hold 15 pounds  including the top shelf  for a total of 60 pounds  and that heavy items should be placed on the bottom shelf  a plastic cable and screw with anchor are included  in case you want to secure the shelves to the wall 
this is a great little bookcase
this is a great little bookcase  it s super easy to assemble  and holds the weight of full shelves of books perfectly well  i can t imagine it s the most stable bookcase as it s sitting on four posts  so if you have an animal or child who might knock or pull it down  you should probably go for a real bookcase  but for my uses  i have no issues 
for the price  definitely worth it  
this shelving unit met my needs perfectly  i am an artist  and have two tons of shhhhh everywhere of random art things i collect and projects unfinished  it holds up a lot of stuff  and even a ten pack of painting files on the top shelf hasn t broke it down  just bent it a lil  my girlfriend put it up quickly and easily  wish i could put two up   but the dimensions are too big for the spot i need it in  planning on painting it in the future  and i will update on that venture 
looks good  easy to assemble  durable  inexpensive
any time my teenage grandson s room starts looking cluttered  i buy him another one of these shelves  it always inspires him to do a super clean and rearrange his stuff  this is my fifth shelf from this manufacturer and they all were easy to assemble  look good  and are holding up well with use  this one came undamaged with all necessary pieces and my grandson had it together in about four minutes 
nice storage shelves
i m using this for my daughter s play nook in the living room  it s not heavy duty and she s old enough to not pull furniture on herself  otherwise  i wouldn t use this with small children  i ve purchased similar bookshelves in the past and these are a decent quality for the price  it took five minutes to assemble   no directions needed  this would be great to use in a walk in closet or a craft room as well 
it s a great height  i use it to store paints and    
i think i was able to put it together before the delivery guy pulled off  it s a great height  i use it to store paints and paint brushes and other party stuff  it s the perfect size for a small space or if you are looking for storage that doesn t take up the entire room  and bonus it great looking  i could use it as a regular fixture in my kids room or for other areas in my home  awesome price and great value 
five bucks per shelf  good deal 
nice basic shelving for an inexpensive price  won t hold your heaviest car parts but books should be fine  your wrists and forearms will get a workout twisting this thing together  can t beat it for  20 
perfect
i absolutely love this shelf  i have my tv on the top shelf  my xbox on the 2nd shelf  a small picture printer amd a can of change on the 3rd and some notebooks on the bottom and it works perfectly  it s strong enough to hold all of this  especially the tv  and is quite sturdy  if you have a kid that s learning how to walk or hyper dogs or something i wouldn t recommend it because a large amount of tugging or pushing will knock it over  but it s very nice  it also only took me like 5 minutes to put together  which was great 
this is one of the most efficient and easy pieces of furniture i ve ever received
this is one of the most efficient and easy pieces of furniture i ve ever received  the pillars twist into each shelf and it can be put together in 10 minutes or less  it is wonderful for the price you pay  the wood is mdf  with a coating of the style wood choice  i bumped one of my corners and it peeled off  but it is no issue for me  it is not noticeable  it is great for apartment living  makes a nice display for dcor  and is very space saving  it is much taller than i thought  excellent buy  i will definitely be investing in more furinno furniture soon 
best buy ever     mom on a budget    
im a scentsy consultant and im a single mother on a budget so this worked perfectly for my scentsy office and make sure to buy the matching pieces that amazon recommends because i did that as well and it all worked out so wonderfully for me  oh and did i mention the set up is a piece of cake and i am aweful at putting anything together  great buy     
fits nicely in the space  holds books well  slight cosmetic blemishes  otherwise  easy to assemble and use 
this unit goes together fairly easily  without tools  and though it had some slight cosmetic blemishes  lightly visible  cracks  on some of the side laminate  nothing to return it for  it fit well in the space  and held the books well  one note  this is not  repeat  not  a heavy duty shelf  so it will have that limitation  i e   for how much weight it takes   otherwise  a nice finish  i m trying to contact the manufacturer to see if they sell an extra shelf and legs  if so  great  if not  not a problem  also came with an  eye  hook  and other little bits  to secure to a wall   but i ve balanced out what i put on it  so it shouldn t fall over  nice of them to included it though  good light duty shelving 
they do the job
these worked out fine for me  i needed something light weight and easy to assemble to organize a small attic with only a pull down ladder for access and these did the job  for those who are wondering  yes you can combine these units to create taller shelves but just know that the bottom of each shelf is unfinished  they also come with attachable anchors to secure them to the wall so they won t tip over  i m not using them for decor but if you re on a really tight budget i think these would help you furnish a home economically 
fine 4 shelf units  ok as 7 shelf unit 
i bought two of these 4 shelf units  to assemble together as a taller 7 shelf unit  plus a spare shelf   some parts   configured this way  the whole unit is a bit wobbly  in fairness  it was designed to be a 4 shelf unit   but it s acceptable for my needs  it does have a bit of a  dark feel  because the vertical supports are black  i might spend time time painting them  probably multiple light colors  to lighten the mood in that corner of the room 
great organizer 
pleased with the shelves  took 5min to put together  has 4 shelves and can be used for so many purposes  i bought it to store extra snacks since my kitchen has a small pantry  perfect and color true to ad 
nice inexpensive storage solution
i needed to add some storage to a room  and i was drawn in by this because of the low price and the description of an easy tool free construction  with that in mind  i m pretty darn happy with it  it does literally take about 5 minutes to put together  maybe 10 if you want to be extra vigilant  and the process is so simple that you will hardly need the included   3 step  instruction manual  the shelves are sturdy enough to hold up to a surprising amount of weight without issue  it s not just a  display  shelf  you can use it for actual storage  it s obviously not as stiff as something with full wooden construction  so it does have a tiny bit of wobble to it if you bump it accidentally  however  i will say that i m constantly accidentally knocking it with my computer chair  and the amount of  wobble  that takes place isn t even enough to knock down the little funko pops and other figures that i keep on the top shelf  i m not at all worried about it tipping or falling over  although it probably helps that i have heavy stacks of books on the bottom shelf  in any case  i wouldn t hesitate to buy another one of these in the future  you can adjust the height by adding removing shelves  so if you bought two of these for example  you can build a 5 shelf unit and a 3 shelf unit  instead of two 4 shelf units  without needing any extra parts  it came pretty safely packed  there was a tiny scratch on the top of one of my shelves  but i might have done that myself when removing the pieces from the box  it s a good option for college students like me  cheap and easy to move  but also for anyone who would like quick and cheap storage that doesn t necessarily have cheap looks or performance 
sturdy  and easy to assemble
these are attractive  functional  sturdy  and easy to assemble  you can add as many tiers as you want  within reason  lol  if you purchase more  i got the grey with black poles  i ve bought like 8 of them now  i m really surprised with the aesthetic for such a cheap shelf  fit all my books  movies  games  etc  the shelves fit vinyl records perfectly as well 
worth the price 
i needed a shelf to display my action figures and this one works well  it s pretty sturdy my figures never fall down from anyone walking by or anything  i added led stick lights to the top of the middle shelves for added lighting  this shelf is very easy to put together  no need for tools  you just twist the legs into the shelf very easy takes like 10 min  for the price i would definitely buy again  i recommend this product 
looks surprisingly good  better than the picture imo
looks surprisingly good  better than the picture imo  easy to install  no need for tools  bottom of wood is not laminated so if this bothers you  don t get this  i use for storage room so i don t care so much how it looks  it s also really short but meets my needs  going to order one more 
great product  
great price for a great product  this was very very easy to set up and so far i ve had no issues with it  i ve had this up for about two weeks and i keep all of my hair related products on it  it matched perfectly with the furniture i already had as well  i got the dark wood  
storage problem answered 
exactly what i needed  i bought 2 for my apartment that lacked storage  easy to assemble  you literally just screw in all the legs  add a shelf  repeat   the plastic legs made me doubt the durability  but so far i have no complaints  one of the pictures is taken in my coat closet so you can see how compact it is
