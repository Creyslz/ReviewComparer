wonderful machine
the new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back 
great computer 
love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop 
good computer
most excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system 
five stars
ok
looks good
just opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problems
five stars
great deal  
love this product
i just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever bought
