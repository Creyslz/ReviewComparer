decent  but not the best
i m not quite sure how i feel about these headphones  when i received them  my impression was quite good  the packaging was done well  they arrived quickly  and the headphones  and all the accessories that came with it  were within this cute little black and red hard carrying case  the instructions were also in there  and if you read them it s quite easy to pair the headphones with your device  for the purposes of this review  i tested them with both my laptop and my phone  pros one of the good things about these headphones is the sound quality for the price  i thought they were pretty decent  definitely a more bass heavy product  but the sound came out clear  without much static   there was slight noise cancelling from the suction of the earbuds  which is always a plus  in addition  the length of the wire connecting the two earbuds was a good length  the calling functions worked quite well  and the earbuds did stay in my ears  that last one surprised me a bit  because my past experience with this kind of earbud has been that they fall out  the headphones lasted 8hrs on their first charge for me  which was as advertised in the product description  cons the first thing i docked a star for was the sound  the sound quality was good  however  i encountered two other issues  for some reason or another  when i would increase the volume to test how loud how soft the headphones go  the jump between volume levels at one point was  drastic   one volume level was too low and the other was  much  too loud  also  it did not help that the sound in the left ear was significantly louder than the sound coming out of the right ear  the right ear s volume was like a whisper compared to the clear  deep notes in the left  which made my experience with this product suffer  the second thing that i docked a star for was comfort  one of the things influencing this decision was the earbuds themselves  while they did stay in my ears  i tested to see how comfortable they would be to wear for extended periods of time  i  personally  found they got almost itchy  and started to feel a bit hard in my ears after around the 1hr mark  at which point i likely would ve taken them off  secondly  the magnetism between the earbuds wasn t that strong  it was enough that they came together  but they were easily separated  and if some of my hair got between the wire and my neck  they would not stay clipped together at all  for the price  these headphones aren t bad  as i said above  the sound quality is quite good  and i think some people would enjoy these as exercise headphones  however  i don t think this would necessarily be the first pair i would recommend 
i bought some really nice and expensive headphones with noise cancelling that are amazing
i bought some really nice and expensive headphones with noise cancelling that are amazing  i was using them with my big zero turn mower and could barely hear the mower running when listening to music  however  it is starting to get hot and dusty and i didn t want to ruin them  so i thought i would give these a shot  the good  in my opinion  these had excellent sound  the bass sounded great and they are very light and easy to pair and use  overall  i really like these  they were comfortable for wear for about 2 hours  the bad  i could not tell there was any noise cancelling going on  i had to crank the sound all the way up just to hear the music over my mower  they are not ideal for noisy environments and i think an old school pair of earbuds that go further into the ear would cancel out sound much better
