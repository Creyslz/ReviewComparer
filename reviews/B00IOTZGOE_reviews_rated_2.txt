slow
this computer is so slow it s almost unusable  it also doesn t have speakers built in 
tried everything to get wifi to operate on this computer    
tried everything to get wifi to operate on this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it 
bad purchase 
i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me 
the computer was nothing like the one advertised
the computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all  but is in good condition  just sad once again that it wasn t the computer in the picture i seen  oh well
    expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality

windows keeps giving a warning that software not certified
disappointed
not at all what i expected in a refurbished computer  non stop error messages  very slow  and getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new 
it works fine for now  but          
the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do 
disapointed
i ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00
