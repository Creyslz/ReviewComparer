missing screw  shoddy wall anchors  and scratched
it was missing a screw  luckily i had extra  the wall anchors had no  bite  and they had no edge bevel  so i had to use some extra i had laying around  one of the shelves were scratched  but not very bad  if it wasn t such a pain to put together  i would have returned it  it is a lego display shelf in my kids room  if i had it in a main room  it would have been unacceptable and returned  oh  and the instructions were miserable  they didn t bother saying what size drill bit you need for the wall anchor  maybe they figured you d replace them anyhow because of how poor the quality of the original anchors are  do yourself a favor and do use different anchors
you get what you pay for   but this isn t worth that 
so     i mean you get what you pay for  lesson learned but this might not even be worth that  putting it together wasn t so difficult but when you do  and you get it up the corner you want to put it in  you ll find that it doesn t lay flat on the corner walls which means when you screw in the 3 spaces it has for you to put it to the wall  it s sits off the wall in places which i forgot to get a picture of  the plastic pieces that go over the nail are a complete joke  some were broken when they arrived so we only used a few  it s cheap  if you are on a budge and don t have a lot of heavy trinkets to put up  it s okay  i wouldn t buy it again  it does not seem sturdy what so ever  i kinda wish i sent it back and just saved my money to get a really sturdy one 
count the screws before you build it 
make sure to count the number of screws before counting   we were building our shelf and realized that there weren t enough screws in the box  we looked veeeery carefully  and there were def not enough  unfortunately  we had already build half the shelf and didn t want to disassemble the whole thing just to get a refund  we ended up having to go to home depot to buy more screws because there weren t enough screws to put together the shelf  super annoying  
its too small and like another reviewer said
its too small and like another reviewer said  walls are not all straight  your walls have to be a perfect 90 degrees for this to look right  the space between shelves was small and the width was small  i ended up selling this on a garage sale site but pretty much recouped my costs  i had over 50 ppl interested in it  i think because of the added space  it seems like a great idea but its poorly designed and didn t work for us 
need to improve qc and kitting
the product looks just as described but the manufacturer needs to improve its qc and packaging team  while the product came with the right amount of shelves  it did not contain the right configuration parts  i e  instead of coming with 3x c  1xb and 2xa it came with 1x a and 5x c  which meant that you can t just install the shelves per the instructions  review is so low because of this issue  i was able to engineer the parts to work but it should be addressed  also  the caps for the screws fit too loose and fall off if you don t find a way to adhere them 
it looks nice when finished
it looks nice when finished  but it s a pain to put together  the instructions were pretty unclear  but with common sense it isn t difficult to construct  i was personally annoyed by the dry wall anchors  which were very cheap and ineffective  i they all came out of my wall  and i had to use my own anchors instead of the ones provided  i am disappointed with the construction process of this product  but the finished product itself isn t terrible  although the quality could be better 
it fell off the wall
though it was easy to install  after 2 months hanging on the wall it fell  in the middle of the night   everything i had on it broke and so did the shelving unit  it was great while it lasted but overall terrible quality 
like the look but doesn t fit right into corner
tried to install in my daughters room and it could very likely be the walls   but difficult to fit into the corner will have to rig it  and the drywall screws popped right out  completely inefficient  waiting to install the other one  do houses ever come with right angles any more 
horrible instructions made it nearly impossible to assemble
the instructions were a joke  parts were unlabeled and the directions might as well have been in a foreign language with how little sense they made  it took me wayyy too long to put together  the only positive thing i can say is that it looks exactly as advertised and is pretty
