this is a very good umbrella and opens closes seamlessly
this is a very good umbrella and opens closes seamlessly  pros    solid quality build   opens and closes easily   size is compact yet arc is large areas of improvement    expensive umbrella   comes with a leather holder but i have not found a use for this since there is another holder   bodyguard label on the velcro strap   i do not want to market for the company bottom line  if you are willing to spend   20 on an umbrella  this is a solid choice  it is well built  compact  and offers a wide arc for coverage  there is a large  bodyguard  label on the velcro strap though 
bodyguard travel umbrella lives up to its name 
i know why this umbrella is called the bodyguard  this umbrella has some heft to it  do not confuse it with the normal lightweight umbrellas on the market  this is a beast  it does everything an umbrella should do  but better  the one button open and close feature is great  i have arthritis  and this is very easy to use  i don t have to fight with it to get it to close and because of the teflon coating  it repels moisture and dries quickly  like i said before  this umbrella is heavier than the normal umbrella  but will still fit in your bag or purse  i am keeping my umbrella in the console of my car  stores easily and the leather pouch keeps the umbrella neatly tucked away  great purchase  spring is just around the corner  and this will last 
opens fully with button push  but only closes at the top
i ordered this umbrella because i was tired of cheap ones tearing up  and this umbrella does seem to be more sturdily built than others i have used  i like the way it opens up with the push of a button  when i first got it  i thought it was defective  because i could not make it close by pushing the button  then i found that i was not pushing hard enough  it does take a very firm push of the button to close it  and the only reason i am not rating it 5 stars is that i felt the description implied that it closes all the way with the push of a button  whereas only the top closes  and then you do have to manually push it back down into the handle area 
what wind 
its light  good size  easy open close  was able to use the other day during a windy storm here in nyc and it withstood the rain  of course when its raining hard coupled with 25 mph wind theres no guarantee you will stay dry  one downside    its too expensive  wish it was cheaper so i can buy another one for hubs 
well made  easy to use but larger and heavier than expected
this is really too long and heavy to be considered a true travel umbrella  but it is very sturdy and easy to open and close  love the case to keep the other things in your bag from getting wet and even though it is too large for my purse  i am taking it to london with me anyway
