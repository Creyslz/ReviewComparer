not a good fit for s5
i bought this kit to replace the screen protector that was put on in store when i bought my phone a few years ago  placing the screen protector was fairly easy  unfortunately  i ve found this protector to be a poor replacement  the protector is larger than the phone s glass  so even when placed perfectly centered it hangs off the sides trapping dust and lint  there is no cut out for the led indicator light or the space below the home button so those trap dust too  while the main screen looks beautiful  after several weeks of use the edges of my phone look horrible  i recommend customers look for a screen protector that is correctly fit to the size and contours of the s5 screen
