ridges in the plastic sleeves rub grind off easily 
i ve used metal shelves like this from other brands such as alera  whitmor  seville and they all work great  and basically in the exact same way   when i saw these metal shelves by amazonbasics at a cheaper price and with such great reviews  i figured it was worth a shot  dude   these suck  with just a little pressure  shelf just slides down the pole  after checking everything and taking it apart i saw that the plastic ridges in the sleeves had totally rubbed off  so i got another pair  and again  with the slightest pressure  the shelf just slid down  the same thing happened  the ridges in the plastic sleeves had totally rubbed off  this happened on 4 sets of the plastic sleeves  i m guessing they used some cheap  less durable plastic  if you look at the 2nd picture  you can see that the plastic ridges that are supposed to catch onto the metal pole are basically gone  there s no way these would support 250 pounds per shelf  maybe i just got a dud batch of plastic sleeves 
cheaply made    bad product    frustrating customer service    
the product is poorly made  and poorly packaged  the welds are thin and hastily done  the wires are set so far apart you have to put a liner on them to keep things from falling through  i m sure it cannot hold the claimed weight  i ordered several units  there was obvious damage to most due to thin insufficient packaging  only one shelf was damaged beyond useability  i sent a complaint asking for a single shelf to be sent to complete the unit  they sent a whole shelving unit and charged my card yet again  if i could have viewed the item in person i would have never purchased such crap  it would be easier to take these whole to the dump than to break them down to return them  i recommend not buying these 
several shelves arrived bent
it s nice and cheap but also cheaply constructed  several of the shelves and beams were bent on arrival  they don t hold a lot of weight without sagging either  i would not purchase this again  wish i could give this more stars    too bad i can t return this or get a refund 
poor design  i got a real one at the    
the plastic brackets that are supposed to hold up the shelves do not fit   poor design  i got a real one at the container store  one piece  foldable  is there no quality control at amazon    just sell anything 
this item would be great if the clasps fit
this item would be great if the clasps fit  they are way too small to fit around these poles  this shelf is useless without the clasps and i cant build it 
buy something else 
i bought it because it s supposed to be a heavy duty shelf for my garage  but the little cheap plastic pieces that hold up the shelves don t even fit together properly  theres no way this will hold anything heavy 
warning new version is made very cheep   
amazon went cheep  i purchased one of these shelves in june 2017  that one is great  bought another one  nov 2017  and it s terrible    super cheep feet  one of the top plugs is smashed  the screw in adjustment feet on the bottom are cheep plastic  one shelf is warped so almost impossible to assemble  and the list goes on  seriously  seems amazon changed vendors to supply these shelves so now the construction and quality control is very poor 
not so great 
1st order  i bought two for my garrage  they look exactly how i expected  very sturdy  easy to assemble  good value of money  2nd order  so i liked my first pair so ordered second one  one of two was losely packed and had some scratches  the stands are not sturdy and legs are not aligning  shelves looks bent too 
very disappointed with this product
some of the parts don t screw well together  one foot screw was too thick for the all bottom poles  i had to remove all the foot screw so they ll be level  the plastic sleeves do not connect around the pole either  very disappointed with this product  i should have just gone to target and bought a similar product  also  it s too much a hassle to return so to the trash it goes 
they do not send you the item in photo 
they use stock photos and do not send you the actual item in the photo   also the description says the rack is 36 wide  it is only 33   this shelf is very small  i was expecting something much larger based on the review photos  i really feel scammed right now 
not worth the money 
i wasn t very impressed with this product at all  i thought i could save some money by buying this cheap version of a metal shelving unit  i needed it when i bought it or otherwise i would of returned it  it came rusted in the corners and the  silver coating  flaking all over  doesn t come with wheels like larger versions
