waste of money
i bought this computer months ago and now the computer will not even turn on  i powered down the computer and now the power light is blinking but the computer is not turning on  when i did use the computer it was extremely slow and very loud    i ve only had this computer maybe 6 months and i already have to trash it because it s useless now  never buying from this seller again 
very disappointed as this was for my kids for their school    
started once  now won t start up  just gives roundabout messages how it can t start and the auto fixer can t fix  very disappointed as this was for my kids for their school work 
dont waste your money
i ve had nothing but problems with it from day one  but i m sure that s why it was so cheap  my recommendation  just fork out the extra money and buy a new one
doesn t work
the price was too good to be true but i was reassured that it was certified refurbished  anyway cords was not a great fit and monitor went out after two hours of rigging the cord to work  i should ve kept the box to ship back 
any way i got my computer  not as expected had delays   days later and open it up its dirty and got some scuff marks all around it never
