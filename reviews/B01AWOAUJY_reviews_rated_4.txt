runs mint
good performance for the price 
for more money there are certainly better systems  but for the basics  this is great  had to replace the memory after 3 months  still not a bad deal  but down to 4 stars 
 
the machine appears and operates as if new and is very fast  my only complaint would be that it seemed plagued by a number of outdated drivers  although i had to employ a third party vendor to correct this deficiency  the cost was nominal  and overall i am very pleased with the purchase and consider it a wise investment 
had to purchase a new key board as my old    
had to purchase a new key board as my old one had an out dated connection end  no big deal as key boards are really cheap

the windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set up
it is a fast running computer  the windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set up  the start up is the same as any other windows version computer  i bought mine for an excellent price around  95 and it is worth every bit of it  i have had it for two months and use it everyday to do basic computer work and some school studies  it is wifi compatible but they send an antenna with it to pick up the wifi service and the wifi does not work on this device without out it  also there is no bluetooth  so you also have to buy separately a bluetooth transmitter  the wifi antenna they sent with it stopped working with this after a week and i made dozens of calls to local computer servicing businesses and they did not know why so i spent  15 to buy a new one which was very aggravating  also the windows office products do not come with this device so you have to purchase them separately for like  99  it has numerous little bugs and fixes but just for an at home pc to do some work on it works fine  not highly recommended otherwise  my best advise is to do your research and find out exactly what you need and are looking for    don t go wrong with a machine like this cause it can just become a money drain like it has for me  
fan is loud  gets hot
gets really hot and fan becomes very loud  not on floor or against surfaces blocking vents  works well otherwise 
four stars
the sound quality is not so good
four stars
perhaps it is my internet connection  but sometimes slow
