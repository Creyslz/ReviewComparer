can t beat the price  runs great
arrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it 
not perfect but   
the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then 
system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    
system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectly
perfect purchase
have had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one 
cool but  
so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice tho
good value 
a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it 
dell computers
the whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great 
good value for the money
huge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money 
the computer came in good condition and also work great
the computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints 
four stars
very nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifi
nice 
very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable

broken keyboard when opened
keyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in august
it works like new
bought as a gift  grandkids love it 
good buy for the price   
i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping 
decent computer for a good price 
sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    
great computer 
i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles 
    no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    
for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lol
good computer but keyboard damaged
all in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off 
it was easy to set up
i was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it 
can t beat the price for the product you re getting 
i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill

nice unit i bought  2  of these 
plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    
everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly 
good deal  works just fine

very good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  
well worth the money 
they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service 
works fine  the only thing i had to do was

well worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade

quick delivery great computer
worth the money  but not quite good as new
if i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money

very happy  only thing is speakers are scratchy  sound  and the stand broke early on 
no sound drive
had trouble installing my printer  no up dated drive  monitor is good but a older model  very heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with 
the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce 
the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs 
i received what i was hoping for 
i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way 
overall happy with it
the computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall happy with it
