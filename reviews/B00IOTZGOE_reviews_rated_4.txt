can t beat the price  runs great
arrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it 
not perfect but   
the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then 
so far so good
so far after a week working well  arrived exteamly fast  i will say the tower cover was very scratched up and something is broke off in the front ear phone port do unable to use it  but so far so good  so 4 stars hopefully that wont change
system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    
system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectly
perfect purchase
have had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one 
cool but  
so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice tho
good value 
a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it 
dell computers
the whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great 
good value for the money
huge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money 
the computer came in good condition and also work great
the computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints 
four stars
very nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifi

good buy for the price   
i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping 
decent computer for a good price 
sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    
great computer 
i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles
