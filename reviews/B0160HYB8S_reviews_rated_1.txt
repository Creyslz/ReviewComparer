not at all windproof 
got this umbrella because i was looking for something that was light yet versatile  i am specifically leaving this review because the manufacturer s claim that it is  wind defying 9 rib construction      with 9 resin reinforced fiberglass ribs that flex slightly to withstand powerful gusts without turning inside out  is simply not true  after 2 months of repeated use  i have experienced several times when a small gust  less than 10 mph  causes this umbrella to invert  the product description specifically says it  withstands powerful gusts without turning inside out   but as i said  this is unequivocally not true  the tiniest sudden gust will cause it to turn inside out  and while the ribs do not snap  you can still collapse the umbrella to be put back in its case after it inverts  thus  i want other potential buys to know this is not windproof at all  the umbrella will invert  several times if it is windy  further  if you are truly looking for a windproof umbrella  i d say look elsewhere since the claims made with this umbrella are not true 
chicago bested this umbrella
update on this umbrella  it has not held up well at all  it seemed too light weight to be made well and indeed it wasn t  one strong chicago wind bent the arms and tore the fabric  a lot of other people seemed to like theirs  so maybe i got a bad one  either way  i tried something new and it didn t workout  if the company is reading this review  maybe i got a defective one  or maybe wind test your products in chicago  i won t bad mouth you as most people seemed happy  but mine was not a good experience 
virtually indestructible     
in theory  it should resist to strong winds  storms  tornadoes    but actually it got broken on 3rd use  simply opening it 
really wanted a few really good umbrellas for the storms we ve been getting    
i bought 4 different colors  black  the one one with the clear blue sky on the inside  yellow  and pink  a rib on the clear blue sky one broke on the 2nd use  the yellow one was always hard to collapse to begin with  and on the 3rd use  after putting up a little fight  something broke and no longer opens nor collapse  hopefully the remaining 2 will last longer than these two 
so sad  it bent in moderate wind    
i bought this once  and it wouldn t collapse  i gave a new one a shot and it bent on moderate wind in nashville  it was not a storm  just a wind gust 
i ve only used it like 6 times
i bought this umbrella because it was highly rated about a month ago  i ve only used it like 6 times  pretty much the first time i started using it  the umbrella sleeve stitching started coming loose  only a matter of time before it s no longer useful  just today the end cap of the umbrella came off  so  i d have to say  skip this model  at this rate it s won t work in a few more months 
not built to last
i plunked down my money on this  wind proof  umbrella because a trusted review site recommended it  the wind has its way with this umbrella left and right  all too often turning it out  annoying as that is  and for a wind proof umbrella it s quite annoying  it finally  on a recent bout of 10 mile an hour wind  started to come undone  had it two months and i m well outside my return window  still has life left in it  but since its begun its downward slope  methinks entropy will quicken  such disappoint 
do not recommend and false advertisement
do not believe the reviews  i took this umbrella to paris  france and it did not survive the weather there  it was windy one day  and the umbrella turned inside out and eventually broke one of the metal pieces  do not recommend and false advertisement 
    all of the reviews and everyone seem to be happy but i am in new york city right now    
i read all of the reviews and everyone appears to be happy woth this thing but i am in new york city right now and it is raining  i used it for 45 minutes  closed it and then opened it up again five minutes later and it wouldnt stay open  a string was sticking out from the top and it no longer works  very very disappointed  it worked well for 45 minutes so if you only need an umbrella for 45 minutes  this is the one to buy  junk
i ve had two umbrellas  each for about a month    
i ve had two umbrellas  each for about a month  on both  the spring that opens and shuts the umbrella broke  so both now will not stay open
