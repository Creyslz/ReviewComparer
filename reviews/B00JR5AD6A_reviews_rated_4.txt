worth your money  reliable brand  powerful motor   best for milk shakes
i was looking for some lightweight blender which can chop onions  make salsa and milk shakes  this blender is one of the cheapest ones yet have all sort of fancy attachments  looks good and have a powerful  650  watt motor  negative   only one single speed option and pulse  there could be at least one more option for speed may be at half speed   travel cup to go flask s lid is not convenient to drink  it is practically of no use and i rather drink it straight out of the 16oz cup    no more usage and washing of other cups glasses      really small capacity  but in this price with so many attachments  it has to be small   plastic container looks like cheaply made and seems like it may break easily  however mine is working fine so far   i don t like the orientation design of blades  only two levels  one of the bottom blade could be fixed at centre  i ve seen so in some other blenders  there is considerable gap and can leave small pieces untouched  i wish in listing they would have uploaded the picture of blades  never mind i am attaching in my review for all other buyers     lid for 32oz jar is not tight enough  it just fits it but not like air tight or spill free  positive   powerful motor 650 watt motor  peak speed   one single option for speed which is top speed   probably most powerful in this price segment   several fancy attachments   although orientation of blades is not good but motor is powerful enough to move the most of the content   lightweight  yet powerful   absolutely perfect for shakes   for anything else it does the job but not good enough   priced right   cheap for number of attachments provided   little bit of quality compromised in plastic but still good enough  bpa free plastic jars conclusion  if your primary purpose is making milk shakes  don t think twice  its the best deal  although the travel cup s cap is not designed to travel  the mouth have no lid and is kind of inconvenient to drink  cheap price  reliable brand  light weight            update on 17th december  after heavy use of 1 5 year  this blender gave up  used for milk shakes almost everyday  ps  if this review was helpful to you in anyway then please vote  yes helpful 
a great machine for all kinds of drinks  lots of power  small size  well integrated cups 
we love this machine  we wanted to get a second cup for a previous h b blender  but they were  8   this turned out to be so cheap i bought it instead   we paid about  22  it seems to have gone up since then  but look around for another listing on amazon   one of us is on a liquid diet  so it gets used several times a day  we are now drinking lots of fruit smoothies  likes  well integrated blending drinking cups  three sizes as shown in the pictures  plus a regular 32 oz  blender cup  overall small footprint on the counter  we keep it on the counter and never have to get out our full sized blender since 32 oz is plenty  many clever design touches  including the way the blade goes on the open end for mixing  then comes off for drinking  it comes with 2 large  sippy cup  lids  plus one lid that can be opened or closed for travel  very easy to remove from the blender briefly to add more ingredients or give it a shake  the containers seem to be a very sturdy plastic  no bpa  as long as you clean them immediately after use  a jet of warm water is enough although we use a bottle brush  lots of power  unlike its predecessor   400 watts i think  i would not run it for 2 minutes straight  but 45 seconds is no problem  plenty of power to chop frozen fruit or anything else   see below about full sized ice cubes   good design of the switch  you can easily blip it for a few seconds  or turn it on and let it run  the parts assemble and disassemble very quickly  with no way to put them together wrong  except see below about the  coupling    flaws  the biggest problem is the high aspect ratio of the two big drinking cups   meaning  tall and thin   this makes them harder to clean   the bottom of the cup won t get clean in a dishwasher  i understand why they did it   the small diameter is needed to keep the  footprint  of the blender small  we bought a  4 bottle brush which is perfect for cleaning them and solves the problem  the small cup does not have this problem   they should provide two small and one large  instead of vice versa  the high aspect ratio also sometimes leads to poor circulation between the top and bottom when blending  be sure to leave a one inch bubble inside  so you can remove it and give it a quick shake  when we first got it  we sometimes failed to push the cup down far enough on the base  the result was rapid erosion of the coupler between the blades and the base   details of the design are tedious   it makes sense once you see it   so far this has not caused any problem  minor safety flaw  the switch is very easy to trigger accidentally  there is no  completely off  setting other than unplugging  for the most part the design is very safe as the blades are completely inaccessible while it s mixing  however you can put the blades onto the base without any cup   there s no reason you would want to  but i did it once when we first got it   in that situation  it is dangerous since a momentary touch of the hair trigger switch will start the blades and shred anything they touch  like fingers  in short  i would have preferred a safety interlock that prevents the motor from running unless everything is in the right place  tips  use crushed ice  if you must use full sized cubes  take care that they don t jam the blades  order of ingredients matters  frozen ingredients go in the top  so when you blend they are on the bottom  keep the overall mixture liquid enough  for example  add milk in addition to yoghurt  i suspect with 90  greek yoghurt  it would never mix the top and the bottom  overall  we love it and use it constantly  as mentioned  i d like to give it 5 stars  but the tall aspect ratio requires several adjustments to deal with 
most of the reviews are on point  still a great blender 
been using it a while now  the blender is pretty powerful  but  if you hold it down for more than 2 3 seconds  there is a burning smell  if i fill it up to the top  i have to shake the ingredients between pulses  but with enough liquid  i use milk   i find i don t have too much of a problem  if you use yogurt  i found any more yogurt than 50 50 really taxed the motor 
great product
i love this blender  i use the blade for both the larger cup but also the individual bottles  i didn t realize it was only one speed  but i only use it for smoothies so i don t mind  it cleans easily  i ve left stuff in it for days before and it still cleans quickly and easily  i love it  and i thought it was a decent price 
great blender  just one small critique 
this blender set is great for the price  the motor is strong enough to shred through ice without skipping a beat  and the contents mixes throughout down to the blades no problem  the bottle containers easily transition from the blender attachment  screwed onto the top  to the bottle easily  by just screwing on the bottle attachment  the cheese grader works as expected  and can turn whole parmesan into shredded parmesan in a matter of seconds  i also use the blender to make frozen drinks  or for protein shakes if i am mixing more than one  my old blender  a ninja  would have this issue where the protein powder would get stuck to the sides and not actually mix into the drink  for whatever reason  perhaps the shape of the bottle or the size of the interior relative to the motor  this doesn t happen with my hamilton beach stay or go blender  pros  strong motor  easy to use and convenient attachments  easy to clean  multiple bottle containers make for convenient access  cons  only one speed  i personally don t mind though   with a  pulse  and an  on  setting  the tops for the drink containers do not have a valve to let air circulate into the bottle while you drink  creating a suction problem  i fixed this problem by drilling a tiny hole into the top with my smallest drill bit  and it now works 100  to satisfaction  though it would be nice if this was done by the manufacturer 
good but loud
the multiple sizes make this a great product  my only problem is it s loud like really loud  go far it has worked like a charm for blended coffee  fruit smoothie  cream soup  and homemade pasta sauce  very pleased
great for smoothies
best used for making smoothies  not really good to be used as a standard  blender  because it just is not strong enough  but as a smoothie maker i rate it 100   that was my purpose for buying this product to make smoothies  so all is good  i do recommend this product for smoothies and a great price  thank you
good blender
i waited a few months to review this blender  i really wanted to see how it did first  i have to say i m impressed  i make a lot of smoothies using ice and frozen fruits and it blends them well  the only thing is it will leave a little pulp or crushed seeds  for the price though compared to some very high end blenders its definitely worth it  i also love that it came with two large travel cups and one smaller with shaker lid  definitely recommend
worth a lot more than the price
ok for the price you might think it s a dud or a cheapie but no  buy it  i have been making smoothies and it blends through oats and ice and whole almost easily  today i made carrot ginger apple juice  all are very fibrous and it made easy change out of it  you will not be disappointed 
price is great  wish it would have came with closed lids    
price is great  wish it would have came with closed lids for taking the cups on the go  only comes with lids with open holes in them 
works very well so long as you don t have too    
works very well so long as you don t have too much in the well for the motor and blades to handle   then it can get a bit hot and you can definitely tell by the smell  the parts are a bit hard to clean  but being dishwasher safe definitely helps 
good buy for the price but won t blend ice on the first try
great with all the attachments but you ll rarely use the small shaker thing cause it s just too small  i use it to blend up fruit smoothies with ice and i constantly have to take it off the stand and shake it up by hand then put it back on  great buy for the price but you ll have to do some of the work yourself 
this is a good vendor for its price
this is a good vendor for its price  works well  unless you want to blend the ingredients very very finely  this will do the job  plus you can blend your shake directly into the mugs   glasses that come with the blender and it makes everything so much convenient 
powerful and easy to clean
powerful and easy to clean  4 stars because the tumblers aren t very easy to drink out of  and leak when closed 
i use it for blending frozen fruit
okay product i bought to make me shakes from frozen fruit and it works pretty good for the price 
great blender
this blender has been great so far  i use it to make protein shakes before i go to work in the morning and it is quick and blends everything perfectly  the only down side is the travel bottles don t close  there is just an opening for drinking or for a straw  but as long as you are not planning on sealing it up and drinking it later it works just fine 
flimsy but functional 
cheap plastic  the mixing jar is a bit flimsy  but it does what it is supposed to do  large blades are easy to clean 
it was great while it lasted
it was great while it lasted  we used this to make smoothies for breakfast almost every morning for 6 months until the motor died
