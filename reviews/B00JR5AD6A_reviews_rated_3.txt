i ve used it many times and still like it
it s compact which is nice  since i have very little counter space  but it can get a little noisy  so no late night smoothies  what made me choose this one was the individual sippy cups that blend right on the base  now i can make a single size smoothie  also clean up is pretty easy  but i had to buy a long bristled cleaner to get the crevices because i couldn t get my hands in there 
cheap bushings  
very powerful motor   just smaller than we thought  after 8 months it s leaking on bottom where the chopper is at   the ceramic washer fell apart an it s really loose   contacted seller an they said i had to go thru manufacture  i have a backup 1 that s a hamilton beach that s 10 yrs old an doesn t leak   the only reason we ordered new 1 is because it had a small tear on lid   don t buy this 1  
not very powerful
not a full sized blender  not very powerful either but it does the trick for smoothies  i feel like the motor is going to go out pretty quick though  wish i would have spent a little more and got something else but im making it work as long as i can 
lids don t close 
the blender is better than average for the price  ive had it for a year and it s still running strong   but the stupid cups it comes with don t have lids that close  they are permanently open  even the one with a twisty top  pictured ont he smallest cup in the image  is completely insecure  so don t even think about  go  ing anywhere with those   
good for smoothies without ice if you think ahead
it s ok i can do a few things i got it for but it seems to leek really easily and jams even on partially thawed frozen bananas
the travel cups are an absolute amazing bonus with this item however the blades suck and    
i bought this because i needed a blender  the travel cups are an absolute amazing bonus with this item however the blades suck and it really doesn t blend ice or things like the way i expected it too
