a disappointment   quit less than 15 minutes out of the box 
this was easily the weakest blender i ve ever used  my last blender died after years of use  this one arrived and looked promising  but died less than 15 minutes into being out of the box  as always amzon is great about returns  and the blender has been returned  b d has some great products  but this particular blender is definitely not among them  disappointed is an understatement  my next blender will be a different brand 
terrible blender  spend a few dollars more and get something that works properly
worst blender i ve ever purchased or used  the center plastic top doesn t stay steady and if you have hot liquids in the decanter  you will burn yourself  you have to put a dishrag or something on top to make sure your hands are protected  it s cheaply constructed  which makes sense given the price  but it doesn t even function properly 
by far the worst appliance i ve ever bought
by far the worst appliance i ve ever bought  it has difficulty getting anything blended  from ice cream to fruit 
one star
can t use it for smoothies because it can t crush ice  returning it
terrible rating for my terrible blender
this blender is absolutely trash  i wanted to have an eclectic blend of fruit smoothies  but ended up in disaster  the blades don t work  the blender is slow  it is loud  and i am upset  i want to take my business somewhere else  if you want to get a great blender  for a great price  do not purchase this 
lacks the blade
really frustrated  sending back and will not purchase again for this waste of my time 
first time i purchased from this brand and the experience was not the best  very disappointed
