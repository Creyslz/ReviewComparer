not ideal for design heavy workflows   but decent for office work
bought two of these to attach to my macbook pro and use as my primary monitors  for basic work  web browsing  video watching  and viewing editing documents  this monitor will do just fine and  for the price  is quite excellent  but if you are attempting to do any sort of design work  then skip over these  the pixel density on the screen is really poor and fine details are lost   lots of jaggies  text blending  blurred lines  and horrendous dithering  i m docking off the 2 stars because typically when you see a monitor highlight srgb coverage in its details section  they are trying to attract designers and design heavy users  that s why i purchased   definitely does not cut it for any design work  so don t bother picking it up for that  however  if you want to use it for office tasks  then i m sure you ll be more than happy with it  for general office work  great monitor  you ll love it  for design work  not adequate   keep looking 
speakers have very low volume
the monitor has a nice  clear picture and i like having the ability to swivel the screen  the reason i am rating only 3 stars is because i do not like the speakers  i bought this model specifically for the built in speakers  the volume is very low when turned up to the highest level  i have the volume turned up to the highest level on my laptop and the monitor  i have tried everything  if i walk away from the computer monitor i cannot hear anything  which defeats the whole purpose of me buying a model with built in speakers  i would return it but the box was thrown out by accident  so now if i want to hear my computer across the room etc   i have to disconnect the monitor and use the speaker on my laptop 
terrible speakers
very nice monitor and stand    sturdy  however  why do they even bother putting in substandard speakers if you cant hear them  also  no camera or mic  better to buy monitor and buy separate speakers  which i had to do 
colors are dull especially the white
looks ok  but the colors are really quite dull especially the white which looks much more like grey  it makes for an ok cheapish monitor  but if you are particular about the quality of color in your display i would keep searching
