common sense   maintenance 
it may be clich  but it seems common sense is uncommon  prior to purchasing my first nuti ninja as a family christmas gift last year i poured over the reviews of various products here on amazon and there seemed to be a common theme among the negative reviews  sanitation and leaks  after using my blender for the better part of 10 months i ve come to a conclusion   1 don t overfill  2 clean the seal  i m sure all of us at some point have been guilty of over filling a conventional blender and the result is material fit for a comedy  if you disintegrate a solid object into a billion pieces it s going to take up more space  the blender will become a pressure vessel   hydraulic forces will find a way out  don t over fill this or any blender for that matter  i suppose too if the base is cross threaded it won t form a proper seal  if you look at the reviews of all brands of blenders there is a common thread to all the negative comments  are all blenders poorly designed  not likely  it more plausible to me that a certain percentage of folks either ignore the directions or are in such a hurry they over fill the container  of course there is the possibility a individual product is defective but that s going to happen regardless of brand  the second big issue seemed to be cleanliness   sanitation  in my opinion not only is the seal removable on the ninja but it is absolutely imperative that you do so  no amount of soap and water is going to clean around the seal  once you see how it is constructed i m sure you ll agree  i guess they re fragile if you go digging it out with a buck knife but don t do that   use the correct tool  again this issue is not unique to the ninja but common with many blenders  the seal on the ninja is not an o ring or flat gasket style   it s a 8mm wide silicone 1mm thick pcompression seal and with a little care can be removed allowing for proper cleaning of the seal and its seat  and replacement seals are available if it does get damaged over time  i located scores of sellers online  once a week at a minimum i use a dental style pick tool to carefully lift the seal out for a thorough cleaning  once you pull that seal out and observe how it s made it all makes sense  so  don t put too much stuff in it and take 5 minutes a week to clean the seal and you ll be golden  now on to the good stuff  for a personal blender in a pregnant category where many sell for  200 00 to  400 00 this comes in at the low end of the price range but appears to have good quality control using the same materials as higher priced designs  the walls of the blending cups are thick as are the stainless blades  another feature i noticed was the where the motor drive mates with the blade cap  the latter is made of a softer material that absorbs shock rather than transmitting it thru the drive assembly reducing the chance of fractures  no it s not quiet by any stretch of the imagination but the vast majority of the noise seems to be produced by the blending process not the motor itself  i read a review by one poor soul who s unit belched sparks out the motor ventilation ports  needless to say an isolated issue  in summary  i ve used my ninja for 10 months on average 6 days pre week  i ve put every combination of foods in from ginger root to grapes   yogurt to yucca   cucumber to cranberries  peanuts to passion fruit and with the proper ratio of solid to liquid filled to the correct level i can honestly say i ve never had a problem   i ve concocted some nasty tasting mixtures i ll never do again but the ninja still looks   performs like new  i m a very skeptical customer and was in a quandary about which blender to buy  every brand was on the table  oster bruan vitamix jamba juice blendtec nutribullet and believe me i have no problem returning a sub par product but this little guy has given me no reason to say anything but good things  there s literally millions of these out there being used by every variety of person and the odds are some will have a bad experience  is the vast majority that love these   haven t had an issue wrong  or is it more likely the few that for whatever reason had a bad experience are upset and vocal  common sense tells you the answer  even rolex has its critics  one last thing  the 32oz cup is a handy addition to consider  i can easily make drinks for three in one shot   be done with it  i received nothing in return for my review  i am in no way associated with this product  i am a 56 year old retired truck driver  i highly recommend this product 
user friendly
this was worth every penny  and i feel like i got so much more for my money  having also owned other  significantly higher priced juicers and mixers  this one is more compact  looks good on the counter  is way easier to use and clean  and makes quick work of any ingredients you put in it  i love you just screw off the blade lid  rinse it  and then screw on the regular cap  and go  this is no sissy blade  either  go ahead  put whatever you want in it  and watch it grind it up with ease  i add nuts  seeds  frozen fruits and veggies  protein powder  and literally  within seconds  i have a fantastic drink to go  love the large and medium containers  so i can make enough for two days  if i want  love this machine  and i could have bought 12  yes 12  of them for what i paid for my other mixer  which now sits in the bottom counter  taking up space  because it s too large and bulky  and really hard to clean

well worth the money for a quality blender
i ve had this for a couple months now and absolutely love it  while it can be used as a blender for other things such as sauces  i use it exclusively for smoothies  anything i put into it   ice  frozen fruit  etc  take mere seconds to fully blend into a smoothie with no lumps or missed fruit chunks  i also love how it comes with two size cups   a 24oz cup i use when having a smoothie as a meal  and an 18oz cup i use if not that hungry  or making more of a dessert smoothie  the model i purchased  bl456  also comes with a  nutri ninja guide to nutritional goodness  that contains 75 recipes for various things such as smoothies  sauces  infused teas  soups  and juices  the book has a retail value of  19 99  personally  i wasn t terribly interested in it as i only use it for smoothies and many of the smoothie recipes called for ingredients i would never buy  but others may find it more useful  whoever also made the book also must really love almond milk because it seemed like all of the smoothie recipes called for it  and i hate almond milk  pros    heavy duty   takes mere seconds to fully blend anything i put in it   two cup sizes   easy to clean cons    didn t find the recipe book that came with it useful  though it may be useful for those who want it for more than just smoothies  and like almond milk    it s loud overall  well worth the money for a quality blender 
nutri ninja pro
this is actually my third nutri ninja pro    two different homes and my husband travels with one  he is diabetic and sometimes uses a protein drink as a meal or snack   it is not really  compact  exactly  but it travels easily enough  to be honest i also own a vitamix too  but this is the one i use almost daily  it crushes ice cubes in a few seconds to a smooth  creamy consistency  i mix frozen fruit or fresh fruit and it easily blends those  if you re looking to make smoothies and want it to be easy to clean and really efficient  this is the one  i never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful 
love this  quick and easy 
love this  i have used the magic bullet in past but motor and blades can t blend ice and cups are too small  the was using an immersion blender which makes a mess and sometimes powder is left on sides  this nutrininja professional is amazing  got on prime day  it s super quick and blends easily  i use it daily to blend frozen fruits  ice and vegan protein powder for protein shakes  no powder left on sides  no gritty feeling  super creamy    love the large cup  use it exclusively for my shakes  after blending  just put on lid and throw in my stainless steel straw and go  even recently bought my own beans and made my own coffee grounds  love how easy it is to take off the blade and how substantial the cups and lids are  want to buy a few more extra large cups  i love to take my shakes to go  would be nice to have more than one to make hubby a large shake 
best juicer blender
bought this to replace a nutri bullet   very weak motor  constant leaking  hard to open  this nutri ninja pro silver is super sturdy  lines up perfectly to the little notches in the base  so you know it s secure  and power      fantastic takes less time to blend and pulverize my fruit  fresh spinach  ground flaxseed  a dollop of yogurt  a tablespoon of honey and protein powder  this baby rocks      no regrets on this purchase     update  after three months of daily use  i must say this is by far the most superior design for a blender  look no further  this one does what it says  no leaks  no mess  and perfect every time  five stars   
i m eating healthier 
i love this ninja  reasonably priced  i m a picky eater  like a two year old  i hate most fruits and veggies  seriously  i like apple  orange  banana  grapes  lettuce  carrots  potatoes  tomatoes and that s about it  i mostly ate junk food and processed foods  and i m going on 45 and was over weight and tired all the time and i knew i had to eat better  so i bought the ninja  i buy frozen fruits and veggies  add vanilla yogurt and cranberry juice  ice and yummy i m eating healthy and i love it  i don t know why the smoothies taste good but cooked beggies are yucky to me  i ve lost weight and i m feeling great  i recommend trying  update  i bought this july 2016  its now jan 2018  i use my ninja every morning to make a smoothie for breakfast and drink on my way to work  i use twice on saturday and sunday for breakfast and lunch and it still works like i bought it yesterday  due to making fruit and vegetables smoothies everyday i ve been eating healthier and lost 25 lbs since i bought   i have not exercised  just diet changes  i love my ninja  the seller too as it came in two days as i m a prime member and the packaging was great  no damage 
but it is really super easy to use and practical for quick breakfast shakes
very much still learning about this product  but it is really super easy to use and practical for quick breakfast shakes  last night my hunny made salad with romaine  arugula  radish  scallion  evoo and a touch of sesame oil  half he put on a plate the other half went into the mixing cup a small amount of good chicken broth was added because of the need for liquid  and pulsed a few times  we both drank the end product  it was good and would be good for anyone who has trouble chewing or swallowing  like after dental procedures  etc  we will keep experimenting  you are most limited only by your imagination or lack of it 
lovely kitchen tool
i love a simple frozen banana and almond milk smoothie in the mornings  this blender is great for frozen bananas  you could definitely make banana nice cream  super easy to use and the cleanup is so nice  the only reason i need a blender now is for hot things  everything else goes in the bullet 
i liked the first one so much i bought a second    
i liked the first one so much i bought a second for the office  i am on a meal replacement plan that requires making a shake four times a day  this one is perfect  crushes ice and frozen fruit perfectly  works well every time  my only complaint is the lids are hard to get on  you have to be sure they are lined up perfectly before putting in on the base to blend  the will screw in slightly crooked and then will leak  often i have to put it on and off a few times to get it lined up just right  but a minor issue  still highly recommend 
a mighty blender in a mini package
i don t understand the complaint that it is  manual   it is so powerful that your pressure on the vessel is only for seconds to get a perfect smoothie or blended soup  i also own the larger ninja professional bl660 blender in another location and can attest to the fact that while this nutri ninja pro is less powerful  for it s compact size and single blade design it is still a winner  while you don t have the variability of the larger ninja s multi speed controls  imho a lot of that stuff is really overkill anyway  highly recommended for smaller venues or for single folks where the larger ninja is not appropriate 
one of my favorite products of all time
myself and my roommate used this blender every single day multiple times until we lost the base  i know  how does a person even do that   so i purchased this one and it s perfect  if multiple people use it  you might want to get a few more of the cups but i have 0 complaints  also the price on here is much cheaper than in stores 
great smoothie maker
so far this is great  i m using it daily  it s easy to use and super easy to clean  it blends easily and makes great smoothies 
don t see any reason to buy a more expensive model 
bought this and some spare cups as a birthday present for my daughter  it s been   6 weeks and she is using it a ton  she gets recipes off the internet  make it up the night before and puts the cup in the fridge  in the am  she just blends and brings the cup with her to drink on the way to her summer job  we bought this because it was a much better price point than others we looked at   so far we don t see any reason to have paid more  we asked her if there is anything she wished were different or better about it and she thought for a second and then said   nope  this does exactly what i wanted  
amaxing small heavy duty machine
this blender is amazing  i did my research before purchasing this machine  i have not had a problem with leakage  tends to happen if you fill it past the max fill line   always blends ingredients very well and the cups are sturdy  the blades are really sharp so please be very careful when cleaning them  i have had a few minor cuts due to this lol  the machine is slightly noisy however it does not affect my usage of the machine  great machine for an amazing price  since i tend to utilize 3 5 days per week i have to bleach the tops  even after washing them thoroughly with dish soap and hot water  due to them smelling sour  i think i will purchase more cups and lids lol 
soooo quiet compared to magic bullet 
i live in a place where others are asleep when i leave and arrive at odd hours  so the magic bullet was a nightmare  this is about a quarter the volume of noise    other than that i d say it s better built  and so are the cups  the lids are heavy duty and hold tight  there s an overall sense of weight that tells me that basically the magic bullet is a volkswagon bug    awesome for college but needs to be replaced part by part  and this is a tundra   haul your stuff and don t worry about the sand and puddles  
great for making healthy smoothies
works infinitely better than a blender and is uber fast in pulverizing fruits and vegetables  easy to clean in the dishwasher but make sure you handle the blades carefully   they are very sharp  love it 
works as advertised
so far  so good  very effective  thorough  and quick in making smoothies  i use mine every day in my cancer fighting regimen and i m beating that little devil with the help of this ninja  came quite well packaged but minus the two sippy cups the box said were within 
love it except for the recipe book
after one week of use  we love this nutri ninja pro  the one we bought came with a larger and smaller cup  the grinding action is fabulous and frozen fruits are no obstacle for it  the recipes in the included book are pretty yuck but we ve been making up our own recipes  for example pina colada  frozen pineapple  organic coconut milk  lime juice  and bananas  delish 
truly amazing 
i was really not expecting so much power from this  it is truly amazing    if you don t have this in your life then get it  it blends smoothly  you can feel the power when it s on and your hands are on it  the cups are very big and awesome as well  you can blend a lot  easy to clean  it s a little loud so just keep that in mind if you want to blend at 10 00pm   i absolutely love this  
amazing little machine
even better than what i imagined after reading tons of reviews  it is very  very sturdy and built of heavy duty materials  including the blades and the cups  i did read all the directions  which i recommend  and have not had a bit of trouble  it comes with a great recipe book and complete directions  it even shows you how to stack the cup for best performance  i have made some great smoothies  just read all the directions and take good care of your blender        you will be well rewarded 
i love this darn machine
i love this darn machine  i used to have a  20 blender  then i got this  no looking back  i make daily smoothies  use it for hummus  and basically anything a food processor would do  grinds down ice  frozen fruit  garbonzo beans  you name it  crazy fast  my only gripe is that the cups are wide and don t fit in standard cupholders  feels like a silly design oversight 
great product  used daily  pulse it like the instructions say 
purchased this as a gift for the guy who rents a room from me  he uses it every night  i ve used it once or twice  i believe the instructions say to pulse blitz it  i believe that s why i had heard complaints of similar products overheating  this model has a thermal fuse  so if it does overheat  it should protect the product and force the user to allow it to cool before continuing  that s never happened to him or i though 
great for smoothies 
while nowhere near as amazing as those vitamixes are  this thing is a beast when it comes to smoothies  the only drawback is that it s incredibly loud  so you may wake people up if you re making a smoothie at 5 30 am  it blends up berry seeds really well  i gag when seeds hit my tongue while drinking a smoothie  i have texture issues    not a problem with this little beast   love it   glad i purchased   huge upgrade from the magic bullet thingie 
excited to use this for smoothies and so  so much more 
exactly what i wanted  when i made the decision to purchase this  i asked myself what i would honestly be using it for  i looked back over my past few years when i lived with roommates and decided that i really only used this item for smoothies and mixed drinks  with that  i knew that i didn t need the full kitchen set but i am excited to see i can do so much more than just smoothies with this one  the recipe book was a great surprise as i didn t see that when i purchased it and i am looking forward to pairing this with my ninja coffee bar system to help me lose weight and feel great as i start the next chapter of my life 
quick and convenient
love it  so much better than having a regular blender  i stopped making morning smoothies because it was such a pain to clean the blender cup and blades every time but with this it is really easy and fast  it blends really well too 
highly recommend
got this to replace the giant size ninja blender  which is really terribly awful at making smoothies  this ninja pro  however  is awesome for making smoothies and i officially love it  quick and easy to use  the scale of this is actually funny       the motor and housing are huge and the cup itself is small     but i guess it takes a lot of real estate to keep a motor that powerful inside     love this and highly recommend it 
smoothies every morning 
i am really enjoying the ninja  even my husband is on board  we have experimented with lots of fruit veggie combos  i have a smoothie every morning  the ninja is powerful and truly  smooths  everything from spinach to ice  i ve never had a lump of anything in my smoothie  the fill line is and absolute  don t go over the line and you will not have any problems with leakage  love it  it was definitely a great choice 
love it 
i bought this back on 10 30 2016 and i still love it  i just used it this morning to make a shake  it s powerful and blends really well  it s a little loud  but  most  if not all blenders are  i definitely recommend this product 
5 stars couldn t be better
the ninja blender is one of the best blenders on the market right now from making smoothies to frozen margaritas it is a great machine  it comes with a very detailed recipe book that will have you trying to new drinks for months  the power in such a small machine that takes up little space is what sets it apart from the rest of the field 
great way to boost calorie on kids that are picky eaters
got this primarily for my kids  sometimes they don t want to eat so making smoothies of fruits  yogurt and nuts is healthy  taste good and keeps their calorie intake up  powdered peanut butter and dried egg whites are good ways to get the needed protein in their diets too  frozen fruit works great because you don t have to worry about it going bad and also makes the smoothie nice and cold  great product so far and have been using it for a couple months on a daily basis 
yes yes yes why did i not get this sooner
i honestly do not know why i did not get this sooner  last year i got on a morning smoothie kick and have a normal ninja which i love  but it was such a hassle cleaning out every morning for just one smoothie  this is fab  i make my smoothie and then rinse off the blade and pop the travel lid on and i am out the door to work love love love  purchase this and you will not regret it   i blend fresh and frozen fruits and spinach and it pures beautifully 
this thing is a beast 
my boss bought one of these for the office  because she and her husband drink a lot of protein shakes  as do i   for over a year  it has been used on an almost daily basis  some days as many as 4 or 5 times  and has held up like a champ  a couple of us like to make our shakes thick  and use a lot of ice   lately i ve noticed it takes a little longer to blend everything  but i think it s to be expected that the blades might be getting dull after a year of grinding ice  on here now shopping for that   looks like i can replace the entire blade assembly for less than  20  happy customer 
love it 
i love this blender  i never used my old blender  but now with this one i make smoothies for breakfast several times a week  it is fast and only takes a minute to blend everything  i have also put crushed ice in it and made shaved ice  i don t use the to go cup lids  i pour my smoothie into a disposable cups to drink on the drive to work  once i blend my smoothie i just rinse the cup and blades with water and leave them out to dry to use tomorrow  my go to smoothie is half of a ripe frozen banana  half a cup of frozen blueberries  half a cup of vanilla soy milk  or any milk type  and half a cup of water 
fast  quiet  blends everything i ve thrown at it 
blends everything  fast  quieter than my normal size blender  and the travel cups are awesome for quick morning smoothie blend and go  the recipe book has some nice tasting options too  always nice to try a different mix  update  one month in and this continues to impress  i will have to look into their bigger versions so the missus and i can both use it in the morning  i ve blended carrots  spinach  and other leafy greens without issue using very little water or juice in my smoothies 
love it 
strong blender  works as advertised  i like it s simple function and quick blend ability  i use it to make smoothies and pulverize cooked   steamed vegetables to create a sauce to  disappear  in food so my toddler doesn t refuse to eat because she sees an icky bit of carrot or other vegetable  the size of the blender and blending cups is prefect for my family of two adults and a toddler 
ninja works 
this blender was my final decision after reading countless reviews  i ve made a smoothie at least twice a day since receiving this blender and i have nothing but great things to say  the ninja is so easy to assemble and use  within five minutes i was ready to make my first smoothie  the blender hardly takes up any space on my counter and cleaning after use is so simple  i love the cups that came with the ninja  which makes my mornings hassle free  the price is great and you cannot go wrong 
works great 
i love my nutri ninja pro  it works so fast and makes an incredible smooth shake in seconds  i use it every morning  it s super easy to clean  i never use my blender any more  my go to shake is ice  almond milk  protein powder  a banana  and peanut butter  it takes me under 2 minutes to whip up and i have my morning shake to get my day started when i m in a hurry  i have also made my kids some delicious fruit smoothies in it and they love it too 
works well  really loud 
after about a month of almost daily use   we re pleased with how this performs  blends pretty much anything quickly and smoothly  it cleans up in the dishwasher pretty well  as long as you don t let smoothie junk dry in it first  it is louder than our last two blenders   noticeably  if noise is a concern  i e  living in an apartment with paper thin walls   think twice about this blender  otherwise  if performance is your goal   this is a winner  we purchased this because it was one of the best personal blenders according to america s test kitchen testing  and we ve been pleased with the purchase  pros  it works well  blends pretty much anything and everything quickly and smoothly cons  its really loud if i could change anything about this product  make it quieter packaging type  retail packaging   full color printed box  just what you d get from any brick and mortar store if you found this review helpful   please click the  yes  button below this review indicating so   thanks 
maybe my best purchase ever on amazon
absolutely love this product  so easy to clean  takes 30 seconds from using it to leaving it clean to dry  it has literally changed my diet and lifestyle  have lost 10  of my body weight in 3 weeks using it for at least one meal a day  works for everything  i even use it to scramble eggs  fun to use with the kids and i save money not using the drive thru anymore  its fun using fresh ingredients to make up random concoctions  chops extremely efficient and fast  i have bought two  one its quite a bit more quiet than the other 
great product   
ninja blender works better than all of the other ones on the market   ive bought 3 different name brands and this one is by far the most solid  the blending cups are thicker and sturdier    the blending blades are also sturdier    i used to have to blend for 30 45 seconds  which was not at all a problem but would not make shake worthiness   this one is 10 seconds and i can blend almonds into my shake  i truly enjoy this little machine    follow instructions and go   
i cant find a thing wrong with it 
as stated in my headline i can t find a thing wrong with it  the designers knew what they were after when designing this product  it does a great job with everything that it says it will do and it does it very efficiently  cleanup is super simple  in less than a minute  before i workout  i fill half full with frozen strawberries  a small banana  a 2 scoops of protein and fill to the line with water  process with 6 8  2 second pulses and my post workout drink is ready  drinking this while driving  as apposed to eating individual items  while driving is much less distracting and no accidental messes 
love 
i love this thing  small but mighty  i have been looking at this model for a while now but on black friday i pulled the trigger  i initially purchased this for my toddler who is the world s pickiest eater  the thought was i would be able to sneak some nutrition into him via smoothies  and although he seems to like them i love them even more  they sell frozen organic fruits and veggies at walmart so assembling the stuff to make smoothies is easier than ever  it s simple to use and i toss the parts in the dishwasher when i m done  i d say go for it  even if you use it once and a while the price can t be beat and it s uses are many 
blends like a pro
love it  i make daily protein shakes with milk  protein powder  fruit  peanut butter  and ice  this blends it all quickly and thoroughly  why did i wait so long to get this 
great blender  very convenient that the cups you blend    
my protein spinach smoothies are as smooth as can be now  no more gross chunks  great blender  very convenient that the cups you blend in are the ones you drink out of and that there is a smaller and larger size  perfect for my husband and i 
blends everything to a smooth consistency
this is an upgrade from my magic bullet  which i also love but which often left chunks of unprocessed fruits  this one makes my drink completely smooth  just be sure you have the lid screwed on tightly when you use 
cuts like a ninja  but not silent like one
in the few weeks i have owned the ninja  i have been drinking more smoothies than i have in years  it is compact and easy to clean  it is loud  so make you smoothies in the evening to avoid waking up the family or neighbors  as long as you do not fill the cups above the marked fill line the ninja does a great job in tearing up whatever food stuff i put in it  if it maintains it s performance in the long term then i will consider this one of the most useful purchases i have made 
good smoothie maker
i like the way it whips up smoothies very easily  love it s ease  i had leaking on the blade lid on the side that goes into the blender  i m not sure why this is happening unless a washer or something has gone bad  i called ninja at 877 646 5288 and they are sending me a new blade  great company standing behind their products  thank you
well worth the money   
unbeatable for the price  gone through several  quality  blenders and this is the best  very well constructed  i use it for blending the morning smoothie and  although it sounds a bit like a cement mixer  it really does the job  looking for a quality blender at a reasonable price   this is it 
great product
bought this as a gift for my son along with additional cups and lids  he uses it every day and loves it  i also ordered another as a gift for my elderly father who needed a nutrition boost after losing his appetite due to having major surgery  he basically drank smoothies rather than solid food  it was a great help 
    a review to make sure i could get a good use out of it before writing a review
i want to say that i waited a few months of using the blender before writing a review to make sure i could get a good use out of it before writing a review  my wife and i love the blender  we went with this one because of the stronger motor in it and i am glad we did  it has no trouble blending anything we put in it  just make sure to put enough liquids in there to actually blend  we will probably have to buy more cups for it since we both like the big one it comes with  only downside is to clean it you have to remove the rubber ring that sits around the base of the blade and its hard to get to  when you finally lift it up its pretty gross whats inside so i recommend cleaning often if you use if a lot  otherwise great product  we bought it for black friday and got a good deal on it 
excellent  though not quite perfect
lots of power  easy to use  i like that there s no power settings   just add ingredients and blend  easy to clean  cons  sometimes you have to work awhile to ensure the blades are screwed on square  as they want to be cocked a little  which leaks  if you don t pay attention   and  i would have preferred the same size cups  rather than two different sizes  happy with my purchase 
perfect for frozen fruit
after looking at several blenders i decided to go with this one and i am happy i did  i have other ninja products and this one works just as well as the other products i have had for years  we use this daily for smoothies with frozen fruits and we have never had difficulty using it  it is easy to use and clean  there is nothing else i could ask for in this product and i hope it lasts as long as my regular blender 
great  easy to use
i love this device  so far ive used it for smoothies  great texture   making real whipped cream  and making organic salad dressing  easy to use and easier to clean than my blender  i love that it has two sizes of containers and two sturdy  useful lids 
this blender is perfect for morning smoothies
this blender is perfect for morning smoothies  i love that it comes with two different size cups  one for me and one for my husband  and i love that is makes for easy cleaning  compared to a large blender that you d have to take apart and wash right after using   it definitely still makes some noise for being a single blender but it s not so noisy that it s bothersome  haven t had an issue with it not crushing ice or blending fruits veggies  would recommend 
works great for frozen fruit and fresh veggies
didn t expect to like this as much as i do  whoever first invented a type of blender where you don  t have to wash out a cup and blender is a genius  nothing easier to use than this and works fine with ice  frozen fruit  carrots  beets  anything i ve thrown in it so far  glad i bought it 
this blender is awesome  i am in love
this blender is awesome  i am in love  i actually borrowed my friend s bullet  competitor to the ninja  recently and was floored by how crappy it was compared to my ninja and amazon has a very competitive price compared to retail
this thing rocks
so far  so good   this thing is awesome  i ve been throwing in a cup of yogurt  frozen fruit and some milk and voila    instant fruit shake that s deeeeelish  super quick and easy cleanup too    next i gotta try some ideas in the recipe book that came with it 
mom loves shakes
bought this for my mom and she made smoothies for everyone lol  she loves it  i bought 5 months ago and although she doesn t use it as much as the first few weeks but she uses it often to make healthy shakes 
i love this thing
i love this thing  it gets the job done  compactly and very quickly  my only complaint is that the motor is loud  and because you have to stand next to it to push it down for it to work  you can t leave the room while it is blending  to save your hearing    my solution is to push it down with one hand  stretching my arm and standing as far away as possible  while plugging the ear closest to the blender with my other hand  this may sound extreme  but i have very sensitive ears  so i put this here for others who may share that issue  that said  i m still very happy with this brilliant little blender 
truly is the best 
wow  the ninja is really powerful  we compared how the texture of my spouse s shake she did with the nutri bullett 900 and she was amazed on how it tasted  it was more smoother  less thick  flavor was more powerful as it was properly mix  the clean up of the blade is very simple and it has the lid that helps her while she drives  this is a missing item with nutri bullett  she is even tempted to buy the main blender for her normal cooking  it s the best i have ever bought
