power cord is messed up
power cord fits loosely into back of tower so if it gets bumped it turns the computer off   
returned the day i received it 
returned it day i received hard drive didn t work  added a star because refund was quick  bought a new hp tower for  300 at best buy  do yourself a favor and spend the extra   instead of buying a 10 year old computer
