bigger than expected but good quality 
my wife thought these would be a little smaller  but the quality is very good  and i would think anything smaller would be an ineffective rain blocker  they came with a leather cover that could be looped around a belt or strap  unnecessary for our purposes  so we tossed it  however  i could see it being of use to others
