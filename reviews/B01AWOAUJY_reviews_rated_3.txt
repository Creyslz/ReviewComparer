so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says my window 10 key is not valid so i have to pay for it but the computer does work as it should i have had it now for almost a week and have been using it daily

overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player because it was broken internally  after replacing it seems to work ok  the casing was a little beat up but  that s what you get for refurbished 
three stars
generally like dell  ended up buying a dell computer  but this tower just did not work out for me
on the fence about performance
just got everything setup and wanted to write a review  packaging was good  pc worked right out the box but since plugging it in  i ve noticed several issues 1  it s not quiet  i keep hearing a clicking noise 2  moves very slow  even before i attempted to download any software 3  screen blacks out and shuts entire internet session down  i ve never purchased a certified refurbished pc but so far not good  i love that is comes with windows though 
good bang for your buck
good bang for your buck  daughter can t play minecraft bc of integrated gpu  case isn t standard size limited upgradeability   great web browser 
three stars
a bit slower than i expected 
fast response  other concerns 
my dell optiplex   it s a great little machine i loved it    great to play very fast response on clicking actions  but  for some odd reason it glitched on me  so now when i attempt to power it on  it doesn t turn on  only the  3 4  numbers light up on the front 
the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had
windows 10 is all new to me  hard for me to adjust and learn  the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had  i need to follow up to find out why
