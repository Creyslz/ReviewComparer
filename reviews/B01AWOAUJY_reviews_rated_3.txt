so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says my window 10 key is not valid so i have to pay for it but the computer does work as it should i have had it now for almost a week and have been using it daily 
a couple of issues     but otherwise a good computer
i ran into a couple of snaffu s with this desktop  side note   i am techno retard  so please excuse my lack of expert terminology   i have a 27  hp monitor that i wanted to use my hdmi cable for optimal picture viewing  but this desktop does not come with an hdmi port   no kidding  look at the pictures   you can use your old school vga monitor cable  but if your monitor supports hdmi  don t expect to have hdmi functionality right of the bat  i did some research and to solve this issue  i bought a displayport to hdmi adapter and connected it to the tiny  unlabeled  illuminated d p port on the back of the computer  my monitor now supports hdmi quality picture  https   www amazon com gp product b017q8zvwk ref oh aui detailpage o03 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 another issue i encountered was slow internet speeds  my desktop came with a 802 11n wireless chip adapter already plugged into one of the back usb ports  i ran an online speed test and wasn t picking up more than 2 mbps  very slow  to solve this issue  i connected an ethernet cable directly to my modem from my desktop and am now picking up 35  mbps  i know this stuff may seem obvious as you re reading it  but it took me a while to figure this stuff out on my own without any help from dell  finally  one other thing  the video graphics card is pretty sub par  i tried playing guild wars 2 and it s incredibly slow choppy   to be fair  there are reviews on here stating this is not a gaming computer  just had to find out the hard way  i guess   actually  if you re reading this  is it possible to upgrade the graphics card in this desktop to make it gaming compatible   one other thing  don t get confused with  it comes pre installed with windows 10   if you re like me  perhaps you thought it would come pre installed with microsoft office  but it does not  i guess i really need to brush up on my computer lingo     
overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player    
overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player because it was broken internally  after replacing it seems to work ok  the casing was a little beat up but  that s what you get for refurbished 
three stars
generally like dell  ended up buying a dell computer  but this tower just did not work out for me
on the fence about performance
just got everything setup and wanted to write a review  packaging was good  pc worked right out the box but since plugging it in  i ve noticed several issues 1  it s not quiet  i keep hearing a clicking noise 2  moves very slow  even before i attempted to download any software 3  screen blacks out and shuts entire internet session down  i ve never purchased a certified refurbished pc but so far not good  i love that is comes with windows though 
good bang for your buck
good bang for your buck  daughter can t play minecraft bc of integrated gpu  case isn t standard size limited upgradeability   great web browser 
three stars
a bit slower than i expected 
fast response  other concerns 
my dell optiplex   it s a great little machine i loved it    great to play very fast response on clicking actions  but  for some odd reason it glitched on me  so now when i attempt to power it on  it doesn t turn on  only the  3 4  numbers light up on the front 
the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had
windows 10 is all new to me  hard for me to adjust and learn  the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had  i need to follow up to find out why 
the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have    
the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have updated everything and i done all of the troubleshooting and it still randomly reboots  i have no idea why 
not bad 
okay so far  two things that future buyers need to be aware of  one  the pc i received did not work with wifi nor could i set it up  had to use a direct ethernet connection to the modem two  windows 10 was not preinstalled for upgrade from windows 7  had to download from microsoft directly  also  it is only 160 gb hard drive  but after win10 installation plus a few others i still had enough space leftover  a little  buggy  at first when trying to set up virus protection and scanning  etc  but after a few days all is working efficiently  not bad 
too mu8ch space used up by windows 10 
too mu8ch space used up by windows 10  should have left the space open to the user not the person who gets the kick back from the advertisers
great for it s price
it s not too bad but  it s not compatible with many things that i would like to do on it    it s lasting me long enough until i can get a new one  and it s a lot better than the one i used before this  it s a little under priced though  a  100 pc should be a lot worse than how it is now
