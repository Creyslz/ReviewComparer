great sound for budget headphones
i ve really enjoyed these mpow bluetooth headphones  especially for the price  at an entry level price  you get good sound and long battery life  it doesn t have the really deep bass like some other headphones do  but they offer decent balanced sound  if you wear them for more than an hour  it could start to hurt your ears if you have larger ears  if you use the bluetooth feature  make sure you either turn your headphones or phone volume all the way up to maximize your volume  with one turned all the way up then you can control the volume with the other device  they pair really fast with an iphone 6s plus and they have audio cues to let you know what mode the headphones are in  making a call was clear  but having my voice muffled by the over the ear style headphones isn t ideal for me  so i probably wouldn t use them for long calls  while they don t have active noise cancellation  they do a good job at keeping background noise out because of the style 
great pair of bluetooth headphones for the price
as a certified audio professional who mainly listens to and composes rock music  i can say that at this price point you are not going to get sennheiser  bose or beats audio quality out of the box  however  for the price these are useable headphones that are more than capable of providing decent audio quality  once the right adjustments are made   they require a bit of frequency gain reduction between 60 250hz to reduce boom and a boost at around 16khz to establish clarity  once youve done that youll have a more balanced sound from these headphones  the bluetooth volume controls  and battery status bar indicators of these headphones are natively supported on android  but not on macos   in other words when you adjust the volume on your headphones it will directly adjust the volume control on your android device  on the mac the headphones volume is independent of macos  play pause and skip buttons work natively on both platforms  there are no latency issues when watching video  lips move in sync with audio  the mpow 059 supports the sbc audio codec exclusively  which means no aac or aptx is present  it would have been great to see support for aac seeing as it is a superior codec to sbc but nonetheless sound quality is reasonable  macos users will need to download the hardware io tools for xcode from apples developer page in order to get the bluetooth explorer application  this application will allow you to increase the bitpool value from its default value of 40 to 53  this will dramatically improve the audio quality of these headphones and any other bluetooth headphones that rely solely on the sbc codec  for those who want specifics  a bit pool value of 53 is equal to a bitrate of 325 kbps  sbc at 325 kbps is the equivalent of mp3 at 256 kbps  when the youve downloaded hardware io tools for xcode and have opened the bluetooth explorer app you will see the apps name in your menubar  go to tools   audio options or command   shift   a  this will bring up the window for you to edit the sbc audio settings  under sbc codec options set all bitpool values to 53 and close the window  this will ensure that the audio quality remains optimal  close the window and re connect your bluetooth headphones  build quality seems reasonable  hinges are reinforced with metal  only time will demonstrate the endurance of these headphones but superficially speaking the headphones appear to be quite sturdy  the ear cups and headband are made of a soft synthetic leather which provides initial comfort but they are a bit shallow in depth and can place a bit of pressure on the ears when the headset is worn for an extended period of time  battery life is reasonable  accessories include a micro usb cable for charging and a 3 5 mm audio cable which is handy for more critical listening and for events in which the battery has lost its charge  the velvet like pouch is a great inclusion and provides protection against dust and scratches  these headphones are definitely worth the price and i doubt youll find better at this price point 
great quality for the price
really great headphones for the price  i had a pair of  60 headphones   i honestly prefer these  they were specifically bass heavy headphones but ended up being muffly sounding so i bought these instead   i can honestly say that the mpow headphones are better overall  they are very crisp and clear but they do not have heavy bass at all  i listen to a lot of bass heavy dubstep   these headphones do not have strong bass in my opinion whatsoever  but on a plus note  as i said  the sound is very crisp   clear   the volume does get decently loud  if your phone device is at full volume the headphones can still go louder which is great  kind of wish it had a hard case instead of the sack but thats not really a big deal  super comfortable on your head  super soft pads  also  these headphones are super simple to operate   connect to devices  i would recommend these for sure 
pretty decent for commuting 
for what they cost  these do a pretty good job  the sound quality is fine but not great  these are by no stretch of the imagination bose headphones    and they occasionally cut out for a moment here and there when on bluetooth mode  i use them for commuting on public transportation  and it s really nice not to have to deal with tangling cords with my bag  etc   i also use them occasionally at my desk at work  and was worried about sound carrying over as some folks have mentioned  but i asked my officemates and no one could hear anything  i think as long as the cup is well fitted around your ear  no sound should come out  they re definitely large and in charge  but i prefer over ear to on ear  so that s what you get  they ve held a charge amazingly well so far  i ve used them off and on for over a month now and haven t yet had to charge them after their initial charge  the buttons are a little cheap feeling  and the voice confirmation of settings  power on  power off  etc   drive me nuts  but overall they re decent enough and do the job 
superior quality
these headphones are actually a little bit better than i thought when i decided to buy a pair  i wanted better quality in terms of hearing audio  but i m not exactly someone who listens to music with devices all the time  this seemed to be the best choice  and i do think it s worth it  in terms of audio  it does sound crisp and clear   but at the same time can rock out if you want to hear it full volume  the only real problem is one of the good features that it has  if you like to wear headphones for a long period of time it will feel slightly uncomfortable over the ears  but that gives superior sound  almost to the point where you could tune out others around you 
great headphones  just a little tight on my ears
overall impression  these are great headphones for the price but  perhaps due to the size of my head  i can t wear them for long sound quality  i m really impressed with these headphones considering the price range they re in  the sound is crystal clear and they re great at minimizing sound intrusion  my neighbors were doing some serious construction the other day and i couldn t hear them with these headphones on  these don t provide a massive bass experience but what you ll hear is the best i ve experienced for headphones under  100 fit  for starters  i m 6 2  and always have a hard time finding head related gear  think sunglasses  hats  that fits properly  i don t know why head stuff is so challenging for me  maybe i m an alien  but these are too tight on my head  the padding  both on the ears and on the top of the head  is great but i can still only stand wearing them for 15 20 minutes at a time before my ears can t take the pressure anymore  bonus  i didn t realize from the picture but these fold down to a compact size really nicely  they ll make for great travel headphones 
good sound  but need some breaking in 
nice headphones with good sound  but had to adjust them slightly to fit comfortably  when i first got them  they clamped too tightly on my head  which would be great for exercising  but i wear them for hours at a desk   to stretch them out  i put them around a box for a couple nights  the amazon box they came in  and now they fit comfortably  i also noticed they are more comfortable for my head if i wear them backward  controls on the left side  so the ear pads don t rest on my jaw  they are heavier than headphones without bluetooth  so my head will tire faster  but that comes with the territory   for reference  my head is about average for an adult female  my only other complaint is the buttons are a little loud when i click them while wearing the headphones  but not unbearable  all around happy with this purchase after breaking them in a bit 
really wanted to like this product
i really  really wanted to like this product  but sadly i cannot  bought it as a present for my mom and was super excited  they re really pretty and she really likes pink  so perfect gift right  wrong  when i opened the box  it looked good  it came with all the parts    and then i went to charge it  i actually bought another pair before this  but in blue as they didn t have the pink headphones at the time  and like the other ones    that i returned because it wouldn t charge  this wouldn t either  i first thought that  oh yes  it s charging  the lights came on  and then when i went to check on it a few minutes later  the lights were off and i thought  oh wow  that certainly charged quickly  tried to turn it on  turned on for a second  and it powered on  then it immediately powered off  thinking that it was possibly user error  i tried again  same thing  so naturally i went to charge it again  this time using a different usb port  and then when that didn t work  used a wall charger  the lights went on  and few minutes later  the lights went out again  it wasn t charging  so i contacted the company  they were courteous  and they told me to try again  using different charging methods  which i already did    and then they told me to return it  they also said that they were willing to pay up to  6 in shipping and handling  quite generous of them i thought  but then i found out that it was going to cost me significantly more to ship it back  i ended up returning it to amazon  as that s free  and i really don t want to do anything with them anymore  very disappointed  really wanted to like it  but     well  and that s the end of my rant  edit  04 08 2018 due to excellent customer service  i received a new pair of headphones  and lo and behold  they work  for the price  the sound is pretty decent  they re comfortable  and my mom loves them 
great when connected via 3 5mm audio cable  not so great sound with bluetooth
i just returned some very overpriced  very defective sony cans  and i m happy to say that these far less expensive mpow headphones have them beat in just about every way so far  they re still new  but they re comfy  they fold up for easy storage while still being adjustable in size  come with a nice bag to sleeve them in  and   most importantly   they sound great     if you re connecting via the included 3 5mm headphone jack  the one place they fall short is in the same area a lot of bluetooth headphones do  music sounds like garbage when dealing with bluetooth audio compression  and unfortunately  they don t appear to have any tricks on hand to offset this issue  the net result is that music sounds thin and hollow when playing over wireless  the difference is huge between bluetooth vs  3 5mm connections  all in all  very happy with the purchase  just wish they had more  oomph  when playing over bluetooth  i ll keep them plugged in instead 
nice 
edit  after my original review  i was sent another set of headphones  i set them up for my dad today and we both tried them  theyre pretty solid  they fit over the ear as opposed to on top of it  and that makes them much more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time  nice noise cancellation is great  nice colors too  weve been testing them almost all day  and the battery is still pretty full  im glad we tried the replacement  he really likes them  the right speaker didnt work and the left speaker sounded like i was a bat trying to use echolocation  i bought these as a christmas gift for my dad  and was sure he was just setting it up wrong  nope  now i have to return them and think of something else 
stopped pairing with transmitters   had them less than a month   update in review 
  update below   these headphones are testing my patience  let me start with the good then i ll talk about the bad  pros  they re pretty comfortable  they weren t that expensive  they look nice and feel sturdy  cons  they stop pairing with my bluetooth transmitters  i have 2 different brands of transmitters and for some reason these headphones will pair with one  work for a few hours then boom  it won t pair again  i ve tried making sure both headphones and transmitters were fully charged but it s a no go  the headphones like one night stands with my transmitters  it will work once or twice then never again  i can t tell you how many times i ve tried pairing these with the two transmitters i have and it just doesn t work  then eventually  i can t even get the headphones to pair at all  it goes from power on to power off  completely useless if i can t use the wireless option of these headphones  i m very disappointed  update  the company sent me a replacement and it s been working great  i m able to pair it with no issues  the first pair has again began pairing with my computer s blue tooth but still won t pair with my bluetooth transmitters but that s okay since the new pair works fine 
very nice product 
so far very good  i connect this headset unit using the bluetooth capability to a trond bt duo wireless transmitter   receiver  both sold here on amazon for a reasonable price but not as a package deal   individually   the trond bt transmitter is connected to my vizio 32  smart hd tv through the tv s rca audio out connections  the audio is superb through this headset  there s no latency or hesitation in lip sync transmissions  something i cannot stand to see hear  i tried several other transmitter headset combinations purchased at walmart but they all had either latency problems and or there was background static frying sound in the headset  there s no background noises in this tv application  the headset is very comfortable to wear and is quite appealing to the eye  big grin   i recommend this combination to anyone else who is planning to add bt to their tv 
amazing cans for the price
battery life  a  comfort  a  sound quality  b pairing process  a  durability  a  connectivity a  batterylife  holy smokes  this thing will go and go like your typical energizer bunny  comfort  i ve never found myself wanting to take these off simply because they hurt my ears or head  very comfortable  sound quality  this is where you get what you pay for  they re your standard cheap can s sound quality  they don t touch etymotic  shure  or klipsh  but they re not awful  i can admire music from nearly every speaker i hear it out of  the average person won t have an issue with the sql  pairing process  i know this is important to a lot of you  the pairing process was very easy with my iphone x  and my macbook pro 15   late 2016   the caveat here  is how mpow allows two connected devices at the same time  there have been times i ve turned these on 50 feet away from my computer  expecting them to pair to my phone  only to have forgotten they were last connected to my computer  wouldn t you know  these headphones connected to the computer  they stuttered a bit  50 feet was also through concrete walls      but the connectivity distance is surprising on these  make sure you only keep one thing paired to them at a time though  durability  i list durability because i work in the construction industry  so everything is subject to destruction  these headphones have held up to the tough environment i thrust them through  connectivity  i already elaborated on the 50 feet range  surprisingly strong connectivity 
awesome price for everything i need 
terrific price for a very comfortable set of solid headphones  the foam pads stay on my bald head while i m at the gym  the sound is full from all sources  both corded and wireless  honestly  i ve yet to have a need to turn them all the way up  the battery life is better than expected  as well  i can go a couple days with then connected to my phone or ipad without a low battery warning  only two things made me deduct from the five star rating  and they re both easy fixes  1  the 3 5mm cord that was provided with the unit is only 3 feet long  max  get a new cord if you need these to be wired  2  if connected to two devices simultaneously  you may hear static if one device is playing but the other makes a sound  solution  connect only to the device you d like to use  if i could give 4 5  i d definitely do so 
great 
they stay put  sound isn t the best  and it isn t noise cancelling  but i think these are worth the buy  they are wonderful so far 
terrible audio stuttering  constantly have to restart the headphones
fit and finish of the headphones is decent  and the sound quality is decent  but wow  these headphones have some of the worst audio stuttering i ve ever encountered in a bluetooth headphone  broken  stuttering audio if you pause your media for over 3 minutes  forcing you to power cycle the headphones to re establish a solid connection  happens consistently  regardless of the battery level  can t recommend with the frequency of stuttering that occurs  update  the merchant reached out after seeing this review and sent a replacement headset  the new headset functions much better 
good set of headphones 
update 3 8 18 for my initial review  i ve rated these headphones 2 5  but now i m updating my review and rating to 4 5 and heres why  i was contacted by patozon company and they were concerned about my issues and wanted to make it a better experience for me  they sent over the new headphone replacement without extra cost  they arrived quickly then anticipated  right out the box the replacements looked a lot better then the first pair  the build quality was nice and the hinges seemed to be better then the first pair  as for the fit  i wear glasses all the time  but i was still able to get a nice seal around the ears and block the noises around me  as for the sound quality  they still struggle just a bit  but with my iphone  i m able to change the settings for the music and get something more desirable  another great feature i like  is the battery status  on the iphone  it displays how much charge is left on the headset  not every headphones offer that feature  overall this was a better headset then i thought  i also have to commend patozon for their great customer service  they were patient and helpful and solved my issues swiftly  thank you  old review  they are a mediocre pair of headphones  they do the simple job of playing music  the build quality is rather decent  but just like every other headphones  the area that should concern is the hinges  not sure how they ll hold during time  for the price you get something just ok  just don t expect those high end features here 
i m happy so far   
so far they work pretty well and they are decently comfortable  there was a few instances  3     times  on the first night i used them that the sound of the tv show i was watching went to full static  painful    i paused the tv show and started it again and the static was gone  it only happened that night and i have used them maybe 4 or 5 more times since then  maybe it was interference from something nearby  i don t know   but so far  there has not been a repeat  this is my first ever pair of bluetooth headphones and probably only my second pair of over the ear headphones so i can t really compare the quality to anything else  i will say that the seller patozon seems to want to provide good customer service   they have already emailed me twice asking if all is ok and providing some tips  i believe i also saw them reply to some reviews to assist people who have issues  would i buy another pair of mpow headphones and would i buy again from patozon   as of right now  yes  if the headphones turn out to be lemons and blow out my eardrums or something  i will definitely update this review 
review edited  read update 
read some good review so i got myself a pair since i like wireless things best  the sound im disapointed with  it sounds muffled  i listened to some music with these and then compared it to just my standard apple headphones that come with iphone  the difference was immediately noticeable  it is muffled  the sound is quieter  and overal just does not sound good  the mic is also not good according to my fiance  he only tends to complain about the quality of the call when i use these  compared to my old apple earbuds  i wouldnt know since i cant hear myself but since he complains even when i dont tell him im using them i assume it is infact the headphones  the headphones also tend to tell me they are at max volume but then i look at my device and i can clearly see there is much more volume to go  very disappointing  will not order again  update 3 15 i received a new pair of headphones from the company an no charge since i was not really satisfied as mentioned above  and personally i still dont like them but my fiance and his friend really like them  im probably just picky with headphones  and that is not really the headphones fault so i went ahead and changed my review from 2 stars  at least my fiance now has some nice headphones for him to use that he really likes 
pretty good overall
theyre about what you should expect for the price  standard over the ear head phones  nothing amazing sound quality wise  but fairly quality materials and acceptable recreational sound quality  if youre getting these for the bluetooth functionality specifically  look elsewhere as the bluetooth function leaves much to be desired  i was lucky enough to get them paired and working with a usb dongle with my pc for about 5 minutes  upon restart of the computer they werent recognized again  trying to use them connected to my iphone and ipad were much easier  but the connection dropped frequently  i finally gave up after several hours of troubleshooting and researching and resolved to the 1 8 by 1 8 aux cord option  if they last a couple months in this state  id say they were worth  40  usb dongle not included     also the driver the dongle came with was on a mini blue ray disk  and the instructions if you didnt have access to a capable drive  use a computer with a blueray disc reader and copy using a flash drive  oh thanks guys  well thought out suggestion there  how about a download link  you really selling that many headphones you couldnt afford the server dues for all the traffic  give me a break 
mic stopped working after 4
update  i received a replacement from the sender  that was very nice of them  this unit s microphone does work much better  so it appears as if the hardware  mic  was defective  we will see what happens in the next few months if the mic fails again  otherwise  i am glad they are reading and acknowledging the comments and ratings  i used this at work so i can teleconference  not even four months and the microphone died  not worth it 
really surprised  
i just got these  i charged them up  took about 3 hours for the initial charge  paired to my galaxy 8 really easy  the sound isn t 100  amazing but its 95  good  it cancels out a lot of noise  it fits snug around my ears and my head without being so tight to give me a headache  i tested them out doing laundry  i live in about a 900 sq ft apartment  went all over the apartment with my phone being in my room and didnt lose connection  i cant wait to try these at the gym  i do notice however a slight buzzing but i got use to it after an hour and didnt notice it with any other songs  they are very light weight as well  i may purchase another pair for my husband
