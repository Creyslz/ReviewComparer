owned 6 weeks
i m a healthcare professional and bought this after researching the competition  i e    vita mix   after reading through a gazillion comments and reviews  including cr who rates the ninja  2  i opted for the lower priced ninja  i have used mine twice a day for the 6 weeks i have owned it  i use it for making smoothies  i blend for health  i have a morning fruit and berry smoothie and i have an afternoon veggie smoothie  blending is a really convenient way to get in all your servings of fruit and veggies each day without removing the  very important  fiber  so far  i love my ninja  i have had stuff made with a vita mix in the past  but have never done a side by side comparison  though i can think of a few differences that are meaningful for me  one  the vita mix generates heat  they use it as a selling feature  that you can use it to make soups  but i like my smoothies cold  so it s not something i look for in a blender  secondly  vita mix seems to win in all the comparisons with ninja on smoothness  or thoroughness of blending  the only reason i knocked one star off the ninja is because i have noticed that my smoothies are a bit chewier after several weeks of blender use  i attribute that to the fact that ninja relies  apparently  on their sharp blades  which naturally dull with use especially when blending frozen berries or ice  which both of my smoothies contain   i ve noticed a subtle change in texture  no chunks  but definitely not a fine blend  my understanding is that vita mix has dull blades that work for years  they do not rely so much on sharpness as they do on speed  the other thing  in addition to heat  that you get with a vita mix is aeration  foam   which i do not notice with the ninja  my smoothies are full of fruit and veggies  so they are full of fiber  if you are okay with having some noticeable fiber in your blend over time  the ninja is a great deal at about 1 5 the cost  if that matters to you  expect that you will have it in time  i started to notice it after about 25 blends   the blender cleans very easily and is simple to use  i ve never had to remove the top to tamp stuff down and i use 3 cups of leafy greens like kale and arugula  as well as whole carrots  celery  apples  and never have chunks  overall it s a great machine  i cannot rate longevity since i ve only had it 6 weeks  but so far i m very pleased  update  it s january 2018  i owned the ninja about 3 months and ended up getting a vita mix  i still stand by my original review  but there is a difference  the ninja starts out pretty great  but then over time things do no blend as well  i drink 2 smoothies a day  one veggie  one fruit   so i use it a minimum of 2x a day  over time i started calling my ninja smoothies   grainies   the blades start out very sharp  and the technology depends on that  but they dull with use and it shows in the results  the vita mix does not depend on blade sharpness  but power  it pummels everything to pieces  itty bitty pieces   i am amazed at the flour i can make with it  also  the heat i mentioned is not a factor but a feature  most things are blended in less than a minute  35 seconds often   so nothing really gets warm unless you leave it on in order to generate heat  the ninja is a good blender  especially for the cost  but i don t think one can fairly compare it to a vita mix  it s like comparing apples and oranges 
easy to clean and does the job 
i like the blender  it does the job but  i wish it blended things like spinach a little bit more finely  the blades don t quite get far enough to the edge and little bits seem to escape the blades  this is a very minor complaint  i also find it annoying that the lid needs to latch on while the blending is in progress  sometimes i like to add ingredients after the blending has commenced  my old blender had a removable center on the lid to do just this and i definitely miss that feature  on the positive  its so easy to clean  the fact that the blade comes out makes all the difference in the world 
i love this blender
i love this blender  it s easy to use and easy to clean  this is my first blender and i didn t even have to read the instructions to figure out how to use it  sometimes when it begins to blend  pieces of fruit vegetables stick to the glass  such as a spinach leaf  and you have to turn it off and push the piece of fruit vegetable back down to blend  but that s my only  issue  so far  it creates smooth smoothies  i ve been using it twice a day for two weeks now 
impressive ice crusher and smoothie maker  just wish it was compatible with individual blending cups 
we ve been battling our blender s ability to crush ice for years  since our kiddos are huge smoothie fans and we enjoy frozen drinks  we needed a blender that could get the job done without leaving chunks of ice and a metallic smell in the air  after reading the stellar reviews and watching the impressive ice crushing infomercial  we decided to invest in a ninja  when this particular model had a flash sale   53 49   we pulled the trigger  pros  1  it crushes ice and frozen fruit like a powerhouse  leaving no chunks behind  2  the blade design is brilliant  easy to insert and remove with one fluid movement   just don t forget to put blade in before blending   3  blade removal makes pouring  scraping  and cleaning easy   be careful  it s sharp   4  secured top system locks out leaks and splashes  5  flip spout allows small food items and liquid to be added while blending  6  has the ability to pulse or run blender hands free  7  holds a ton of liquid  great for lots of people  cons  1  if not full  dry items  spinach  will jump to the top and stick to the sides requiring stopping and stirring manually  2  does not pair with individual blending cups as recommended by amazon  3  cord is too short  difficult to accommodate to outlet  given the  54 price tag  this blender is well worth the money when entertaining and blending for groups  it gets the job done quickly and efficiently and crushes ice like magic  cleanup is easy   simply rinse the extremely sharp blade and air dry on counter and throw the pitcher in the dishwasher  because of the excellent top lock feature and no openings on pitcher base  little to no residue gets on the base  i love this blender  but if i had it to do all over again  i would bypass this model and order an all in one ninja blender that has the option of using smaller cups for individual drinks  our smoothie blending would take much less time if the area inside the pitcher cup was filled with more food liquid so that sides didn t need to be scraped of spinach  plus  we d have the added individual smoothie cups for our two children  allowing them to choose the ingredients inside  while they re battling over smoothie choices  my husband and i could enjoy blending frozen margaritas in a bigger pitcher  amazon   please stop pairing it with the  tritan nutri ninja cups   they re not compatible with this unit  bottom line  ninja packs a punch i ve never seen with other blenders  it s my new brand of choice 
blends nicely  but need to be cautious with blade 
we needed to replace our old blender and i didn t want to spend  300  on a blender  i was impressed the quality and the look of the blender as well as the top locking lid which seems to do a good job preventing any potential injuries  the only concern i have is that the blade is very long  sharp and you have to be careful when you clean it  i would not recommend leaving this in the bottom of the sink drain  also  if you do need to agitate whatever is in the blender  be careful not to stick your fingers in the pitcher and use the back of a wooden spoon or something similar 
dangerous   powerful
this is a great   powerful blender  but    warning  the blades are insanely dangerous to clean  if you don t have a dishwasher  you will slice open your fingers trying to clean it 
great smoothie maker
this blender works great for smoothies from frozen fruit and also homemade sherbet using frozen fruit  the only gripe i have about it is that it is a bit challenging to clean the blades and lid  first the blades are very sharp so you have to be very careful to not cut yourself and the lid has a lot of nooks and crannies  granted if you have a dishwasher this wouldn t be as much of an issue  overall the blender fits my needs very well and i did purchase the additional warranty from squaretrade so i am covered if anything happens in the next couple of years  which with daily use could easily happen 
because it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you    
i ve had a few blenders over the years  there was a krups that was a wedding present and lasted about 15 years followed by a much nicer breville that lasted maybe 2 years total  it was the cheaper of the two similar models  but out of the box  i could tell that the motor was under powered  especially at it s higher settings  it smelled smoky  even new and eventually it burned out  so  for it s replacement i landed here  didn t want to spend several hundred dollars  but went for wattage hp this time and it shows  confidence inspiring and i m sure will handle whatever i throw at it  i make smoothies almost every day with frozen fruit and it handles with ease  the blades are crazy sharp and stack up through the pitcher and seem to pull the contents down  so everything gets crushed blended  the pitcher locks to the base and the lid locks down on the pitcher and the motor won t run unless both are locked into place  i think this is a safety feature  because it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you got them in there  the blade stack lifts out  which makes cleaning easy  after about a month of moderate heavy use  i m impressed and happy  this is a very good blender
