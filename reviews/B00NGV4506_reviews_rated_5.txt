great blender  excellent customer service
i bought this blender exactly 1 year ago and i am now writing my review on it  i never write reviews but my experience with ninja s customer service was so exceptional that i felt compelled to write one  i ll start by saying the ninja is an excellent blender for  70  i blend frozen fruit with it every single day  it pulverizes everything into a smooth drink every time  about 1 week ago  for an unknown reason  my blender stopped working  when i went to turn it on the power button just started blinking instead  i wasn t sure what this meant so i emailed ninja  the representative was kind  attentive  and replied to my emails extremely promptly  sometimes within minutes   i let him know what happened  and all he asked me for was  1  the blender model number 2  where i purchased the blender and the approximate date of purchase 3  the warranty number  which happens to be just a 4 digit number engraved on the prongs which plug in to your electrical outlet  as soon as i gave him that information  he emailed me with a confirmation of shipment of a new pitcher along with a tracking number  the new pitcher arrived in 3 business days and my blender is working like new again  i never figured out what was wrong with the old pitcher or why it was preventing my blender from turning on   i love companies that provide exceptional customer service and i will never purchase another blender other than ninja  thank you ninja 
blade housing   operator error
to all the people giving this blender a poor review because they were harmed by blades  popping out   the blender lid locks in and the lid itself has a pouring spout that you are supposed to open to pour the drink or smoothie out with  personally i like how easy it is to remove the blades  makes for easy cleaning if you re making something more than a smoothie where you have to take the entire lid off  you can reach in  grab the head of the blade attachment and just easily pull the blade out  it s a fantastic product and you can t blame the product for a  design flaw  when it s simply operator error 
smoothie magic
there are some products that just change your life  i wanted to get in on the smoothie thing  and there simply is no other way to do it than with a blender  and no better blender to do it with  the blender is mostly plastic  but it doesn t feel cheap  it is very secure  it locks onto the base with a satisfying click  the lid locks down with a similar click  unless you have heard both clicks  the blender won t start  and good thing  the blades are very sharp  they are angled to create a vortex that instantly turns any fruits and vegetables inside into viscous liquid  i like that the spout has a lid that locks open so you can pour easily  the blades come out so that they can be cleaned easily  along with the inside of the decanter  i saw that another buyer was cut when the blades  flew out  during cleaning  i have looked carefully and my blade assembly does not appear to be capable of flight or even mild levitation  nonetheless i lift it out carefully  and if i am going to use the blender again i just rinse the blades  if i want the blades completely clean i use the dishwasher and not my hands  it has been a long time since i used a blender  i stopped because they sucked  old blenders leaked out the bottom  they were hard to clean  they had a ton of different buttons for blending speed with labels that required a thesaurus next to the cookbook  and however i parsed the gradations of perturbation between  emulsify  and  macerate   they didn t actually blend  what was at the bottom of the blender became angry and confused while whatever was in the top two thirds of the decanter remained beatifically serene  this blender has high  medium  and low settings  you can pulse  it is loud  which i take to be a feature and not a drawback  even more than my espresso machine  this blender is extremely effective at ending unwanted conversations  for particularly persistent interlocutors  use the pulse setting  neither my kids nor i particularly like fruits and vegetables and as a result we don t get nearly enough  and yet i can put in 10 bananas  two cartons of strawberries  two of blueberries  a bag of spinach  yes  spinach    a cup of plain greek yogurt  one interrupted conversation     and  ambrosia  the decanter is huge  and yet between the three of us we can and do empty it in one meal  yay 
amazing
i was a little skeptical on spending so much for a blender after reading some of the reviews that said they had troubles with equipment failure  i bought my ninja with a 4 year warranty for about  11 for peace of mind  i am glad i purchased the warranty  i would hate for anything to happen to my ninja  i am loving it so far  i ve had it for about a month and i make a smoothie about every other day  it has helped tremendously for weight loss and eating healthier  it s easy to hide some healthy foods in your smoothie and not even notice them  my favorite part of the ninja has to be how easy it is to set up and clean  in total  the ninja has 3 pieces   blender cup  blade and top   which makes it a quick clean  the blade comes out very easily and i can clean my ninja in about a minute and reassemble it in seconds  the fact that it s such an easy set up and quick cleaning process leads me to keep making more and more smoothies  i have found that peanut butter and some heavier foods do tend to stick to the side of the blender  but for the most part  everything gets blended down really nice  this is my best purchase of the summer  i used to have an old magic bullet and this blows it out of the water  i would highly recommend this to anybody who is on the fence of buying it 
great blender
i was concerned buying this blender because of some of the reviews about blades popping out  so when the blender came  i was sure to be very careful with the insides   to my relief there are many safety precautions on this blender to make sure that the blades stay on the inside  and once reading the instructions all my concerns went away  the locking lid and easy pour top make it so i don t need to remove the top when pouring smoothies  and when making salsa  the first thing i do when the top is removed is to take the blades out  easy to clean  and remove   i would purchase this again 
rivals the vitamix  at one fifth the cost
this is a great blender that rivals my much more expensive vitamix  ive taken a break from my vitamix 5200  which retails for 5 times the cost of this blender  to test this one out for a week  i love it  it gives my vitamix a run for the money  here are some observations  for chopping  this blender is impressive  it looks so much like a food processor that i tried chopping an onion  and got acceptable results  i would absolutely use this for that   the vitamix cant do this at all   for ice crushing  yes  yes  yes  yes  snow in blazingly fast time  sno cones  margaritas  whatever  this blender has that application covered  fantastic results  far better than the vitamix  for pulverizing  i thought it was very good  this was the area that the vitamix outshone the ninja  but i think the ninja did just fine  in my homemade jalapeo coleslaw dressing  the blender didnt quite get all the jalapeo pulverized  and there were little chunks still in the dressing  the ninja had a little trouble pulverizing 2 large bunches of kale  and i had to stop the blender a few times to use a scraper to push the leaves down  i also needed to add some water to aid in the blending  the leaves ended up rather smoothly pulverized  although i dont think they were quite as fine as in the vitamix  i love how the blades remove completely from the pitcher every single time  it not only makes it easier to scrape out all the food from the blender but also to get it perfectly clean  the vitamix always ends up with food stuck under the blades  and if its something like hummus  its really hard to get it clean  so the design on the blades in the ninja is brilliant  be careful  though  those blades are sharp  i managed to to slice my hands open on two separate occasions while trying to put them in or take them out of the dishwasher  seriously  having tried this blender  i cant see recommending that anyone spend the extra money for a vitamix  this is a really nice blender 
love it  this rascal will cut up and pulverize    
love it  this rascal will cut up and pulverize some frozen fruit quick  the pitcher connects quick to base with one hand also the pour tap will lock in the open position which is helpful  cleanup is fast and easy but careful with the blade device pick up and wash s l o w l y because it is very sharp  we had a nutribullet and the power base went bad so after some amazon shopping and a lot of reviews this arrived 2 days later and it is preferred over the previous device we had  just a little history at no extra charge      my wife and myself have chemo treatments and have found that it helps to self doctor if you can so we have a smoothie every morning consisting of cottage cheese and flax seed oil  cancer killers  and the taste is covered up with frozen fruit  almond milk and a good ripe banana  i added to let you know it is used daily with great results compared to infrequent use  hope this helps you make a decision 
i like it a bunch 
i used to use a food processor but  being we are a small family  i ve found this blender will do most everything my processor did  the quality feels great and it s easy to clean up  it s my favorite appliance these days 
this blender is a boss 
for the last couple of years  i have been making veggie smoothies  because you know  health  they are gross  but necessary for my health  in the past  it would take me at least 5 6 minutes for the smoothie to blend in my ol  trusty cuisinart  i would have to stir and stir before magically  everything was blended to perfection  i couldn t justify spending      on a high dollar blender  because it s a blender and i d prefer to spend my discretionary income on something more sustainable  like shoes  sarcasm   lately  my old blender has been heating up quickly and the motor gives off the  i am about to die  smell  so  off i went to the great internet highway in search of blender reviews  i stumbled upon this blender and read the review located near the top  which made me chuckle  i took the plunge and ordered it  wow  it blends like a freaking boss  it blended everything  avocado  spinach  bananas  blueberries  ice  other gross stuff  in seconds  no longer will i have to retreat to my spoon arsenal to get everything blended  this sucker blends like a champ and i love the pour spout  no green gross sad spinach stains on my counter  hooray  if you make smoothies and don t want to shell out big money  this blender is for you  for the money  it s a great deal 
powerful
wow  this blender is magnificent  these blades will cut anything  i bought this mostly to make pineapple hull juice and it easily works as described  now i use it all the time  besides its power  this blender is beautifully designed   it has all sorts of security features  so it s impossible to screw things up   for example  the lid is airtight and has a sensor click that will prevent the blender from turning on if it s open  there is also a  power  button you must turn on first  so there is no risk of blending anything by accident or getting startled  oh  and it has a very obvious way of attaching the body to the base  remember those blenders you had to try a million times to rotate the thing into the base  and still you weren t even sure it was securely attached   yea  not with the ninja  best purchase i ve made in a while  
great blender
i was contemplating breaking the bank and buy the vitamix which was like  400  so glad that i gave this one a try instead  not stating the obvious money saving  but unless you want to make soup without the stove or some crazy stuff  this blender is an excellent choice  we pulverized ice to make snow cone in no time  fruits and vegis gets blended into smoothly nicely  love the product  just be careful when cleaning the blades  they are very sharp 
i do love this thing
i do love this thing  this is my second one  it does the job of a vitimix for a fraction of the cost  the drawback with this particular model is that if a part breaks  the lid broke on my first one   replacement parts are hard to come by  and if you do want a replacement  it will be cheaper to buy the entire unit than the part  ninja has so many different versions of this thing and the parts are usually not interchangeable  but  aside from that  it works great 
best blender i ve used  
i love my ninja and absolutely cannot say enough about it  first off the power of it is amazing compared to all the other blenders i ve used such as oyester  black and decker  and a couple others  it s power is far stronger than all the others i ve used  but what s more amazing about it is that it s so much quieter than the others  it s a win  win situation for sure  this blender is also a food processor so the range of things that can be done with it is limitless  i enjoy juicing fruits and vegetables  but don t like typical juicers because it throws away all the pulp  and that is where the vast majority of nutrients are  with the ninja i get the best quality of fresh juices  smoothies  and protein drinks  i also really enjoy making my baby s food  and with the ninja it truly makes it a breeze  only the best for my little one  i have also made soup with it by blending my steamed veggies and then heated on the stove  the cleanup is so much easier than any other blender i ve used as well  i have been using my ninja for already 5 months and it works like a charm  this product is something i would recommend to anyone 
tons of room and power
after years of using and burning out cheap blenders i finally decided to upgrade to this quality blender and i am so  so glad i did  this has a very sturdy base which does not shift while blending  the carafe locks into place with ease and does not shift at all while blending either  the lid also locks into place and does not move while blending or pouring so there is no need to hold the top of the blender while it is going  the carafe holds a ton of stuff as well so fewer batches are needed when pureeing large recipes such as soup  the blades are super sharp and slide into place quickly and easily  they are not mounted to the bottom  similar to a food processor blade  so it is easiest to keep the lid on and pour through the pour hole on the corner and then remove the lid and blade unit for washing afterwards  contrary to other reviews it does not  pop out  for no reason  it does  however  fall out if you hold the unit upside down with the lid off  due to gravity   this is incredibly powerful as well  i very rarely need to process anything for more than 30 seconds no matter what it is  i puree soups and make smoothies and milkshakes all in under thirty seconds of blending  ice simply gets eaten up and there are no large chunks as i ve found with other brands and models  i also use this to puree food scraps for my worm composting unit and it fully purees a full carafe of eggplant peels  pepper insides  and celery ends  along with some water  into a v8 consistency in thirty seconds  overall  this is one of the best additions to my kitchen this year and worth every single penny  i highly  highly recommend it 
frozen fruit smoothies  no problem  smooth  ninja lives up to the hype 
smoothies are smooth  the unit works as advertized  appears to be an excellent product  i make my smoothies with frozen fruit which is very hard on blenders  this did a great job of converting the frozen fruit to a smooth consistency with no chunks or uncut pieces  it did not appear to strain  the question is  will it hold up to doing this day after day  i am betting the answer is yes  the design is quite good  i bought this unit to replace a breville that had died from hacking one too many bags of frozen strawberries  where breville makes a beefy brute force machine that hacks the fruit  the ninja is a smart design that cuts  as another commenter mentioned  the stacked blades are ingenious  the blades appear flimsy but their shape and sharpness does not expose them to forces that might harm them so they appear to be up to the task  the blade stack reaches all the way to the lid and this is one of the design innovations  by having a bearing in the lid it dramatically reduces the lateral torque on the main bearing thus allowing it to be much smaller  smart and efficient means less stress on components and less power is required  this is why i anticipate it will last longer despite weighing about 1 3rd of what my old breville boat anchor weighed  and it costs about 1 4 what it would to replace my breville with an equivalent model  designed for the internet age  light so shipping is in expensive  clever design so that it is exposed to less wear and tear  hope to be back in a year with a glowing report of long life  watch out for the blades  this is a rare case where razor sharp really means razor sharp handle with care or you will get cut  i suspect the lifetime of this blender is mostly dictated by how long the blades remain sharp 
must have blender recipe
2 oz white rum  don q cristal   1 oz coco lopez coconut cream  1 oz heavy cream  6 oz pineapple juice  1 cup of ice  1 spoonful of unsweetened coconut shreds  put aforementioned ingredients only in a ninja blender on medium blend for 11 seconds  garnish with a cherry  pineapple and cocktail umbrella and blaaaam  a perfect pina freakin colada brah
very good blender  
very good blender  it meets all expectations  with the cutting system of several blades allows to grind up to the ice  it is a robust blender  the use is easy and safe  it is not heavy  the jar is made of plastic  the lid has several opening systems that make it easy to use  the price benefit ratio is excellent  the packaging box is excellent  the seller made the shipment on time and the product was received on time  the product arrived in good condition 
worth the money  best blender i ve ever had 
i purchased this blender a few months ago  i was hesitant to spend the extra money for a ninja  since i usually purchase oster or black and decker blenders  but this was such a great decision  the blades going up the entire blender makes it so much easier for my smoothies to turn out consistent  especially since i use frozen fruits  and it blends rediculously fast  i make smoothies daily and i won t ever buy another brand  the price was seriously worth the splurge since i use it constantly 
and this looked good  i liked the description about the technology to    
i am a diehard vitamix person  but wanted a second blender to keep where i rent in the winter  i did not want to spend the money for another vitamix  and this looked good  i liked the description about the technology to crunch ice  because that was my biggest challenge with  regular  blenders  i use a lot of ice in my shakes  this blender is awesome  crunches the ice with ease  i probably will never get a vitamix again  as this is just as good but for a much better price 
this thing is a marvel of smart design and high quality precision manufacturing
this thing is a marvel of smart design and high quality precision manufacturing  they do not lie   fill it with ice cubes  run it and you get snow  because it has blades top to bottom this baby kicks out my breakfast smoothie in less than a minute  everything is good  the poor spout stays open when pouring by magnets or magic  i can tell but it stays up  yet never opens when blending  the pitcher locks onto the motor logically and effortlessly  clean up is easy  warm water and a drop of soap  run on high for a minute and rinse  done  it s even really easy to clean the base  sealed and wipe able all around  bummed i didn t get one of these long ago 
    month or two now and so far it s been perfect  i mostly use it to make smoothies but    
i ve been using this blender for a month or two now and so far it s been perfect  i mostly use it to make smoothies but have used it for other recipes as well  it s not the most powerful but it definitely gets the job done more than enough 
awesome
i have had a basic blender forever  i have wanted one of these for a long time  finally got it  this is a great blender  it isn t as loud   easy to assemble and clean  there were some reviews that mentioned the blade popped out when pouring the contents  the instructions clearly state leave the lid on  it holds the blade in place   and use the pouring spout  if contents too thick  remove lid  and blade  you can grab it safely from the top   and then pour out  just read the instructions before you use it     i love it  
i was looking for a vitamix alternative when i came    
i was looking for a vitamix alternative when i came across this blender  when i was trying to make crushed ice  it was so strong  it turned the ice into snow    the blades are also very sharp as i cut myself trying to clean the blender 
super   
i love this blender   it works great   other reviews stated that they got hurt using this blender or cleaning it  but if you close the lid properly and pour your shake into a cup through the top  secured  opening  then you will be just fine     and to clean it  just make sure you carefully take the blades out and wash that separately  if you follow these steps  then i promise that you will be injury free    definitely recommend this blender   
4 years and still going strong 
ive had my ninja for nearly four years and its still going strong  my average use is about 3 times week  it still blends great  ive never had the plastic break  ive never been cut by the blades  handle it with care and youll definitely get your moneys worth out of this investment 
great purchase
i never thought i d get excited over a blender  how did i live so long without this thing  it is well designed  easy to clean  i like the way the blades are held in place by the lid which makes them easy to remove  it is powerful  and with three blades  blends in a snap  wish i had purchased this years ago   
better than a normal blender
so much better than a normal blender  really gets everything into a liquid state quickly  easier to use and clean than a food processor  i use it for fresh fruit smoothies almost daily  no problem handling ice cubes or sticky ingredients like almond butter  just have to take care cleaning the removable center stem with six very sharp blades on it  it s taller than our blender was  so we actually can t push it up against the wall under the cabinet  so we store it with the blender jar removed 
great for smoothies 
after my old blender gave up the ghost  i got this  i was a little skeptical because of the plastic canister    but man is this thing awesome  i love the power and the design is perfect   the tall blade unit is easy to take out and clean  frozen smoothie stuff never gets stuck or needs stirring like my old blender  i didn t use my old blender as much as i would have liked  because it was such a hassle to get smoothies pureed to the right consistency  but my kids and i have been using this ninja every morning now for a couple of weeks 
this is the best blender i have had
i have used this now for a few months before writing a review  this is the best blender i have had  i can t afford the vitamix  so i bought this  i juice protein powder with frozen fruit almost everyday now  and only because this makes it so easy  blends ice water frozen fruit and powder so well  my husband loves me having it because we both benefits with the protein drinks  this is and affordable amazing blender 
can you really be in love with your blender   
yes  oh my yes   we are in love with our ninja blender  it will blend anything and it is so safe and easy to clean  the design is incredible  my husband blends smoothies with protein and frozen fruit and i used to dread the mess he made  the ninja comes apart in such a way that it is easy to clean and the blades lift out  i love the safety handle  you cannot take of the lid with the ninja in motion and trust me this is a good thing  the blades are so sharp  caution when cleaning blades  use a long dish washing brush to clean instead of a sponge or rag because of the sharpness and shape of the blades  don t leave them around small children 
adopt a ninja today 
it is as strong as it looks  that s for sure  i loved it  it s easy to clean  and i loved the safety feature  it also has a very soft lock system  and you only need to clean 3 things  the jug  the lid and the easily removable blades  there s no rubber blade plastic combo that takes hours to dry out or smells like baby vomit  no  just one long set of blades in hard plastic  omg   o i only had cheap blenders before this   a whole life of regret   
i love this blender
prior to ordering this ninja blender  i had been using another  it was heavy  glass  with a sort of vintage y vibe  after receiving and using the bl610  i don t know what took me so long  i love this blender  it s thorough  quick  and simple to use  i love that it blinks when it s plugged in but the lid isn t on correctly  super easy to clean  too  i ve been tons of things with this thing    from salsas to smoothies  my only advice would be to make sure to take the blade out before pouring  and be careful when hand washing  or just picking up  the blade 
margaritas forever
nothing worse than having your old blender die right in the middle of a batch of margaritas  my son had been singing the praise of his blender so i decided to order one up  glad i did  this thing creates incredible ice shavings which are excellent for making adult snow cones  as well as kiddy versions  and it also blends up mean margaritas with only a few seconds of blending  unit is well constructed and the features were well designed  easy pouring lid  locking top  clear controls with good sized buttons  easy grip handle   you won t be disappointed with this unit 
powerful blender  easy to use and clean    great for frozen drinks alcohol included  and smoothies 
i always wanted a powerful blender but all of them are so expensive  anyway  i bumped into this one and when i saw the reviews and the price       i said i can t say no to this  i am very happy with this  as soon as it arrived  2or 3 days maybe  i wash it  and the first thing i did was to do the ice test of course    hmmm  frozen strawberry margaritas  smothies  etc  well  with a little bit of noise  my dog ran away to my daughter s room  it passed the ice test  in seconds i had crushed ice  the next step was to instruct my daughter to never ever put her hands inside the container  no matter what  even if is not on  she looked at me with big open eyes    yes never  these are extra sharp blades  this morning i prepared my first smoothie  kale  carrots  pear  honey  banana and ice  i will not say the drink is delicious  but the blender did his job  in seconds all the fruits and veggies were crushed and blended  you will not be disappointed  go for it  easy to use  powerful and easy to clean 
ninja professional blender
this is without the best blender for the money period  in the past i have used from waring to kitchen aid and none of them crushed ice like this blender does  brought it for smoothies and protein drinks  consistency is like at a juice bar  well worth the money
five stars
makes great smoothies 
couldn t be happier
this is how much i love this blender    i included it when loading the car with a few belongings prior to evacuating for hurricane irma  it completely delivers on all its promises  there are multiple warnings about handling the blades  and they are indeed sharp  i don t have a dishwasher and hand washing the blade is painstaking  so i ve started filling the jar half up with soapy water and running it on low to swish clean the blades  works great 
what a joy 
my mother who lives with us needs to have her food pureed now  the blender we had could not handle pureeing many of our usual food items  after some research i decided to try the ninja professional blender  bl610   now most evenings when mom smells dinner cooking she can look forward to enjoying the same freshly prepared meal we are having  what a joy 
new generation design shows how far we ve come with a blender
sturdy  well designed blender that an grind anything without breaking a sweat  easier than anything i have seen prior to clean as you easily remove the blades and clean the inside very quickly  blades just wash off and that s good because they re sharp beyond description  and the design of the lid is genius  really like the way it locks into place on the base so you don t get partial engagement of the driving gear  nice design  good value for money 
frappe anyone  
the instructions are clear  turns ice into anything frosty that you can think of  do you have any idea how much starbucks charges for a coffee slush  it s paid for itself twice over already  i m in love  
great and very affordable 
first of all  this is my first blender that was manufactured later than the 70s  thanks mom for the hand me down osterizer   i am a product of the 80s  so yeah  obviously  much improved  i ve been excited to get up this past week to make my coffee smoothies before work  it is loud  i hope that my neighbor doesn t hear it downstairs  but i don t know if there is such thing as a blender that can quietly chop up ice  one of my cats watches me prep my smoothie but runs when i turn it on  and the other cat runs over to see what is making that noise  so it s tolerable for a non fraidy cat  i ve read reviews of complaints that the blade doesn t snap in and people have cut their hands  so i was nervous about that  but i sat down and read the instruction manual all the way through and it states it a bunch of times that the blade doesn t snap in and to lift it out before you pour with the lid off  so i ve paid very close attention to that  always be sure to read instructions  reviews have complained that the blender somehow broke within weeks of purchasing it  if you read the instructions  you ll see to register it within 10 days and they have a one year warranty  i highly recommend this blender and it s super affordable  my mom said her vitamix heats up whatever she puts in it  so i was worried my smoothie might come out warm  but it stays cold  maybe it s a better blender for 1 4 of the cost  pro tip  from mom   after using  fill the blender with warm water a little bit away from the top with a tiny amount of dish soap and run on high and it washes out the pitcher    
scary powerful and fast  intense you guys got it right
totally more intense powerful machine then my oster  really fast  great clever safety features to prevent injury from large blade  much better machine than expected  unfortunately it did not create a fine creamy shake  the shakes were coarse in texture with chips and pieces  no longer how long it ran  my oster took longer but produces a much much finer creamier result 
good blender   great for smoothies
so far so good  great for smoothies  having the blades along a shaft from bottom to top of pitcher seems to result in faster more efficient action when compared to models with blades only at the bottom  the pitcher is fairly large so if you only want to do one serving at a time you might consider similar models that include the option of individual serving containers  i prefer this size to make a full batch and keep second or third servings for another day or two without any apparent loss of freshness  you do need to be careful in handling the blade shaft especially when washing by hand or reassembling   the blades are very sharp 
arrived in perfect working order everything well packaged
arrived in perfect working order everything well packaged  i m 30 so i ve seen a lot of blenders over the years  this blender is one of the best i ve used and i ve only had it in my home for a few hours  first and fore most the lid locks down and may be trusted not to pop off  second  the blades are not locked in place making removal easy  third  and sadly the only flaw i don t recommend this blender for ice 
it s wonderful  does everything i ve ever asked it to 
i ve been putting this blender through its paces with a chutney recipe that requires blending fresh ginger  which my previous blender failed at miserably  wow  is this ninja ever a star  it also has several layers of very sharp blades  which cuts down on time  one of the best features is that if you don t have it securely put together it won t run  it s easy to use  easy to clean  blades and container are dishwasher friendly  and the lid usually only requires a soapy water rinse   and works like  well  a ninja  you will not go wrong with this blender 
works as advertised 
in addition to being the real deal  the unit has a number of safety features which will ensure family members do not get hurt or make another mess for me to clean up  the container has to be  screwed  into the base unti  the cap has to be locked in place  if one of these do not occur  the power light flashed indicating something is wrong  under this condition  the unit will not run  i like it 
no more hammers or mess
just got it today  to test it  i put in the ice from a whole 2 ice cube trays to see what it could do  15 seconds later  i had all the ice shavings  and more  than i needed  now  i ve to figure out a way to store the shavings so they re still crushed ice  but if don t  it ll only take 15 second  or less  to have the crushed ice you alway wanted    and now that s it s summer    how good does that sound 
way too much fun 
i can not explain how much i love my new blender  yes the blades are extremely sharp  and i would advise anyone to be careful with them  when washing them  other than that the motor is big and powerful and crushes anything within seconds  it is pretty loud so  i would advise you to make smoothies or whatever it is  when everyone is up  so that you do not disturb them 
powerful  fast and makes effortless perfect smoothies  
finally  i can make a quick easy smoothie   effortlessly  its powerful   does the job in seconds  i dont have to take the lid off 10 times during the process to shove the ice or fruit down lower towards the blades to make sure it all gets in  this pulls everything together on its own and you have a perfect smoothie within seconds to a minute  the blade isnt the typical small little attached piece on the bottom  its a long blade that is removeble   which makes the whole process much easier and blends evenly  no more shoving it all to the bottom   love it  easy to assemble  easy to clean  3 pieces   you can toss it right in the dishwasher when you are done 
a blender that lives up to the hype
since receiving it a week ago i ve used it to make smoothies every morning  not only does it quickly and efficiently pulverize ice  greens  and frozen fruit in moments but it mixes ingredients well   no chunks of protein powder or almond butter left untouched  the pour spout on the lid is key to easy transfer to your glass  it completely eliminates the risk of smoothie ending up all over the counter  it s also really easy to clean  i take the blades out immediately after use and rinse them clean in seconds  sometimes i leave the rest to soak during the day with some soapy water and when i get home later in the day it just needs a rinse and any sticky residue washes away easily  can t recommend this blender enough 
very happy 
we use this mixer for smoothies   love it  this beats any standard blender  just be sure to clean up right after your done and it s very easy to keep clean  the super sharp blades slice frozen fruit   ice   bolts  just kidding    but in any case  the blender is awesome  this is our second one  we used to own an older model and the only reason we needed a new one was the old one fell off the counter and broke the container  manufactured solid and with good quality parts 
amazing

recommended
with three sets of blades  not just one set on the bottom  this blender does a nice job making smoothies  the lid locks on to the pitcher and the pitcher locks onto the base  remember the old days when we would keep our hand on the lid when blending  just in case  no need here  there are three power settings  low  medium  and high  it also has pulse  for cleaning  the center piece with the blades comes out easily  i put the pitcher  blades  and lid in the dishwasher  we ve been using this for six months now and we re very pleased 
simple professional grade blender with affordable price
for the price  this is no doubt an excellent blender  i love to blend smoothies as meal substitute  the multi blades feature is great  all i have to do is stuff in all the ingredients and turn it on  30 seconds later i will have my finely blended smoothies ready  no more problem with ingredients stuck in the middle  some people mention in the review that they have problem with the detachable blade  but i can only think of one scenario that would cause such problem  which is press the release button while the blender is blending  the blender has a locking mechanism on the lid  the blender cannot start without the lid close and locked  just need to be careful not to unlock the lid while blending  and make sure the lid is secured before start  i personally love the removable blade  it is so easy to clean and dry  i had so much problem with my old blender when the blade got dirty  but not anymore  this blender design is very well thought  practical  powerful  and easy to maintain  with this affordable price and performance of a professional blender  you just cannot ask for more 
this is the blender you ve been looking for 
this is the blender i was looking for  i wanted something better than the  25 35 oster  hamilton beach or black   decker  but i didn t want or need the expensive breville or vitamix  it s multi blade spindle makes quick work of fruit or ice  blending everything completely  an extremely simple control panel   low  medium and high  plus pulse   what more could anyone want  do be warned  the blades are crazy sharp   but i clean mine the way i ve cleaned every blender i ve ever owned   adding a few drops of dish soap and some warm or hot water to the blender jar  run it for a few seconds and rinse it out  only handle the blade spindle by the very top and you will never lose another drop of blood 
this thing is great  it rips up frozen fruit like nothing
man  this thing is great  it rips up frozen fruit like nothing  used to have to warm up the frozen fruit before blending  no such problem now 
best bang for your buck
i purchased this due to the price point and good reviews in hopes that it performed just as good as the  350  500 blenders  i have to say that it has outdone itself proving that it takes little to no effort blending up my smoothies on a daily basis  i would definitely recommend this compared to the more expensive blenders  take the rest of the money that you save after buying this to purchase other needed appliances 
ice beware   
     this will conquer you  i love this blender  the 9cup capacity is far more practical than the lesser 6 cup blender distant cousins  it will be perfect for margarita time  three blades to blend whatever the hell you shove down in there  the lid locks into place as does the pitcher  no more blender mishaps with the ill fitting  flimsy lids     a solid blender that makes a fine addition to all the kitchen gadgets that one needs for a good time 
my key to healthier eating  love this blender  incredible with frozen fruit and invigor8 protein  health mix 
so happy i chose this blender  i had an older osterizer blender and a nutribullet    the osterizer was ancient and started leaking at the bottom by the blade  wouldn t blend my smoothies without frequent stiring  and i hated unscrewing the pieces to clean it  the nutribullet needed to be stirred to blend as well  and was even worse  i had issues with leaking with it as well  i personally want my smoothies a smoothie consistency not a watery drink  this blender is perfect for me  it has a lot of great features and was obviously made with convenience in mind at every step  we are protein  health shake junkies  for our smoothies we mix invigor8 smoothie powder in with water  frozen fruits  and vanilla yogurt  these smoothies taste like desert and the ability to make them thicker in a blender like this is incredible  i am one of those people that never outgrew the issue with chunks and weird textures in my food  this blender successfully blended my thick smoothie to perfection  for those who haven t tried it  buy some invigor8 and use it in smoothies with this blender    they have chocolate and vanilla  so good and extremely healthy  if you like chocolate    the brownie invigor8 mix with frozen banana  a little frozen strawberry  some water  and some vanilla yogurt literally tastes like a banana split  this blender is my key to healthier eating and i am in love 
efficient  easy to clean  powerful  loud
this performs like new even though it s refurbished  the three tiers of blades are excellent for large volume blending  the unit is large but not bulky  the cord wrap area on the back of the motor housing is very convenient  i enjoy how everything locks into place   the blending container onto the base and the lid onto the container  it s very easy to clean because the blades come out all at once easily without any weird holes or needing to root around the bottom of a blender with a sharp object  i imagine there is no quiet blender but being that this one is powerful  it s ridiculously loud 
easy to clean  powerful and efficient at blending
there are 5 thing i love in particular about this unit compared to other blenders that i ve used before  1  fantastic power that ll cut through anything frozen that i toss in 2  the three pairs of blades at low  middle and high heights inside completely eliminates the need to use a spoon halfway through blending to push down a top layer of un blended material  this immensely adds to the speed at which i can blend  3  the volume of 72oz is very generous and allows me to better make a gallon pitcher of watermelon juice for example 4  the plastic construction is very durable and eliminates the need for any gaskets that can potentiate leaks like is glass blenders  the simplicity of the removable blade  which makes it easier to replace if it were to break or wear down  and a single lid also makes this very easy to clean  just put in some water and soap  run the blender for a few seconds  and rinse out after  5  small detail  but i very much appreciate that there is a way to wrap to cord  like on a vacuum cleaner  on the back side  instead of on the bottom or not at all   this helps reduce its footprint on my counter top where i like to keep it 
will easily stand up to the vitamix
yes  this is the blender of all blenders  easy to clean  easy to set up  easy to pour  easy to turn on and use  forget the vitamix because this blender is just as good  trust me  my aunt has a vitamix and this is exactly the same for a small fraction of the price   warning  the blade in the center is not fixed onto the blender jar  it it loose so be careful when you open and reach in there  i read another review that said a man was cut and he blamed the blender  sorry  no  the blade won t  jump out  at you but it is loose  with that being said  yes  yes to this blender  you need it  you ll regret not getting it  thick plastic jar  click release lid  pour spout  3 settings  low  med  high   measurements on jar and a twist lock to secure jar to base  this blender is awesome at chopping ice  making dough  salsa  smoothies and iced coffee   get this today
