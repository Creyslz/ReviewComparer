  sounds nice  clear
after using these for 3 months now  and with me getting constant emails about writing a review for this  here is basically what i think of the headphones  pros    sounds nice  clear  and crisp    the white headphones are beautiful  it s not a boring dull white  but a nice cool white  neutral    volume and mic does not work  never worked since day one  cons    after wearing the headphones for 2 hours  on volume 5 on my phone  my ears  not the inside but the outside  gets red and starts hurting a lot  has been happening since day one    cushions of the headphones feel like they have nothing in them  that it s just the fabric and barely any ear support    cushions are also very small  looks to be made with people who have small ears in mind really  conclusion  get these headphones if you have small ears  and don t mind if the mic and volume control not working  if you have average ears  your ears are most likely going to get uncomfortable with these headphones around the same two hour mark  and i suggest looking at other headphones to get 
the sound was clear with any other headphones and they were comfortable to wear
when i got these headphones  initially one of the ear pieces was not working  but over time  it went away  they are also not completely folding compatible  the way the bridge of the headphones is made prevents them from folding all the way  the sound was clear with any other headphones and they were comfortable to wear  but my ears did hurt after wearing them for long periods of time  i had these headphones for three months until the part that connected the earpiece to the frame broke because they were simply made out of plastic  be mindful of what you are going to get based on what you are paying for  i decided to buy a different set of headphones the second time 
pretty colour
beautiful colour  edgy  moves around  foldable  however a little small for my ears so a bit of discomfort after on for a long time  can give to my teen niece soon  
the sound coming from them is nice 
they are too big  i dont consider myself to have an extremely small head  but they are big with no way to adjust them smaller  the sound coming from them is nice 
not the right choice for me 
i m a bit disappointed  the reviews were good but i found them uncomfortable on my ears  maybe full size over ear headphones would have been a better choice for me   there was quite a bit of static and the volume faded in and out when i moved 
mostly ok   
fairly decent for the price  the cord is a bit short though  i don t care much for the volume control  very hard to manage 
uncomfortable  weird proportions
the band is too big  the pads ear pieces are too small and at a uncomfortable angle  all the pressure ends up on the top of my ear   the sounds seems okay 
its a okay product 
these are good but they tend to skip songs or stop the song for no reason if i accidently brush my finger against the ear jack on my phone or walk around and the cord swings
