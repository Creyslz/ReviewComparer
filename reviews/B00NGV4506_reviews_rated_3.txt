good for this price point   
i purchased the ninja last week when i remembered i didn t have a blender at our vacation home  i needed something in a hurry and didn t have time to shop  i am using it for my green smoothies  spinach kale  water  and some frozen fruit   i put the spinach kale and water in the ninja then liquify before adding the frozen fruit  ending up with a grainy drink with a shake like thickness  i can temporarily live with the graininess  though this may be a problem for some  the blender container is large enough that i can make a double serving with no problem  the blade is scary  but i handle it with the utmost care and so far there have been no mishaps  the lid  container  and blade are extremely lightweight plastic and do not seem sturdy  they are dishwasher safe  making clean up quick and easy  but i ve noticed the hollow handle retains internal moisture that does not dry in the course of the day  might lead to bacterial growth    overall this does not come anywhere close to the high end blender i have at home  i don t expect this blender to last very long  it arrived within 48 hours through amazon prime  was safely packaged  and as described  i feel i received what i would expect at this price point  but have already decided to purchase a nicer blender before our next visit 
it s ok  wouldn t get again 
my beloved  and expensive  breville recently broke  and after much researching  decided to get this as a replacement  the pitcher definitely feels and sounds cheap thin like it wants to break  i swear every time i use it  the ice cubes are going to crack it  i use it mostly for protein powder shakes after the gym  unfortunately the square shape means that powder gets in the corners and stays there  also  despite using every possible setting  i can t get it to blend the ice well  i always feel the need to the shake a bit as bigger ice chips always remain  i always hand wash  which is easy   yay  this immediately after using and after just a month  condensation is collecting in the handle  not cool  i do like the spout opening in the lid  which ensures that big blobs of shake or smoothie don t make messes as you pour  this is an ok blender  but feels like it wants to break and i m not impressed with its functionality  prob wouldn t buy again 
just ok
it worked well for the first few months  but then the blades became very dull  we have a green smoothie every morning with lots of vegetables  the smoothies were becoming more and more  chunky  and hard to get through even a huge smoothie straw  i tried to get a replacement part but there are none for this model  since we realized that we are very committed to daily green smoothies  we ended up buying a vitamix and wow   what a huge difference  i never knew that you didn t have to  chew  a green smoothie   the ninja never blended our smoothies to a puree consistency  the ninja is fine for some things  but it doesn t compare to a vitamix 
not good with chia flax seeds
after my last blender died  everyone recommended a ninja  i just made my first shake and it unfortunately doesn t grind up blend chia or flax seeds  the spinach and ice were blended fine  and it looks to be sturdy and built well  if you re not going to be adding any seeds or small items like that i imagine you ll be fine  but i believe the tower blades don t catch them the same way a traditionally structured blender does 
it blends  but i wouldn t buy it again
i saw several reviews of this blender accompanied by pictures of lacerations  i thought to myself   i ve been using food processors and other kitchen tools that have sharp  removable blades for years with no problems      well  i have managed to avoid any injuries  however i have more sympathy for those people than i did before for the following two reasons  1  the three tiers of blades mean that there is no safe way to dry this without blades sticking up in the air  unlike a knife or a food processor blade where you can lay it flat   standing it upright the way it sits in the carafe will make it prone to tipping over  2  the top part where you must hold the blade is small  tapered  and difficult to grip firmly with wet hands  my other complaint is that because of the three tiered blade assembly  it is impossible to safely push things down into the blender  i make smoothies five days a week and the kale that i used to just press down to the bottom so that other ingredients would fit  i now have to blend for a moment to make room  not a huge chore  but it slows me down  i don t love the locking lid and i fear the plastic moving parts will break before the blender wears out  but i ve been using this several days a week for five months and that s still working fine  bottom line  it blends reliably  i m not going to replace it  but i wouldn t buy it again 
not suitable for all uses
this blender is absolutely excellent if you exclusively use it to blend whole pieces of fruit and veggies  personally i make a lot of smoothies with items such as yogurt and protein powder added in  the trouble is it has this very long three bladed pillar that extends almost all the way to the lid from the bottom  if you are trying to add in a powder or something like yogurt  it catches on all the blades  which means that unless you planned to fill the blender all the way to the top  that stuff won t make it into your smoothie and will instead stick and you have to scrape it in and blend again  also it s ridiculously powerful even on the low setting  which again isn t good if you only want to make less than maximum capacity  since it splatters everywhere and you either lose a lot  or have to sit there and scrape it all out with a spatula  overall it s just a lot of trouble unless you are using it to full capacity every time
