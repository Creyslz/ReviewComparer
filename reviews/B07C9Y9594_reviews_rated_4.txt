good sound   low cost   buy
i purchased the  dodocool  bluetooth headphones and have been using them for about 5 days now  the are an excellent choice  especially for the lower cost  these headphone are the earbud kind that come with three different size ear cups as well as with little arm extensions that help secure them in your ear  you do not feel these little arm extensions in any way  the ear cups provide adequate ambient noise isolation once you find the right size   most comfortable ear cup size for you  sound is  good  bass is a little muddled  i use them with spotify on an android which allows me to equalize the sound to my liking  i was able to clean up the bass somewhat via the equalizer  the instruction manual  photo attached  is somewhat brief and will likely confuse someone who is not familiar with common ways these type of bluetooth devices are paired with phones  note that it would not pair with a pc bluetooth transmitter that you hook up to your pc audio jack  not really needed by me  but thought i would try  i wouldn t expect any issues with connecting to a phone at all  i found that while walking around with these in my ears  there was quite a bit of sound noise transmitted through the cable connecting the two ear buds  i can minimize this somewhat by positioning the cable inside the collar of my shirt  but the thunk bump thunk sound when the cable hits your collar is somewhat distracting and might be a factor if jogging with these  don t know if this is an issue with all types of these type of headphones or not  the cable noise and slight instructions cause me to give up one start  however  i do really like these ear buds  with their good sound and low cost  they are a good buy  if i want perfect  i would expect to pay triple or more
