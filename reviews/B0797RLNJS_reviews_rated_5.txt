mini umbrella that is very good for what it is
just used this for the first time in the rain and it is extremely good for what it is  a pocket umbrella  this is significantly shorter than a typical  travel  umbrella  it has a very short handle with no auto open close  it has just six spokes rather than the eight spokes you typically see in travel umbrellas  but the length of the spokes is the same as the larger travel size umbrellas  so it gives you nearly as much coverage  it is so short  it fits diagonally in the back pocket of my dockers pants and i barely notice it most of the time  since i do a lot of walking outside between buildings when i m at work  i carry one of these in my pocket every day during the rainy season as a  backup  for the larger umbrellas in my car and at my desk  i ve used this in the rain  and it gets the job done when i forget to bring a bigger umbrella with me 
ready for rain  
i absolutely love this little convenient compact umbrella  the color came and although it was a little bit different than what i expected i love the color even more  i like the fact that it fits perfectly in my bag not taking up much room so i can carry it everywhere with me because we never know when we re going to get that unexpected rainfall  it was definitely a lot more sturdy than what i expected easy to use and definitely easy to put back away when done  hands down one of the better compact umbrellas that i ve used   i m going to purchase another one for my friend and another one for my son so that he can put in his backpack for school these are great for gifts and reasonably priced and comes in so many different colors so you could almost put one in every purse  not that i would   lol
compact and handy
im loving this umbrella  its so small that i can fit it down in my purse so i have an umbrella when needed  you never know when you will need an umbrella in georgia  the outside is kind of a shiny black material the repels water  the inside had a picture of a beautiful flower  this umbrella is very easy to fold back up for storage 
light and pretty easy to use
this is definitely going in my kayaking back pack  it s small  light and pretty easy to use  i was able to take it out and use it right away and was surprised at how much coverage it gave me  it covers a much as a full size umbrella without the bulk  the little nobs you push in to shorten the handle were easy for me to use  but might be a little tougher for a younger child  all in all  price was great and hopefully i don t need to use it too much this summer  but at least it doesn t take up much space so i can have it with me all the time 
pretty and easily compacted
i got this because i will be going out of the country and want to be prepared but need room in my baggage  it s a great size and even after testing it out i was able to get it back in the little slip cover  which i normally never can do  the material is different than any other umbrella i ve ever had  it think it is because you don t want light to get through since the pretty flower is on the underside  so it s a shiny black on the outer portion and beads the water well  i was playing with the little one and it s a great size for him    im able to carry him and we are both covered even with it being the smaller travel size 
i must say i loved the to the core
yey   finally i can see it   it arrived early in the morning but was not at home so was exited to see it   thanks fidus for bringing out lovely product in the market   i don t understand why people get upset about its size of the product  don t you guys read the feature or description of the product before you click on add to the cart  i must say i loved the to the core  never seen this type of umbrella which has design inside which we can see it rather than others    it s perfect as described ultra light weighted  small and compact which can fit to any size of handbag and does not occupy much space  it is easy to open and close without struggle  i truly recommend this product who really likes to carry umbrella in summer form sun protection and dose not want to carry much weight of it on shoulders  
surprisingly happy
its a mini umbrella  so dont expect everything from it  but im honestly quite happy with it  its small  easy to stash in my bag to always haveon hand  im in love with the rubber  velcro free closure  it doesnt catch on things in my bag as much as a normal mini umbrella  ive used it several times during particularly bad  windy storms  its turnes inside out several times   usually in situations where i cant take my time to sort it out and fix it  despite my rushing to forcibly cram it down  its not broken at all  i still have no problems using it 
i would like to stock up on these mini umbrellas and keep    
i purchased this mini umbrella for my daughter and she loves it  it is small and compact yet works well  it can fit anywhere  a book bag  a purse  or even in a large pocket  it comes in a variety of colors and has an underlining of a thick plastic material  i would like to stock up on these mini umbrellas and keep them stashed for a rainy day  pun intended  
size  weight  color and the price was good 
this little umbrella came in the mail the other day  it was purchased to go on my kayak and thats why i needed one light weight and a special color  so i got forest green to blend in with everything around me just in case a shower comes up while im fishing  dont like scaring the fish off with bright color umbrellas  it feels and looks rugged enough to take on any showers im willing to ride out while on the water  would be perfect for any car umbrella if thats what your looking for  but this one stay in my kayak from now own  thanks

flexible and tough
this umbrella is very easy to carry  it is perfectly suitable for one person and can easily fit in my office bag  it is very lightweight  folded umbrella s length is almost the size of one palm  it is windproof and it will dry very quickly  i can use it on sunny days  too  it is made with an aluminum so it is very lightweight and tough  it has a thick band and a flexible button for lock the umbrella  it also helps to protect against uv rays

great for a purse car
this is a really nice purse car umbrella  its small when it s closed   and doesn t use a velcro closure  it has a thick rubber band that wraps around  the outer shell is more of a plastic  but the inner feels more like a traditional umbrella fabric  inner print is high quality  note that this is a  manual  umbrella   not a push a button to open
