lag when using these to watch shows  average sound
amazon reviews used to be helpful  i m learning to start tempering them with a good dose of skepticism  apparently terms like  fantastic    amazing   and  phenomenal  are used loosely and to cover a wide range of very average products  first off  for the money these are decent headphones  they aren t anywhere close to better headphones in sound quality or build quality  but they aren t close to the price either  my first and main issue with them is that there is noticeable lag between the show and the sound through these headphones  any lag in sound while watching a show makes them unusable in my opinion  for music  not a big deal at all of course  second  the sound through these headphones is very average  there is no deep bass  i ve used much smaller headphones  not over ear  and not earbuds  that have much better low range  i have a pair of over ear headphones i purchased on amazon for under  100 that have fantastic  truly fantastic  not fantastic for  35  sound  clarity  and low range  there is some noticeable fuzz static while listening to shows  though not enough that it really bothers me  let s stop giving 5 star  better than my bose  not a fanboy   glowing reviews to average products  it doesn t help anyone who needs honest opinions about products  lastly  mine only came with an audio cable and a usb cable  it did not include a power adapter  which it sounded like it should from the manual when it tells me to insert the charger into a standard outlet  for  35  this is an ok set of headphones  i wouldn t buy them again if the lag issue during shows is normal 
decent
i ve had them for a week now and have used them just about everyday  i think i ve got a good handle on them  these headphones aren t the worst i ve ever used but they definitely aren t the best  i ve got a pretty big head and they are able to be adjusted to fit my big dome quite comfortably  they feel like they re decently made  some headphones that are this style feel like they ll break in half when you put them over your head  luckily these don t feel that flimsy   but i still don t want to toss them around too much  i wear them in 2 situations  1 in which they perform exceptionally and another where they leave some to be desired  situation 1   around the house after work when i listen to podcasts  the perform very well  the voice of the podcasters are clear and rich  the ability to leave my phone stationary charging up and still use headphones is clutch  situation 2   at the gym  listening to music  the bass boost in these headphones is too much for my musical interests   mostly metal music  the low end of these headphones tends to muddy the guitars and midrange sounds  if you listen to edm or something similar they tend to sound better with this style of music  if you listen to heavy metal  i d pass on these  my last complaint is that these headphones keep my head hot while i m at the gym because the ear coverings are so large  i ll get so hot that i ll have to take them off and wipe off my disgustingly sweaty head  so there s that  what else is included  there s a carrying bag that s made from a similar material as the crown royal bags  if you re familiar with those  there s a micro usb cable and a 3 5mm audio cable  both about 4 feet long  i included a dollar in my pictures for scale    update   after my review i was contacted by customer support regarding my displeasure with the headphones  they offered 3 potential solutions  1  send a different set of the same model  2  a similar model they suggested  3  or offered to send me a model of my choosing  i know some people like these poofy headphones but they ve never impressed me so i went with option 3 and chose the mpow cheetah headphones and have been really impressed with them  i d give them a solid 7 10 on audio quality  there are certainly limitations regarding audio quality when it comes to ear bud style headphones but these definitely play heavy metal in an extremely satisfactory way  not too bassy  pretty clear highs and mids  i like that i m able to turn the volume up beyond what my phone suggests because c mon  there s a reason i can t hear in the first place  listening to my headphones too loud    cantstopwontstop   the buttons feel solid and have already taken quite a bit of use  because i m always skipping songs  i think everybody does though  so i m good there  the only thing that s a little counterintuitive  at least to me  regarding the buttons is that to change to the next song you have to click the volume down button  that just takes some getting used to but is hardly a negative  like most ear buds  after extended use they start to cause some discomfort in the ear  but that s not a negative as much as it s an indication to rejoin the rest of the world  if anything it s a feature  overall i ve been very impressed with the mpow cheetahs  i d give them 5 5  i stopped using the original headphones entirely  actually  the battery lasts a couple of days before needing to be recharged  though  to be honest i ll usually proactively charge it after 3 or 4 days  it s been a while since i got these so i can t remember if it came with a micro usb cable or not  i don t seem to have an extra anywhere though  honestly i m glad  i ve got so many already i m glad i don t have another  but it is a micro usb slot  tl dr anyway  to wrap this up  i do not recommend the mpow poofy over ear headphones initially reviewed  i highly recommend the mpow cheetahs  though  5 5 
used at the gym
this headphone is plastic construction  it does fit an adult female with small ears rather snuggly and securely  it is not adjustable  due to plastic construction  this headset should be handled carefully as trying to over extend will most likely cause cracking or worse  the interior padding on top of head makes it quite comfortable but by no means do i think it will prevent it from breakage if forced  the ear pads are comfortable  the bluetooth easily linked to my iphone 6p  it took a bit to connect to an ipod nano  but once connected it now easily pairs  at local gym  it does connect to the bluetooth equipment but it can take some doing each time to pair  the range is decent  30 40 feet  but once out of range  it disconnects and must be paired again  in terms of sound  using it for standard tv on gym equipment the sound is fair  using it with my apple device music the sound is good  it can feel and sound like being in a vacuum which probably is due to the headset being tight on the head ears  the max volume is not very loud  when pairing to phone  ipod and television each device itself must be set on the loudest setting  on gym equipment  the volume is very low even with equipment at max volume and headset at max volume  the volume control doesn t really seem to work  i also own a bose headset and the sound quality of bose is amazing  mpow is not amazing  not even close  again  this was purchased under  30 for the sole intention of being a headset to use at the gym  it doesn t flop on head  is secure and serves the purpose it was intended for  i would not recommend this for anyone that wants a headset to listen to music or surround sound television 
looks amazing  sounds meh 
so  i ve had these for almost two months now  and figured i had to let others know what the real deal is  pros    style  these look amazing  seriously  i get compliments almost every day when i wear them out  people keep asking me if they re beats  clearly  they ve never seen beats before lol   comfort  these are surprisingly comfortable  i have larger ears  and these fit very comfortably around them  sure there s slight discomfort at times and some sweating  but that s to be expected with over ear  i can confidently say that i can wear these for 4 hours and not really need to take them off once   multi device support  so convenient to connect my phone and my laptop to these at the same time so i don t have to keep switching back and forth    navigation  it s incredibly easy to use  and connecting is a breeze  once you re connected  you never have to worry about it and can cycle through everything without touching what these are connected to  the clickable buttons are perfect for not guessing what button you re using  cons    range  these are absolutely horrible sometimes with regards to range  i ll have my phone in my pocket  and sometimes the sound will go out while i m walking  i had a pair of bluedio turbine s before this  and they enabled me to leave my phone in my bedroom and go to my kitchen without any problem  yes even with walls in the way   these however  can barely get through a song when i walk more than 7 feet away  disgraceful    sound quality  let me start off by saying these aren t bad on sound persay  however  my personal tastes just weren t met  if you re a hip hop or r b lover  these aren t the headphones for you  the bass on my bluedio s wasn t the greatest but it did the trick  these however  sound like the bass is happening two rooms away from you  very disappointing  i never tested quality with the aux cable  because let s be real  these are bluetooth headphones  if i wanted wired headphones  i would ve bought some    phone calls  while everyone could hear me fine  there was always a strange clicking noise in the background according to those on the other side  apparently it got really annoying at times  i never had trouble hearing other people  otherwise  answering and hanging up we re a breeze    battery life  i charged my bluedio s maybe once every week  granted  i m a heavier than average user  but these headphones barely lasted two days  really frustrating when i have to keep them plugged in all the time  overall  you re getting what you pay for  however  compared to others of the same price  this sacrifices a lot just for minor improvements in aesthetics and comfort  if only these had more bass in them and a longer battery life  i think i d be happier  for now  to the junk drawer you go  update 03 2018  i have received extremely courteous and helpful customer service from this product s manufacturer  patozon  they promptly contacted me after my review was posted  listened to my concerns  and provided me with a replacement product  mpow h1   while the mpow h1 was definitely better than the mpow 059  it still had some similar issues while lacking the sleekness in design  all in all  i am extremely impressed with the customer service i received from patozon  and will definitely consider them for my future purchases  however  as my original review was tied to the product and not the company  my stars remain the same 
comfy with caveats    
the bad  if you have a large head  7 3 4  hat size   this item is not for you  the muffs are comfy but the headband will most likely be too tight atop your head  the ample padding on the band  which is firm and not soft  the makes contact with the top of your head adds to the band being too tight  also   the controls  functions  for the headset are difficult to see  no matter which color headset ordered  the symbols controls markings blend in with the background of the headset  these should either be dimpled to distinguished by touch and or be a contrasting color  i e  red on black  green on black  white on black  instead of a very dull gray on black  now  most of the time you ll use the controls when wearing the headset  but there will be times you ll use these functions when not wearing the headset  i e  pairing  charging  volume control  putting sound on hold  etc   lastly  because you can t distinguish volume controls or channel selection by touch  you could accidentally change the station while meaning to minimize volume  the good  and this applies to 90   of the population   if the control issues i mentioned don t bother you  you ll like these headphones  they are comfy and has good sound  but no noise cancellation no matter how high you have the volume set to your favorite song or video   bottom line  these headphones are going back to amazon for the reasons i stated  but i think i m in the minority  most will like these headphones  i will say that these are not good to use when doing cardio  perspiration accumulates quickly on your ears due to the muffs and also where the headband makes contact on your head  making it both frequent and sometimes difficult to wipe away sweat during a workout  earbuds are better  
mediocre headphones or an adequate headset  can t be both 
these headphones are comfortable enough to wear for an hour or two  but not much longer   and though the sound quality leaves  much  to be desired  you get what you pay for where audio gear is concerned  bluetooth connectivity works with no trouble  and the option of pairing with multiple devices is appreciated  the microphone is sufficient for voice chatting  1ch 16bit 8000hz  aka telephone quality  my main complaint with these headphones is the sound quality change that happens while you re using the mic  while using them as merely headphones  you can get readonably clear  2ch 16bit 44100hz  aka cd quality  audio playback   the speakers themselves sound awfully tinny and weak  but at least the playback quality is acceptable  however  as soon as you activate the microphone  the quality drops significantly  to 1ch 16bit 8000hz  aka telephone quality  to match the microphone   imagine that instead of listening to your favorite track on a normal pair of headphones  you re listening to it through your phone speaker  transmitted from your friend who s holding their phone up to their laptop speakers   it s awful  honestly  you re better off spending more money on better gear  if you have the option   but if you don t  just know that you can either use this set as mediocre headphones  or an adequate headset for voice chat   never both at the same time  if you like to listen to music while your game and wan to still leave your mic active  you should look for a different product 
not bad  but certainly not great
just charged these up and paired with my headphones  first impression  not bad  but certainly not great  fit seems decent  but then again i ve only had them on for 15 minutes so far  sound seems muffled  especially at low volume  keeping phone volume high and lowering volume on headphone seems a little better than the other way around  also seems better when i remind myself i only paid  34 for these  and my primary use will be for workouts at the gym or on my bike trainer  if you re after good music quality  spend more    if your primary use will be listening to the music you love  spend a lot more     these will spend a lot of time banging around in my gym bag and just generally being abused  for my intended use these should work well  update   3 days later  muffed sound continues to bother me  these sound better at higher volumes  but i like to listen quietly  not a great experience with these  i think they re going to go back 
good and bad   
i purchased these headphones at the beginning of october and absolutely loved them  they sound awesome and they re pretty good at blocking out background noise  the bluetooth connection has been a little iffy since i got them so i have just went to using the aux cable cord when this happens  used the bluetooth just fine for the last couple of days with no issues until i decided to charge it this morning since it was not connecting or reacting to pushing buttons  the red light did not come on  will turn on when charging  and the side where you plug it in to charge got really hot  trying to find any kind of online support from mpow is impossible and now my  wireless  headphones are back to being plain old plug in headphones  they still sound awesome  but now i have to buy a longer aux cord so i can do work at my computer without having to sit so close to the screen  time to find a different pair of wireless headphones     
good as a bad     but the bad wins 
i love these headphones  they re comfortable  good looking and the sound is great  unfortunately  after about a month now  they tend to short out randomly  they ll shut off  happening more frequently all the time  and as soon as i plug them in  i can restart it  it s really unacceptable  i d buy them again  or trade them in  but i m not happy with this particular set 
like you d expect from almost any very cheap cans
i m starting to suspect that virtually all bluetooth headphone   earbud products in existence have flat frequency response  too much bass  and muddy highs  these cans certainly aren t doing anything to convince me otherwise  passive noise isolation is almost nonexistent  like you d expect from almost any very cheap cans  with the sound off  i can can run my fingernails lightly over the wall behind me and still hear it quite clearly  total noise attenuation might be 4db  possibly less  the two high points so far are    relatively lightweight   still comfortable after an hour i m worried about the folding mechanism  i m not certain just how many times i can fold these before something snaps off  at least all    the moving parts appear to be some kind of light to medium steel  instead of more plastic  i got these as very inexpensive  relatively acceptable headphones that wouldn t make me worry too much about theft or loss  i think they ll fill that niche  but that s as far as they go
