light weight   flimsy 
i love how light weight this is  however i haven t noticed that it s any more water repellant than any other umbrella that i ve ever used  where this really loses points  however  is that the very first time i used it  the wind blew the umbrella inside out and it immediately collapsed  not even gale force winds  just a quick  normal surge of wind  seems like we ve forfeited structural integrity in order to keep it light weight  but it s not worth it if the umbrella can t even make it 5 minutes 
not consistent with reviews or description 
i must have received a bad item or something because it s nothing like what the reviews or description made it out to be  two stars only for the functioning open and close button and it holds up fairly well against the wind  other than that  it s really wobbly  not water repellant at all  broke after about five uses  i am so disappointed in paying so much for an umbrella that pretty much doesn t live up to the description when i could have paid half for one that would last me longer  the ribs are starting to come undone from the string that attaches it to the umbrella  wonder how long before al the other ribs start doing the same  i would be really weary about purchasing 
not  super light  or lightweight  misleading product description 
i was looking for a lightweight umbrella to replace my stolen davek mini  this one looks sturdy  and certainly could last a few heavy rains  but is not lightweight at all and not compact compared to all the other umbrellas that i have purchased so far  the handle is heavy  and it is too big for my regular purse  well  since i live abroad and cannot return it  i would if i could    i will keep it as a replacement umbrella in my car  but i am upset by such a misleading description  will not buy again from this seller  edit  got a refund for this item 
not what i had hoped    
for all the money i paid for this umbrella  i m incredibly disappointed that after two uses  the inner metal is rusting  i left it open   not fully  since it would be in the way in my small home   but it took an eternity to dry out and when it finally had  i noticed the rust  i expected a much better quality at the cost i paid  also  the inside has plastic parts  i was purchasing this for it s  windproof  ability  i guess they meant a light breeze  in real weather  this isn t the go to  of course  i bought it in preparation of the bad weather  and am past my return period  oh well  live and learn 
eh   
first of all  this umbrella really does hold its own against strong winds  it won t turn inside out on you  unfortunately  mine has broken down for non wind reasons despite minimal use  i ve only used the umbrella a few times  and at least two different ribs have snapped where the last segment should connect  so instead of a nice uninterrupted dome shape  there are a few areas on the umbrella where a rib goes limp and the fabric sags unattractively   and sometimes spills rainwater unexpectedly  i don t know that i would recommend this item  i m pretty disappointed after investing in a  nice  umbrella for a change 
water leaked through the fabric 
i bought this umbrella because it was the highest rated umbrella on amazon  in a moderate rain storm the water actually leaked through the fabric material  i was shocked to look up and see water coming through part of the umbrella  the fabric seemed to be porous  there was no gaping hole or other defect  also  moderate wind was able to flip this umbrella  it did not destroy the umbrella but it did flip  not windproof  although it does seem more rigid than most umbrellas 
not worth the price
purchased this umbrella because it had great reviews and i was willing to spend a little more for quality  however  ive now had the opportunity to use it multiple times and im completely underwhelmed  umbrella constantly flips out in low wind  button on handle also closes the umbrella which has happened to me while walking in the rain and you have to completely compress the umbrella just to get it to open back up  save some money and get a cheaper umbrella  i would not purchase again 
shoddy joints  lasted less than a month 
two stars based on product longevity  i bought this on april 22nd  so i ve owned it for less than a month  probably opened closed it less than thirty times  and i didn t abuse it  closed it using the button  etc   the rivet which holds one of the arm joints together popped off  so i now have an umbrella with a floppy side when closed and an incomplete opening action  this is the kind of thing i d expect from a dollar store umbrella 
nice compact umbrella but   
i bought the umbrella about 10 months ago after reading the amazon reviews on how it was the best compact and a bargain at its offered sale price  on the good side  the umbrella is a decent size and weight for carrying around in a briefcase and it did not turn inside out in wind gusts  on the bad site  all of the ribs rusted after only a few uses  also it s not easy to bring the metal shaft back down to the compact position  while i understand the company is required to make shortcuts in quality to meet the high demand from customers while still maintaining profits  it is unfortunate that these cuts require my buying another umbrella so soon
