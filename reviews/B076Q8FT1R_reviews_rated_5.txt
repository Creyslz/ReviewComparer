great umbrella
i bought this umbrella because i have to walk a little bit to get to the bus stop every day and got caught in rain once  i m so happy i did because it rained like crazy 4 days of this week  it works great  has a button to open it and if you wanna close it you just click it again  it also has a pretty good looking case and it fits in the side pocket of my backpack  would recommend 
    came in today   i could not be more pleased  it came in a sleek leather carrying case    
my umbrella came in today   i could not be more pleased  it came in a sleek leather carrying case along with a sleeve for the umbrella itself  it was so simple to use  you just simply push the button to make it eject  umbrella itself is durable   huge  a great size for rainy days  could even share it with a friend   be comfortable  you really cant find great umbrellas like this for such a cheap price any more 
if you are looking for a nice  company umbrella
if you are looking for a nice  company umbrella  this is a perfect choice  this one exceeded my expectations  not only did it come with the standard cover that most umbrellas have  it also has an nice leather cover as well  this makes it nice to keep water from dropping on the floor when you come in from the rain  the umbrella also has a button to open and close it  this makes things handy when you have your hands full  overall  this is an excellent umbrella for the cost 
good quality
i love this automatic umbrella good quality provide plenty of coverage fairly good job very convenient to use easy to use when you have a toddler i highly recommend this 
small but mighty umbrella 
i am loving this little umbrella  it is really small which is great because it can fit in my purse or my son s backpack  we will never get stuck in a downpour again  it is very well made  it s strong to hold up against high winds  it opens easily with the push of a button  it s also very easy to close  i am really glad i decided to buy this one 
easy to carry around
very high quality umbrella  open and close with a touch of the button  comes with two cases  easy to carry around  very satisfied with the order 
very sleek and easy to use 
very sleek  love his classy looking umbrella  so easy to use  press a button on the extended handle to open and press a second time to fold up  i hate it when trying to get into a car in the pouring rain   one had out the card door while you are trying to fold the umbrella  this solves that  folds down so quickly and all you have to do is lock it not place  opens to a large  fully covered size  comes with an extra waterproof leather case  very excited that it comes with a life time guarantee  i have always had flimsy umbrellas and thrown them all out  this is a definite keeper 
good buy
bigger than i expected  look very classy and worth every penny  it sturdier than it look 
my bodygaurd travel umbrella is perfect   i have spent so much money on    
my bodygaurd travel umbrella is perfect   i have spent so much money on small cheap umbrellas for them jus to break after a couple uses so when i saw this one my expectations wasnt very high   but i was so wrong   the case that comes with it is very well made and thick so you dont have to worry about it ripping  the actual umbrella is made very steady  it has a button to make it open but also one to close it which i had never seen before   and with all of that it is still compact enough for me to put in my purse and carry   i love mine   
pretty impressed 
first let me say that this umbrella came so well packaged  it also came with a nice vinyl carrying case  that is not common  so its great to have because you can store a wet umbrella in your bag for emergency purposes  it also came with that sleeve that all umbrella s have  the ease of use of this umbrella was great  i was surprised  you know how you buy an umbrella and that button only services to open it up  well this one serves to close it as well   you still have to push it down into place but it works perfect if you are trying to get into your car and not get soaked to the bone   i honestly am very pleased that i purchased this and the only downside is that i couldn t have it in a hot pink or electric blue  other than that this umbrella is a great bang for your buck 
sturdy umbrella
i ordered this online because i didn t want to go to an actual brick and mortar store for one  it arrived on time in a medium size box in a leather like pouch and then a cover over the umbrella  one thing i noticed upon removing from the sleeves and opened it that the ends of the metal frame should have had some sort of plastic stoppers at the ends  upon hitting the switch to make it go up is a little hard to push open  bit to put it down its fast and forceful and makes a whooshing noise  scares me almost every time  it fits back in the sleeve upon closing it up  its nice and sturdy  i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great umbrella  my camera is on the fritz otherwise i would have added photos or video 
two thumbs up  solid construction   functionality 
i received the umbrella a few days ago  the first thing i noticed was the weight and construction  this is a substantial  well built umbrella  this is not your ordinary lightweight  flimsy travel umbrella  this umbrella is well constructed and feels like it will hold up to strong wind and heavy rain with no problem  the next thing i noticed was the size  its very compact as a travel umbrella should be until its opened  then it becomes a full size umbrella  no more keeping your head dry while the rest of your body gets wet  this thing will give you as much coverage as a large full size non travel umbrella  another positive point is the button spring mechanism  the springs are strong and the button works great  once you push the button  it instantly opens  this is very important if you are getting out of the car and into strong rain  another nice feature is the leather carrying case  although it came with the regular thin sleeve that fits very tightly  it also came with a nice leather carrying case with an opening large enough that it fits in easily  making storage much easier  the verdict   two thumbs up 
but it feels and looks like its true that it wont flip inside out on    
this is definitely high quality and i feel it will last  one thing that might bother some though is that its a little heavier than most umbrellas  i have yet to try it out on a windy day yet though  but it feels and looks like its true that it wont flip inside out on a windy day  which is why its a little heavier  im happy about my purchase
love it
i recently got a chance to test this out with a crazy rain storm that hit right when i got to the store  i had an 8 month old and a 3 yr old to try and get into the store dry  the automatic button to open was simply amazing since i only had one hand to do so        then to close it while holding a baby and a toddlers hand was also just simply luxurious to press the button again and it closes up perfectly  wow   i can do this again easily with two kiddos in the rain  the fabric also felt very strong and well made  this is a great umbrella for a busy mama     love love love      
perfect umbrella  wish i had bought sooner 
i can t believe i took so long to finally buy a decent umbrella  this one is definitely worth the money  it is quite large  and you can tell that it is well built and will last a long time  this umbrella comes with a soft cover as well as a very nice  heavier leather cover  i am so glad i gave in and bought this umbrella  i look forward to never having to buy another one  it is made that well 
surpassed my expectations
this is a high end umbrella and definitely surpassed my expectations  its a push button to open close which is extremely convenient when you have your hands full  its a pretty big size umbrella as you can see in the pic  large enough to accommodate several people  it has a leather pouch  with a loop which is great for hanging up  and also has the nylon case also to slip over when you want to keep it dry free from dripping  this is perfect for throwing in any diaper bag  the umbrella is made with teflon and i highly recommend 
very happy with this umbrella
we ve used this a few times already and love it  it opens easily and seems very sturdy  the exterior case is a faux leather and seems very classy  this is not a mini or compact so if you re looking for something super light and tiny  then this isn t it  it s not really long though either  like mary poppins would carry  i d looked for a long time for the perfect umbrella to replace the big golf one we had that broke  we keep this under a seat in the car and use it to cover a parent and one of our kids  this one fits the bill perfectly 
i always assumed they were all pretty much the same
all umbrella s are not created equal  seriously  i always assumed they were all pretty much the same  i generally buy them at the local retail store or flea market  and i ve noticed that they always seem to break fairly easily   one good gust of wind and the spokes are dangling  so this time  i figured  ok   let s spend a couple dollars more and see if there s a difference   and there is  i m in the northeast  and as i write this  we are experiencing a  nor easter  with a lot of rain and some pretty powerful wind gusts  i used this umbrella several times today and it held up like a champ  impressed me enough that i sat down to write a review tonight  if you re on the go a lot as i am  it s worth the investment 
makes a nice gift 
i bought this and thought it was broken at first because i couldnt get it to stay open  then i noticed that there is a button on the handle if you press it down the umbrella will stay open  whats even cooler is that it is spring loaded and if you press it a second time it colapes the umbrella  this is very sturdy  the edges dont just drop off  they curve down for extra protection from the rain  comes with both a cloth sleeve and a plether one as well  makes a nice gift 
the humvee of umbrellas   
i recently traveled to washington state and didn t have an umbrella with me   big mistake  my wife usually steals all the umbrellas so it was time i get one for me  this is high quality  what i really love is the button which opens and closes the umbrella automatically  i m a big guy so the least amount of flailing around i can do the better  when you open this umbrella  there s no wind gust that is going to mess this thing  fantastic product and terrific seller 
nice quality 
quality umbrella  this folds up smaller than those cheap umbrellas you can buy from say a street vendor or a pharmacy but when you open it it s much bigger and great quality  it s not cheap by any means  the price is great for such a good umbrella  and of course perfect for traveling  i like it for when my daughter when i m standing at her bus stop i can put it in my coat for her when she gets off the bus because it s so compact 
great small umbrella
umbrella is a little bit smaller than expected but perfect for one person  extremely light  going to use it for travel this summer  and the button push is effective for opening and closing  if you push the button without the velcro strap undone to allow it to open    the umbrella will probably launch out of your hands lol the normal cover is fine and the leather cover i have yet to use seems kind of excessive but it is nice 
jumping for joy 
i purchased this umbrella to have in the car as an extra  the past few days it s being raining here  and of course we forgot our huge umbrellas at home  i remembered i had stuck this one in the car and popped it out  i love it  it s close feature is what has me jumping for joy  it s so smooth and easy to handle with one hand  my 10 year old ended up stealing it  it s so easy for her to open and close  she would be afraid of umbrella s that it would pinch her  no more that with this smooth open and close feature on it 
high end umbrella
this sleek  black umbrella was a great addition to my travel bag  i travel a lot for work  the auto open close button allows you to one handedly open and close the umbrella for ease and convenience  it is sleek  easy to fit in any bag  it is sturdy  to eliminate flipping inside out  i also noticed that with oned shake of the hand  you can ride of excess water droplets  for quicker storage 
easy to use with one hand 
easy to use and with kids you have a lot of stuff to carry out the door and is nice to be able to use it with just one hand  it is a bit heavy but tolerable  one bit of advice is you do have to push the whole thing back into lock to be able to open it again with the button  which i did with just one hand by putting the tip on the ground and pushing down  nice cover for it too 
protection against fall  winter  spring  and summer
love this heavy duty  strong umbrella  i am tired of buying cheap  non sturdy umbrellas that fold inside out and break  i live in arizona where the sun is relentless so i need a wide  sun blocking umbrella to protect me from the brutal sun  it is large  wide enough for coverage of more than one person and strong enough to block any storm  it s a very good  worthy umbrella 
awesome umbrella
this is an awesome umbrella  it has the button to unfold and retract which makes it to where you dont have to wrestle with it to close it in the rain while getting in your car  it is teflon coated so the rain just rolls right off  it also has a heavy duty holder so you can slip it back in when you dont need it and not have to worry about getting water everywhere  i would recommend to all my friends and family
strong and durable without being cumbersome or heavy
i received this umbrella just in time  our area had tornadic activity and strong wind gusts and this umbrella worked like a champ  easy open and closure and strong in the wind without being heavy or cumbersome  the center poll and branches are definitely made stranger than standard umbrellas  the folding mechanism is uniquely durable to withstand wind and the fabric is also sturdy  the umbrella also comes with 2 nicee slip on case covers and when folded up is light and compact   easy to slip into a carry all bag or even has a hand strap to carry alone  i am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to others
goodbye pinched fingers
gotta say i really enjoy this new umbrella  its nicely made and appears well built  its full size  not one of them cheap mini ones  and has a single button push to operate  its on the handle  push it once  it pops open like you would expect  push it again  the umbrella retracts closed  no reaching up and under to try to close  no more getting ur finger pinched either  you do need to push the telescoping ride back down but its easy  came with a nice carrying case to help protect it being stashed in the car  all in all great umbrella  would easy say worth the  20
i absolutely love this umbrella
i absolutely love this umbrella  it s strong  easy to use  compact  and looks nice it provides plenty of coverage  this is a travel umbrella the opening mechanism works very well and the umbrella pops open  the ribs are thicker and appear to be better constructed than my previous umbrella  this earns a five star rating for me 
quality umbrella  i may order my second one soon 
love this umbrella  bodyguard travel umbrella it was built with 10 ribs  its the finest windproof umbrella with teflon coating  it does auto open and close  it dose have a comfort handle  it also came with leather sleeve  i would recommend this high quality umbrella to anyone  im glad i ordered   you will be happy if you did 
i was waiting on some bad weather so that i could use it before i    
i had my umbrella for a few days now  i was waiting on some bad weather so that i could use it before i do my review  it was very easy to open and close  unlike other umbrellas that i have had this one held up very well when the wind was blowing hard  if you are looking for a good umbrella then i would recommend this one 
very nice and well made umbrella
this is an awesome umbrella very sturdy and well built  but the biggest thing i like is the push button to open and close  ive never had one that does both  its a big umbrella reminds me a gold size umbrella  it comes with a cover and a leather like case very elegant 
very nice umbrella
i got to use the umbrella yesterday  i was pleasantly surprised by how nice this umbrella is  its a nice size and easy to use  i shook it out and when i went to put it in the car it was totally dry  i was shocked   i have always hated using umbrellas because of how wet they are when putting them away or in your vehicle  i would recommend this umbrella to anyone and i would purchase it again 
easily opens closes with a quick push button  sturdy umbrella 
this umbrella is packed very nicely  comes in a leather carrying case with a strap  it handled the wind   rain as expected with full body coverage  it has an automatic open close push button that is very convenient for one handed handling  makes a very nice gift for men or women  highly recommended  very satisfied with this product 
i love this umbrella
i love this umbrella  the length of the handle is perfect  the compact size stores neatly and the leather pouch is nice to keep it from getting opened on accident in my bag  the easy open and close makes my life so much easier as i most always have my hands full and this allows me to multi task  would definitely buy again 
i really was glad i bought it
i bought his for the summer sun  over this week we had some huge storms move in our area so i started using the umbrella early  i really was glad i bought it  i love the easy open and the easy retractable it offers  very well made and has a nice looking case to store it in  if i need another one this will be the one i purchase 
impressive  nicer than expected 
i am so impressed with this umbrella  it is way nicer than expected and pictured  it is bigger than i imagined for a foldable and travel  but because of the size and construction  its so big and sturdy  love it  i bought it for the leather case to keep my car and bag dry  but it also has a nylon sleeve if you prefer 
sturdy and great looking umbrella
great looking umbrella  love the outer cover for it  i havent got to use it for it hasnt rained since i got it  but looking forward to using it to show off to my friends   the umbrella is of nice quality and the outer case is really a nice added bonus   i dont think you would be disappointed in buying this great umbrella

best umbrella i ve had

it s handy and it fits in any purse 
it s a must have for me  as mom i m always on the go  and when rainy days come this sturdy umbrella is a big help  it s easy to open but when closes it you just need to exert a little energy to push it  you can feel that this will last long just use it with care

pros   bigger than most umbrellas  sturdy cons   heavy  this isn t a con for me though because it s a quality build  it is heavier than it seems to state in the description  but it s still the best umbrella i ve yet to own 
umbrella perfection  
the perfect umbrella  super quick shipping  i really like the weight of it  not too heavy but it doesnt feel too light and flimsy  i love the knob that you pull down to close the umbrella  it fits perfectly in your hand and closes easily  the material is of good quality  it is nice that not only does it come in a case made of the same material as the umbrella but also a leather case  i would purchase again and i will recommend to friends and family

awesome 
umbrella is easy to use  got it for my 9yr old son because when it rains the old umbrella was hard for him close but nownhe can hit the button and open and hit the button again to close automatically  so much easier for a kiddo to handle  and it also comes with a great case 
small but mighty

umbrella is very easy to use and is sturdy
umbrella is very easy to use and is sturdy  just click the button and the umbrella fully opens  cluck the button again and the umbrella closes  you still have to push the pole down  only issue i saw is that when you click the button to close you must push the pole down all the way in order to open the umbrella again

solid umbrella  retractable too 
seriously impressive  i ve never bothered to own an even remotely nice or quality umbrella  this thing feels super solid in the hand and when it s folded out you can tell it won t bend easily  i love the ability to retract it down  that is really awesome  almost left it at a hotel once and was super upset  great umbrella  buy it 
waiting to really test it 
looks and feels like a quality umbrella  i will have to update my review after some downtown commuting in the spring  so far  its definitely a step up from the last umbrella i had  that snapped in half from wind

exellent umbrella
this is the best umbrella i have ever had seriously  it s heavy duty and opens and closes bye itself  i used it today while it was snowing and i had to go out  was great there was nothing i don t like about it

perfect umbrella 
this umbrella is absolutely amazing  it is easy to open  easy to close and the leather case is a perfect complement  my husband likes it so much he wants me to order another  i am beyond impressed 
automated   big 
its been rainy in nola   my siblings and i go out together often   this umbrella being automated and big has helped keep us all dry and without a hassle or struggling to open close the umbrella 
nice and sturdy
this is great  what i really like in umbrellas is that they can be big enough to fit at least two people  this umbrella does that  also it comes in a nice leather case  but it isnt too bulky to carry around 
this umbrella is weighty and feels very substantial  i    
this umbrella is weighty and feels very substantial  i have only used it once  but it was fairly windy and it did not bat an eye  i have not been in heavy wind yet  but have the notion that it will not falter  i do wish it was a little larger  but it is more than adequate for 1 person 
good things come in small packages like this 
it s hard to believe that there is an umbrella the size of this one in such a small size  it s definitely big enough for 2 people or one person and a set of golf clubs  i love how easy it is to open and close 
i love my new umbrella
i love my new umbrella  i broke three new umbrellas before i found this one  it feels like 007  s gadget  what i love about this is when you close it  water just bounces off and it s all dry  woohoo
light weight and easy to store and still when fully extended gives the    
durable light weight and easy to store and still when fully extended gives the canopy gives you plenty of coverage   automatically open close is great when you have your hands full    convenient travel umbrella for a reasonable price  
sturdy and convenient 
this item comes is a nice leather case with a loop for carrying  coincidentally it arrived today and it is sleeting so it was a perfect day to try it out  the wind was strong but the umbrella did great and the water shook off of it easily  the easy open and close allowed me to get in and out of the car completely dry  as a travel umbrella  it was slightly larger than i expected but it s worth it for the coverage it provides
