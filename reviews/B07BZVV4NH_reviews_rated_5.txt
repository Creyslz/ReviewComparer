dell computer
love my new dell  first dell i have owned  it set up very easy  had to get used to windows 10 but that is coming along too  very quiet  can t even hear it run  i love it because it is so small   have lots of room on my desk  it is half the size of my old one  love it 
i m working on it now  darn it 
dose just what i need and more  the darn thing keeps pace  meaning i get no break  all kidding aside this is a very good computer
