decent blender  horribly over packaged
the blender is decent  good stuff  easy cleanup  two mixing cup sizes with nice sealed lids  it grinds fruits and veggies into a nice smooth drinkable blend  bad  the capacity of the larger mixing vessel is less than idea  at most you can make a single largeish smoothie  i d prefer to be able to make two biggins at a time  it s excessively loud  so much so that my noisy little coffee grinder shudders in fear when the ninja begins to scream  the packaging material used to protect and ship this item was over the top  see the picture  it was in a corrugate box inside a double corrugate box inside still another corrugate box  plus three molded cardboard inserts and no less that seven assorted plastic bags and such  no wonder amazon ceo jeff bezos is obsessed with space exploration  at this rate amazon will deplete the planet s packaging resources in no time  let s try to do better  meanwhile i m going back to local shopping for things like this that distributed with reasonable consideration for our precious planet  cheers 
serves the purpose but loud as heck 
so this is the second time i am buying this after the first one stopped blending well and became super loud after a couple of years  i owned the nitri blender professional but hated it because it makes watery smoothies that aren t smooth at all  really didn t want to purchase another nutrininja but after reading reviews about other extractors this one seems like the best bet for what i need  it does blend smooth and quick  however it is loud as heck and vibrates like it s not calibrated properly  i almost wonder if this is a defect and need to be returned because i don t think it should vibrate the way it does  almost as if it isn t stable  i will update after a bit of usage  other than my previous concerns this blender is ok  comes packaged well  the cups although i wish were larger are good quality  and the recipe booklet is informative about nutrition and smoothie recipes 
a big disappointed 
it does the work it s supposed to do  by that i mean it mixes everything up in a very quick manner  my only and big problem with this is that it does t have a lock option so it is really manual   i have to stand there with my hand on top to get it going and keep it going   a similar product i used had the capability to lock the container in and keep on mixing until i turned it off  you probably did this for safety s sake  but it s nt a great idea for me  otherwise  it s fine  but that was a big big disappointment to me and had i known i would have looked for exactly what i wanted  in other words  i am not explaining this well   it doesn t have a lock option 
it works wonderfully  have yet to encounter an item it cannot    
pros  when it works  it works wonderfully  have yet to encounter an item it cannot blend  makes fine work of both soft ingredients  fruit  vegetable leaves  etc   as well as harder ingredients  carrots  almonds  etc   cons  can be difficult to secure the lid with a full bottle  can be difficult to clean  especially inside the unit  not for those looking for  quiet  blenders  final  as far as single serve smoothie makers go  this does the job just fine 
dont buy if you already have a blender 
i still get fruit stuck on the blades and pieces of pulp or fiber  cranberries and pineaple is what i consume more  its just like a regular blender  nothing special i does not do what you see on the tv ad  no it wont  disolve  fruit nor seeds nor nuts    i still find it practical as a travel blender  i am a contractor so im away from home all the time  but definitely not what you see on tv 
not that much better than the less expensive bullet
i replaced a failing bullet believing i was getting a far greater unit in both performance and durability  from the first use this unit leaks and didn t perform significantly better than the less expensive bullet  i will keep it but was not as happy with the results as i was hoping for  additionally  as others have pointed out the base of this unit is very hard to remove when hot liquids are being blended  my wife uses this for bullet coffee every day  she is very strong and still needs me to open this up for her occasionally  since it is so hard to remove the fact that it still leaks is a mystery   
loud  but does the trick 
super loud  but does the trick  i m embarrassed to make shakes in the morning for fear that i ll wake up my neighbors in my apartment building  i m not exaggerating  it s loud   but i really enjoy the single serve aspect of this blender and how fast it blends my smoothies  read many reviews about not over filling to avoid leaking  and i haven t had problems since i m conscious of not over filling  oh yeah  did i mention it s super loud  you ve been warned 
like  chainsaw in your kitchen loud
i was excited to receive this because my magic bullet finally perished after a long and satisfying career  unfortunately i m not as impressed as i d hoped to be  to start  this blender is loud  like  chainsaw in your kitchen loud  but ok  i thought i d be so impressed with it s blending ability i could look past that  not so     it doesn t completely pulverize all ingredients as promised  no matter how long you run the chainsaw    er blender   it leaves bits and pieces behind for a gritty smoothie  bummer 
too much trouble
i am trying to like this ninja  i used my daughter s last year and i thought all of the different ones of the same brand would work as well as the one she had  mine are used several times every day  i have used up 5 magic bullets in the last 10 years  my 5th one has just about had it  so i started looking at the nutri ninja blenders  these are my biggest complaints with the model i purchased  there is only one blade  i think it is a crushing blade but i am not sure what they called it  mine is having lots of problems crushing up frozen fruit  it is very loud and i have to keep adding liquid and taking it off  opening the lid and stirring yet  i always have pieces of fruit from the bottom that is not blended  next  even though it came with two cups  they are much larger than i can drink at a time  i saw where someone said that you must be careful  not to overfill it  the fill line is marked clearly on the cup  the cups are smooth and do not have a handle to carry it with  that is a big problem for me  i have ms and i do not always have full use of my hands  i have dropped the cup full of liquid two times so far  i have started using the ninja pro to use as a juicer and then i have to pour it into one of my magic bullet cups that have a handle  you get 2 lids  just alike  with a spout and a lid to keep it from spilling  i don t know about having it in the car because the cups are too big for my console cup holders  i am very disappointed with this purchase and i am considering sending it back and going back to my magic bullet which has two kinds of blades  4 handled cups as well as a tall one and short one that doesn t have handles  i also get a large pitcher for larger crowds  the nutri ninja has more power but is it worth the price 
i love it but i don t think its that powerful for    
i love it but i don t think its that powerful for a ninja and the price i go by the rules and directions and constantly have to open it and move things around and i ve never had this problem with other machines  it still does the job though  and its extremely loud but you won t find any that aren t  although i wish you could
