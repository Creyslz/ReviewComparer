if you have the room  this shelf is worth the money
i live in an apartment  so i can t be drilling holes for floating shelves  nor is there much room for the bulkier  solid wood cabinet shelf  so this fits the bill perfectly  function wise  i got the dark espresso version  which is the color of dark chocolate but with more brown  if that makes sense  looks rather modern  by no means in a traditional looking room will this blend in  what with the plastic pipes  any who  likes    each shelf  wood plank  holds according to the manual  89 lbs  which is more than enough for my needs   no tools are needed    there are only a few steps to assemble each floor of the shelf  then you repeat   little wobbly but rigid nonetheless dislikes    the end caps for the topmost pipes were slightly squished  two of four   so i had to use pliers to squeeze them back into shape  this isn t enough to warrant a star deduction though   doesn t make me breakfast took about 15 minutes to assemble  possibly less if you forgo reading the instructions  if you ve built one of these already  you can assemble this shelf in 10 or less minutes   you can also disassemble  i presume  the shelf if you need to move  you just reverse the order of the way you put it together  i actually do have enough room for another one so if i so desire  i shall buy another  great shelf for the money   unless your end caps are squished from shipping  then some pliers can help shape them back
the shelves are about as good as you d expect them to be
the shelves are about as good as you d expect them to be  the product definitely doesn t ship perfect  there are some nicks here and there and a lots of saw dust left behind  no big deal  the assembly is very straight forward and simple but the tubes are pretty tough to spin and tighten 
a good interim solution
i bought two of these  one for either side of the tv  for my new apartment when i ran out of money to buy better bookcases  these are great for what they are  plastic items that you just screw together  to clarify  the side pieces literally fit into the shelves and you tighten them in  you do not need metal screws or a screwdriver  i would not use them for anything very heavy  but i had two boxes of books that i really wanted to get onto shelves  and by putting the heaviest ones on the bottom and progressively lighter items on the higher shelves  i think it worked out well  these would be good for dorm rooms  for closet storage  possibly for garages or laundry rooms  if you just needed an inexpensive way to store light items  when i save the money for nice  wooden bookcases or storage units  i will use these for closet storage in my walk in bedroom closet  or perhaps just donate them to a charitable organization  recommended  as long as you realize what you are getting  and what the limitations are 
exactly what i needed  looks pretty 
this is a very cheap bookshelf  so you can t expect awesome quality  that settled  i really like this product  it s super easy to build  doesn t need any tools   just your hands and 15 minutes  the planks are made of wood composite  but look good enough  i chose the beech white color  and it looks pretty against the wall  mine doesn t wobble  as other reviews have said  maybe it s because i placed it in a corner so it s supported by two walls  overall  it doesn t look as cheap as it is  and although it s obvious the shelves won t stand a ton of weight  they look sturdy enough for a couple of books and other stuff that isn t very heavy  this is not a shelf for books only  because it won t stand the weight  but you can definitely store some books and then something else  please check the dimensions  as this is smaller in width than your usual bookshelf  again  it s not a bookshelf  
cheap  easy to assemble and very convenient 
basically you re getting 4 wood shelves and some plastic tubes that twist lock into one another  assembly takes less than 10 minutes and even a caveman can do it  the black grey version does look significantly cheaper than the beech white  you can safely store and stack whatever you want   books  movies  figurines  etc  its pretty strong  i m not advocating using this to store a safe or your bowling ball collection because the wooden shelves aren t thick enough for that kind of weight  i have a blu ray player  wii  wii u  xbox 360  and playstation 2 on this rack and they all fit perfectly  i can fit 2 consoles on 1 shelf  with breathing room so they re not right on top of each other  i purchased this and the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish and i must say the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish is by far the better deal for just like  2 more  it s more visually impressive on display and doesn t look as cheap as this black grey version  also its more stable  if i touch the black grey shelf  it rocks side to side a few times  the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish just seems much more stable  at the bottom of the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish you get an extra piece of wood that forms a divider on the bottom shelf where you can slide the bins into  and i think perhaps that is what provides better strength and stability to that shelf overall 
great shelf for the price 
looks just as advertised  came in a very compact box  the bars screw into each other  not the shelves  so it is super easy to put together  and looks like it won t be a problem to take apart for easy moving as well  ours had minor damage on one of the shelves  the corner looked like it had been scratched  and the finishing came off  talked to an amazon rep  and they were able to take care of it though  it s a little unstable on carpet  but with a little bit of weight on the bottom shelf  it looks like it won t tip over  the shelf came with a cable tie and screw to attach to a wall  but we didn t have a drill bit  the only other thing is each shelf is recommended not to hold more than 15 pounds  so look elsewhere if you re looking for a heavy weight shelf 
easy to assemble   affordable
it was incredibly easy to assemble  took me 1 minute to read the guide and 5 minutes to put everything together  this comes from someone who almost never assembles any furniture   i got this shelf for my kitchen because i finally got tired of looking at all my pots and pans on the stove  it doesn t come with any oder  which is a big relief since i m quite sensitive to paint smells   and holds my pots and pans very well  however  it is indeed held together with plastic tubes  so be aware and don t put heavy stuff on each shelf  especially top ones    leave your microwave on the kitchen counter  i can tolerate the wobbly here and there since it s so cheap  and as long as i don t run into it  i don t think any will fall apart  all in all  it s a good kitchen addition 
good stand
i have had this before and the saying goes   you get what you pay for   well with this nifty little space saving shelf you actually get a little more  i have a 19 inch flat screen on top  a playstation  wii  saga  bluetooth speaker  router  sub woofer speaker and a shelf full of games all on the entire unit  i do not anchor it to the wall  and i do not move it around  i dust and sweep under that s about it  it will last  i only threw out my old one because i wanted a larger unit 
worked great for my needs 
as others noted the shelves are easy to assemble  easy to tip over and easily scratched  i put them between end of my computer desk   the wall  so stability isn t an issue for me  you can use two or more of the shelf riser assemblies  three was almost exactly desktop height  but i used all four  easily holds my computer tower on top  with power strip  joysticks  etc on the lower shelves 
great quality shelf for a good price
i bought this as a shelf for my for my dining room to display books and small picture frames and other little figurines that i have had sitting packed away  i used the bottom shelf for some heavy hardcover books  the second to bottom shelf i used for books and i used my owl bookends to keep them from toppling over  i put smaller paperback books on the second shelf  also with small bookends on the side  on the top i put a few small picture frames and some other small treasures that i have wanted to display  a small framed collage my son made  a couple of glass figures  a tiny eiffel tower from my trip to france years ago      i like that this came with a small cord so this can be fastened to the wall  granted  it is not going to stop the shelf from falling if someone rips it roughly  but when my ten pound cat decided to try jumping on the shelf  it didn t come toppling down  this was so easy to put together  i just screwed on the plastic bars onto the pressed board shelves  i think this looks very nice in my dining room  it is not an expensive piece of furniture  but i really like how the black and silver  yes plastic bars  but they are silver colored  stands out  i would buy another one of these  and i may in the future 
air it out first  then it s great 
great  used it in my closet to organize shoes and purses  super easy to put together and looks just like the pictures  only complaint is that when it arrives  it has a very strong smell  i think it is just from the chemicals that are used to coat the  wood   but if i had to do it over again  i would build it  then sit it outside to air out for 2 3 days before bringing it inside 
furrinno 4 tier shelf unit
arrived in good shape   just one very small nic on one of the corners of one shelf   really super easy to put together takes about 5 minutes  it s really lightweight   no horrible smells just as described   got it for the workshop and it fits two of the 12x8x10 canvas bins on each shelf for organizing   i like the fact it is so light weight making it very easy to move around and that is why i went with this rather than solid wood product  
easy setup
it s easy to setup and the shelf looks relatively nice  i do have to say that the top and bottom tiers are the weakest since  it doesn t have the top and bottom support bars  so if you put more than 15 lbs on the top and bottom tiers the wood bends slightly  but i haven t had any issues with it and it seems to be able to handle a decent amount of things 
cheap   functional  perfect for a college dorm room apartment 
i was looking for a cheap and durable shelf to hold my keurig k200 in my room  this was not what i was looking for  at least on carpet  it s wobbly and does not seem like it would hold the weight  i wasn t disappointed really though because for the price it really doesn t make too much of an impact on my wallet  it s size and portability make it really appealing for me  with some minor adjustments  i was able to make it fit into my living space  setup couldn t have been more straightforward  it took me 10 minutes to unpack the shelf and assemble it  to me  it s a welcomed addition that adds some more storage options for me which is a definite plus  although it did not meet what i had originally set out for before  i can still find a place for it somewhere which is great 
small and cute
small and cute i really like this shelf  we live in a small apartment its perfect in width for my needs  it was easy to put together which i appreciate  the only things i didnt like is that it had a few scuff marks and a tiny chip at the top  i ordered two  i wanted a little more height for one and used two tiers from one for the other  i made a mini shelf with what was left 
functional shelving unit for light loads
i was looking for easy to assemble shelves for my dorm room that could be easily dismantled for storage at the end of the year  this unit works perfectly  it took probably five minutes to assemble  this isn t quality furniture by any means   all the components are cheap  composite board and plastic tubing  and look almost disposable  but i don t think anyone would expect more for the price and description  there was some damage out of the package  which doesn t really bother me  it also does wobble a little and i wouldn t put too much weight on it  but i m overall happy with it 
money well spent
i just received this   had it assembled in a matter of minutes  the height is good next to my desk for my printer  internet boxes   some other misc  stuff  this would be a great piece in any small space to put misc  stuff on  over time heavy items would damage it  but  it s obviously not made to be a  life time  piece of furniture  though i think it could last a very long time 
great product at a great price
good inexpensive shelves that go together easily  hold all my books without a problem  i did stack to the back of teh shelf as they will tip over easily on carpet but over all these are great inexpensive shelving for starter or temporary houseing  they are not designed to move once you put them in place  you can move them but you want to be careful moving them without disassembly 
easy to assemble  they say it takes around 15 mins
easy to assemble  they say it takes around 15 mins  most of that is unpacking and opening the bags with the tubes   make sure to follow the weight limits  also  for stability  if you re putting anything heavy on it  put it on the bottom shelf  any shelving units should always go heaviest on bottom lightest at the top   overall  though  its stable  my cat likes the middle shelf and it s not on the steadies of surfaces  but it hasn t tipped 
these look like they might be tall but there are not
these look like they might be tall but there are not  worked well for what i needed them for  which was to hold misc stuff for my home office
easy to assemble  good for lightweight storage
bought this to use as extra food storage space in the kitchen  it works well for my purpose  and it looks nice especially for the price  very easy to assemble  no tools you just screw everything together  takes about 10 mins  i will say  however  that it is not the most durable nor meant for heavy weight  even in the directions it advises you not to load it up with more than 15lb per shelf  great affordable option for lightweight storage 
good 
perfect for what i needed it for in a small space  looks nice  easy to put together  i m just bumming i can t buy replacement legs  i took it apart for a move and the legs are mia somewhere across the country     movers lost them  oh well  great product  if they ever sell replacement legs  i d get them  so i ll hold onto the panels for a bit 
for the money  can t beat it 
being deployed to afghanistan leaves little to no options for furnishing your hooch  at my last location we built shelves and desks from scarp wood  at the location that i ordered these shelves for  i was in a tent  i had little to no room  instead of taking up the marines time making me shelves and a desk i ordered both items  here at amazon  from furinno  i figure when i rip out i will just leave them here for the next guy  these shelves work great for my needs and i can see them being good in a dorm situation  setup was a cinch  no tools needed  just screw the pieces together and you re done  a coupe of corners had some marking  like something hit it hard or had too much pressure applied  this did not impact the ability to assemble the product nor will it impact it s ability to hold something  i don t blame the packing or the company as i know how mail gets treated once it hits the military mail side  all in all i am very happy with these shelves as they are compact yet serve the purpose i need while deployed 
great for the price 
i got this shelf to go in a closet for paper towels  toilet paper and cleaning supplies  i put it together in 5 minutes or less  super easy  it is light weight but seems sturdy  the shelves are just the right size to lay paper towel rolls down  i would purchase this again  even to use out in the open  the only reason i did not give 5 stars is one of the shelves had worn marks scratches on the finish  but  since it is in a closet i don t really care 
great look price functionality  but hard to assemble    manufacturing consistency problem 
looks great  price is great  the only downside is it was extremely hard for me to screw the tubes together  to the extent that i thought that i had a faulty product because it was so hard i thought the threading didn t line up  i searched reviews to see if others had similar problems  but apparently most thought it was hardest to screw in the top caps  which i thought screwed in extremely easily   i m wondering if their manufacturing machine is just inconsistent or there s a bad machine on the ground  perhaps all of my normal tubes went through that machine while others  top caps came out faulty  glad it s finally put together 
we like it so far
we like it so far  bought it for our bedrooom to put a flat screen tv on  its light cherry but matches our medium colored oak furniture  hope it holds up  our flat screen is pretty big
