get the jvc gumy headphones instead 
  tl dr below     updated review below   i just have to say wow  i had to spread the word on these guys  i am super impressed with these earbuds  if you told me that i could have a pair of earbuds that sounded great  did not distort any sound  were comfortable  looked decent  and they were only 8 dollars  i would slap you and call you a liar   i would be severely mistaken however  and arrested   as i am dead wrong  i had read reviews on a couple of different websites that these were the el dorado of earbuds under 50 dollars  some were so brave as to exclaim that these were the best earbuds under 100 dollars  i then found 33 000 reviews on amazon with the overwhelming majority saying that these are the best cheap earbud to get  these brash claims caught my attention  and as a gadget guru and headphone enthusiast  i had no choice but to succumb to the lavish price of 8 dollars  for those interested in a breakdown  these come with three sets of eartips  which i had to play with because i could not find the right size at first  making sure you have the right size ear tips in is crucial  because it will form a seal around your ear and you will be able to isolate and block external noise better  hear the music louder and clearer  and the bass will be more prominent  i have had these for a week so far and have used them for a multitude of things  ive watched movies  listened to music while mowing the lawn  these were sufficient at for drowning out most noise   worked out with them  and used them for playing games  the best things i would recommend them for are for just casually listening to music and watching movies  this is my general test on how good headphones are  play rage against the machine and see if i can get pumped up on the bass  then play i saw her standing there by the beatles and see if i can hear george harrison twanging away on his guitar over paul mccartneys overpowering bass  these definitely beat a lot of over the ear headphones that i own  the sound is balanced and i could hear everything almost exactly like the original audio recording  they also had a reasonable audio level and got as loud as i needed them before i hit the highest setting  i would not recommend these for working out  as they just kept falling out of my ears and distracting me while i was running i also would say that these are not an acceptable headphone for fps or multiplayer gaming  as you really need an over the ear set to amp up all the noise in the game and help give you directional listening  i could not pinpoint footsteps   etc  with these earbuds as well as with my audio technica and polk headsets  also  you need a decent mic for voice chat and this model does not have a mic  generally though  these are worth it for everything else mentioned  so  here i am  telling you to get these  get them now  dont hesitate    tl dr  8 dollar headphones  why you not buy      product update 08 14 16   5 stars dropped to 3 what am i doing up at 1247am on a sunday  one may answer that i am at a club having a great time  or watching a movie with my fiance  or having a sleepover with my family  but the answer to that question is none of the above  i am awake at this hour as your sworn headphone avenger  to tell you not to buy these headphones  you should buy these headphones instead  jvc hafx5b gumy plus inner ear headphones  black why  because i was a bit over zealous on my initial review  at the time of writing the original review  i had not found a suitable alternative for a cheap and reasonably decent sounding pair of headphones  but   just like all politicians  at some point when you make a public statement you have to back track when you re mouth was moving faster than your brain  i bought the jvc gumy headphones from best buy a few weeks ago and i was intending to test them side by side with the panasonic ergofits  i noticed some immediate improvements that the jvcs had over the panasonics  one was that the gummy seals for your ear are a lot more comfortable  secure  and provide a much better seal than the panasonics did  the next improvement was the mic and control button which the upgraded ergofit has  but you shouldn t go without it   the most important feature that the jvcs have over the panasonic is its performance  when i listened to one more time by daft punk on both headphones  the panasonics were very level all around and there was nothing spectacular that stood out  when i used the jvcs  my ears exploded with delight from the much better bass response it had  i have been using the jvcs for everything since then and i haven t looked back 
gone through 2 pairs in 3 months   in middle schooler vs earbud   middle schooler wins    
i keep reading how these have held up well and are good for  kids    but we ve gone through three pairs   two in the past 3 months alone  so they clearly do not hold up for us  my daughter uses these in school for spanish labs  and mostly at home to listen to music and video  at home they are left  around  and in school they are placed within her padded chromebook case  so not the most abused ear buds  i m getting a little tired of ordering new ones  so despite the advice in other reviews to  buy in bulk    i may just buy another brand and see if they last longer 
great while they last  2 pairs broke
i have purchased 3 pairs of these headphones   the first without a microphone and then two more with a microphone  the non microphone pair was really great   i used it for years before it finally gave out  the microphone version seemed just as great and i loved being able to use them to make calls  pause and start my music  etc  however  after about a year the plastic piece covering the speaker loosened and detached  i bought another pair and it only lasted a few months before the exact same thing happened  i think they must be using less glue or something because the microphone ones are much less sturdy  even though my second pair was still under warranty  i only bought it 2 5 months ago  panasonic refused to replace them because they were  damaged   panasonic   the damage is because of your faulty design 
these are okay 
panasonic ergofit in ear earbuds headphones with mic controller rp tcm125 k  black  i am a college student  so i rely on headphones when i am walking to class or walking around the town  i also love to use headphones while talking on the phone  so that i don t have to hold my phone up to my ear while i am walking  i am a little disappointed in these headphones mostly because every person i talked to on the phone would hear me echo  this pretty much means that they heard me say the same thing twice  which confused and distracted the people i was talking to  this was very inconvenient and disappointing to me  as headphones to listen to music youtube podcasts  it works as intended  no hearing difficulties and the headphones had crisp sound  good design as well  overall  these were just fine to use  but i hated talking to people on the phone with it  so if you are using these headphones strictly for listening purposes they work great 
it s okay  and for someone who keeps breaking much nicer headphones okay is fine 
in the last year i ve broken both audio technica and sennheiser ear buds  i take good care of the big headphones at home  but when i m on the go i tend to destroy them in no time  so  thanks to the rate at which i destroy the things  i decided to stop buying nice earbuds and get ones that won t matter if i destroy them in a month or two  they probably won t last long  the cords are really thin and plasticky rather than the thick braided cable that come with the better units i ve still managed to break  of course i can just grab another pair of these when they break and not be sad that i just destroyed an expensive pair of sennheiser earbuds again  the worst thing about these are the really poor earpiece selection  none of them properly fit my ears leaving me with a high tinny sound and almost zero bass unless i m wearing a hat that can press the buds into my ears  i ve read in reviews here that this is due to poor fit  but when none of the ear pieces actually fit me i can t test that out for myself  it s okay  and for the price it s not bad at all  i just need to set the eq on my player to be very bass heavy and turn the volume up higher than i normally would have it  i ll keep my quality at home where i have nice cans that are safe from being destroyed and take these with me so i can still listen to my music but not worry about taking care of my headphones 
thought these would be a good replacement for apple earbuds
while there seems to be a bit of a larger range soundwise when it comes to music  these actually feel pretty cheap  the cord is thin and does not feel like it will hold up the abuse my apple earbuds have taken   i even washed my apple ones a time or two when they got left in my pants pocket and they are as good as new  and clean   also  these panasonics have no volume control which i thought would be ok but i find it inconvenient to pull out my phone to adjust the volume  especially when i am sitting at work   the microphone seems to work well and the play pause button is convenient however i fear these will become my emergency back up headphones 
definitely consider these
i ve purchased many pair of these  pros  excellent sound quality for the money  i don t use a lot of bass   stay in my ears  many most buds fall out  i have very small ear openings  inexpensive  not a big deal if lost or damaged  cons  and this is the reason for only 3 stars  the microphone is too sensitive  when i ve used these with the phone and there is almost any ambient noise  the person on the other end of the line picks up every sound and i get frequent complaints that they cannot understand me due to the loud background noise  they find it very irritating  doesn t have volume control   but what do you expect for around  10 12 
good but not great 
i just bought these to replace a set of skull candy ear buds that got wrecked at the gym  these come with 3 sizes of foam ear piece inserts which i found make a huge difference  the mid size come installed on the buds  took these out of the package and headed to the gym w o listening first  i hated them  sounded tinny  no bass and i could hear everything around me which i had not experienced w  the skulls  tried the other inserts and huge difference  counter intuitively  thought the smaller inserts would allow the buds to go deeper into my ear canal and give me a better sound  wrong  the larger  block out  external noise and  trap  for lack of a better term  the sound in your ear giving more mid base  these are not great but i don t hate them the way i did at first  still not sure they are an improvement over the skulls but are close if not equal 
not bad
i go to the gym  cycle  run  etc   about 5 6 days a week  so i go through headphones fairly often  or they end up lost or damaged  i am a little spoiled as the tj maxx near me sells skully candy head phones for 7 99 that i have been very happy with  but it s located in a very traffic heavy part of town i have not gotten too recently  nor do i want to around the holidays   so these were close in price and a name brand  so i figured i would give them a shot  i first put them in an they sounded kind of trebley and tinny  and i instantly new what the issue was  another review hit it right on the head in a longer explanation   the biggest size of ear buds these come with don t seal my ear canal  with the sizes shipped  i could hear way to much of what was going on around me at the gym and not enough bass  that seal you get when when you put them in the ear is when you get more full sound  i swapped just the buds with another set and they actually are not at all bad  they have a little odd disc shape thing that sits in your ear to help keep them in  and the work well for my ears  anyway  the weren t going anywhere   which ended up being a good thing since the buds were too small then again  with buds that fit properly  i do not usually have a problem with them falling out anyway  the only other thing i didn t like is they have the connector at a right angle  and it s quite bulky and square shaped  it just barely fits into the area allowed for by my iphone case  so if you have a larger more protective case  as many active people using iphones might  this could be an issue for you  and i think they actually would be a pain for the arm band case i use for running outdoors   i guess if i had been paying 15 20 dollars for head phones  i would be more satisfied with these for this price  i have definitely paid more for worse  with the proper fit  they really aren t at all bad  but given the ear buds not fitting me and to a less extent  the jack being large and right angled  i don t think i would order these again  hence the 3 stars
