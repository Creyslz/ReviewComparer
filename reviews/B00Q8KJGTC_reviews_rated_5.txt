great shelves   just dont use the drywall anchors they come with 
these are great little shelves  i m using mine for mini action figures and bobble heads  they hold up just fine  just dont use the anchors they come with  i didnt even attempt to use them  i have used better quality drywall anchors on numerous occasions and took one look at these and i instantly knew that i would never use them  just go to home depot or your local hardware store and spend a few dollars and buy your own  i have included a picture of the ones i used  i read a lot of the bad reviews and it seems that if people used better quality drywall anchors they would not be having the problems they are having  as far as instructions  what instructions  there arent any  which i will say is pretty stupid on the company s part  but a little brainstorming and you will figure it out  what i did was decide where i wanted to hang them  held up the shelf on the wall  then traced the shelves along the outer edges  then i measured how far down the holes were where the anchor will be inserted and marked it  then you just put the dry wall anchors there  screw to the proper length so that it sits flush and voila    some people said they were using these shelves to hold books and that the shelves were falling off  that s because the supplied anchors are trash  don t use them  they dont tell you the weight capacity  you need drywall anchors  like the ones i have attached  that state the weight capacity  the ones i purchased are rated to hold up to 50 lbs 
good investment
great purhase  no issues installing and so far so good with durability  hoping the shelves hold the weight since i wasn t able to find how much weight they re suppose to hold 
great shelves 
update to my original review  ok  so i didnt have the easiest time putting these up because of where they were  around the sink and all   but  i will have to add that these are actually of great quality  they ve held up  even for all the weight i ve put on them   they re a great addition to my bathroom and i honestly couldn t be happier  they re great for the price you pay  i would  however  recommend you get your own wall anchors from the hardware store or walmart  since i ve bought these  i bought another set for my bedroom and i got my own anchors from walmart  i picked up screw in anchors that hold up to 30 pounds  a pack of 8 for under  2  and i gotta tell you  that made all the difference when it came time to put these up  i realized the struggle wasn t in the instructions or the way they are  because they even include a little template for you to make it really easy  which does help   but the real struggle was the subpar anchors  if you get your own  like i did  you ll thank yourself  these are great shelves and i ve been recommending them to everyone  original review  these were alright  not the best  but not bad for the money    they were kind of a pain to hang up  even though they did come with like a template which was somewhat helpful 
perfect shelving  
perfect shelving    love the look  
five stars
the shelves are pretty good for the price 
best shelving amazing price  blown away 
i needed some shelving for my home office  i m on a budget i came across these at this time i m posting they were about  16 which got me three different shelves  the instructions were short and pretty simple  only thing is they did not say what size drill bit to use 11 64in  seemed to work the best for me  the price is unbelievable i am going to order at least one or two more sets 
incredibly easy to install
arrived very quickly  incredibly easy to install  look so great  exceeded my expectations with quality 
seamless installation  but note the dimensions
at first i was really hesitant because some reviews said these were tough to put on the wall and that they didn t hold anything or come with any instructions  first of all  due to the way they re hung  kind of like a picture frame is hung   of course they won t be able to hold more than about 8 10 lbs  max  i actually didn t use the drywall anchor hardware it came with because i didn t think it would do a good job  but the screws serve the purpose just fine  i would recommend just being aware of the exact dimensions of these shelves  because most books and plant pots  for example  will not fit  all three sizes have a depth of roughly 5   but i love the way they look and i look forward to having them for a while  and just a note  there  are  instructions with the package  in fact  they also provide a handy piece of paper with a printed guide for the exact distances between screws in the wall  you can screw the paper directly into the wall  gently tear it off  and use it again for the next shelf  haha  i used a butter knife to install mine because i didn t have anything else  but even still  the installation was seamless and easy 
the installation was really easy and all the needed hardware was included
the shelves arrived undamaged and were packaged very well  the installation was really easy and all the needed hardware was included  the instructions were easy to follow  each shelf came with its own template  this allowed me to tape each to the wall so i could figure out location and spacing before i marked anything or put holes in the wall  the color of the shelves is exactly as pictured and just what i wanted 
easy to assemble  sturdy shelves 
i bought these because i was tired of having all my skincare products and perfumes taking over my vanity area  these shelves were very easy to install due to the fact the set came with a piece of paper that measued the length of each individual shelf  which made it easy to install  not to mention these are very sturdy as well  i would highly recommend these and will look to purchase from this brand again 
incredible value for these shelves 
these shelves are more than worth the price  they took less than five minutes to install  and you only need a screwdriver and a hammer  all you have to do is mark the holes and put in your screws  the package comes with a neat piece of paper that you cut into three strips and it has the spacing premarked so that you tape the strip to the wall as your screw guide  they even provide stickers so you don t need to grab tape or anything  many reviews have mentioned that the included instructions don t make much sense  and i agree with them  you won t even need the instructions  so just throw them away  put the screws in your walls and then just slide the floating shelves over the screws and push down a little to lock them in place  they are sturdy and are working well as extra bathroom storage  i chose these to go over my toilet because the large shelf is exactly the width of the toilet  so visually  they fit well in the space  they are also truly flush mount and you cant see the screws at all  i recommend these to anyone  they re worth the price and so easy to install 
overall a good product
they re worth  15  i bought them to hold a couple of my pops  the best thing about them is that they are light and hold up well  it must be something about how they hand that make it so i didn t even need to screw them into a stud and they feel sturdy  over all i would say it was a good purchase
perfect 
these are exactly what i was looking for  they were easy to hang    i love the included hanging template to make it easier  they look great  very nice wall shelves 
i love these  they re just wide enough to store ultimanias    
i love these  they re just wide enough to store ultimanias and they sit right above my computer  however  hanging them was an absolute nightmare since there was nothing i could do to check a level since they re hung right on screws  i used a push pin setup  pushed the shelf into the wall with the pins  checked the level  then repeated until it was right  using the hole from the pin to hang my screws  they look great  and i would absolutely buy them again  i do wish they were a little wider  but for what i needed when i made the purchase i have no regrets 
five stars
very satisfied
elegant and simple
perfect for my crystals  i measured black sequin fabric and attached it to the shelves so my crystals would have a more friendly surface to lay  they look incredible  these shelves are simple  sturdy  and elegant  i like the high sides on the ends   they contain the shelf holding area and the items it holds  to an extent  it works well for my crystals  and the color is so neutral it matches anything  it s a true espresso brown  assembly is a snap  i didn t even look at the instructions  just measure the distance for the holes  mark in desired position and place screws   they include all the screws you need  it says you can use a screw driver but i would suggest a drill  it was much easier  make sure you push down on the shelf once you get it on the screws to secure it in place  this is very important  if you don t push down on the shelf and secure it it will crash and fall  i learned by doing this exact thing  lol
loves it 
i love these floating shells  sets of the decor atmosphere in my family room  just the look that i am looking for  loves it 
great wall shelves but avoid the terrible anchors provided  
i do love the final results of these wall shelves  they are quite small but it is good enough for displaying small figures  they seem pretty sturdy but i don t want to risk putting too much weight onto them  i have a 3 4oz   a 1 7 oz bottle of perfume on the medium one and it is holding on very well  downside notes  instructions was not helpful  i was sure if i needed a drill but it was definitely a lot quicker with it  like most people mentioned the anchors provided is terrible  it messes up your walls so i would say the best thing is to get another set of anchors if not they can damage your walls  it took me around 20 minutes to figure and had them install 
easy to install  looks great
these look fantastic and are very easy to install  they come with paper strips that help you measure the exact distance between the screw holes for each  which makes it much easier to put the holes in your wall at the exact right position  you want to screw the screw in like 90  before sliding the shelf over the screw head  if you leave too much space  the shelf will feel wobbly  i didn t bother using the plastic grips that you insert into the screw hole  and they still feel very sturdy  highly recommended    if you thought my review was helpful  it would be awesome if you could click  yes  below  thanks  
awesome 
i read the other reviews that the instructions were super confusing    so i was surprised when i got to read it for myself    they were very easy to understand and use  you just to have common sense   anyways the guide paper that comes with the instructions were very handy    i wouldve spent an hour trying to line up the correct lines without it  i didnt use the drywall stoppers but i did use the screws it came with  the shelves itself are very sturdy  i put all my lotions and hair care and stuff like that on them and im not worried about it falling  the shelves are a bit darker than i expected but i like them dark so i wasnt mad  very good price for them too    im very impressed    super cute too
perfect
love them  great price  and super easy installation 
great value for toy displays 
these were ludicrously easy to install  find the spot you want to place them  then slide them slightly to the side of where that is  roughly half the width of the side wings of the shelf  make a vertical notch on the wall with the head of your screwdriver to mark where the screws should be  make another line across the vertical notch to match up where the cutout screw slots on the back of the shelves are  if your screwdriver head is just a bit smaller than the diameter of the screw  just use the head of the screwdriver to gouge a starter hole in the wall  if your walls aren t too thick  like drywall  just drive your screwdriver into the wall  if you have thick walls  use a drill  always start with a much smaller drillbit than you think you need and then work your way up to a larger size if you need it  insert the anchors in the driven or drilled hole  and then just tighten the screws into the anchor about 80  of the way  pop the shelves up onto the screws and you re done  it sounds more involved than it is  if you don t have the correct tools for completing this task  your set of household tools is incomplete  don t try putting anything too heavy on these  maybe  they make great shelves for action figures  model kits  collectibles  or even dvds and blu rays 
wonderful shelves to creatively display anything your heart desires 
wonderful shelves to creatively display anything your heart desires  these things are beyond aesthetically pleasing  the shelves themselves are quite beautiful  and feel very sturdy  as others have stated  the mounting process can be a bit of a chore  the anchors they provide are flimsy at best  and the directions definitely leave something to be desired  i wouldn t take off a star just because of the mounting process  it really isn t that bad  but if you can manage to weather a little bit of mounting grief  the shelves will hang firmly in place  and add a beautiful addition to your wall decor  definitely would recommend these shelves for anyone wanting to give their wall a wonderful accent 
good  light  simple  they work
the small one is quite small  but they work very well  for the price  they are quite sturdy and well put together  the routing for mounting is clean  but not reinforced  so don t expect to put anything heavy on it  i ended up drilling a hole in the side of the small one and use it for charging my phone by the bed  the medium and large are holding light weight nick nacks above my girlfriend s desk 
easy 
these arrived on time and as expected  templates were included that made hanging these an absolute breeze  just use the included stickers to hang the included templates on the wall  drill according to the templates  rip the templates off and install the shelves on the screws  all done in less than 20 minutes  which includes using a level to line the templates up and everything   pricing seems fair for the quality   they re not the best ever  but certainly on par with ikea furniture or something similar 
very pleased 
i purchased and installed these shelves 10 months ago for my baby s room  and after almost a year i can say i would recommend these to anyone  they ve held up very well  weren t very difficult to install  although i would recommend having someone with you to help measure   and they look great  they are exactly what i was looking for and half what i was hoping to spend  i m thinking about buying more for other rooms now 
instead of nail  i use command poster strip to    
instead of nail  i use command poster strip to keep them in place  and also can be moved around if needed  i intend to use them for displaying lego  nothing heavy  so far it works really well  these shelves are handy 
attractive  easy to install 
love these shelves   so easy to install  got them up in less than 15 minutes with a stud finder  drill  and a level  they come with paper cut outs to tape to the wall so you can pinpoint where to install the screws  it was super appreciated  i ve had floating shelves before and they just made it a guessing game to measure and place the screws for them  these were a breath of fresh air  the finish is smooth and chip and scratch free  very appealing  they also fit way more stuff than i anticipated  totally cleared up my counter space  i should also note  because they fit into studs  i did not use the small plastic spacers for the screws  highly recommended 
my perfect solution to a small apartment room
love these floating shelves  super easy to install  and holds all my little do dads  i currently use the shelves as  1  to hold my tv and fire tv remotes and google home 2  as a small nightstand like thing  which holds my phone  and waterbottle  my bed has a small little dibit in the wall next to it  and this was the perfect solution for a small  table   3  to hold 5  books
easy to install 
thin shelves that helped me clear off my bathroom counter  easily holds bottles and jars of things  i store my makeup bag on one as well  i used the template to put it on the wall and didn t have any issues like others did  i even used the hardware included and didn t have any issues  however  i m not putting anything substantial on them 
great shelves 
when i found myself running out of places to put my ever growing funko pop collection i started looking at floating shelves  i m glad i happened upon these ones  they re perfect for what i needed  my pops look really cute on them  hanging above the tv in my living room  normally i loathe hanging things on my wall because i have a tough time getting them straight level  but the guides that came with these shelves was a huge help  highly recommend  i ll be picking up a second set  and maybe more  for other walls soon 
i m pretty impressed  these shelves are high quality and were    
i m pretty impressed  these shelves are high quality and were very easy to install using the built in diagrams and instructions  they are sturdy and hold books or assorted random objects well  i would recommend you have a level handy so that you can ensure they are straight as it can be a little difficult to guess at 
cool shelves easy install
great shelves  i spray painted mine and the gold color well  easy to install  they came with these stickers which im sure were to help install the nails straight but i still had to use a leveler
love these  esp  for the price  ordering more 
just received them today and they are already up  they are extremely sturdy and feel heavy duty  listened to other reviews stating not to use the screws it came with  purchased a better set at home depot  my teenage daughter s stuff was all over the bathroom  now it s all neatly on her very own shelves  i plan to order some black ones for her room soon 
clean and tidy  practical space savers
very clean and subtle  i bought these to help store my lotions and perfumes and to keep them out of reach from my toddlers  i m so glad i chose these as they are the perfect size  clean and tidy looking and don t take up too much space  they also look very nice above my white vanity mirror desk  highly recommend
perfect shot glass display
i bought 4 sets of these for shot glasses and a place to put family photos  we automatically bought different anchors than the ones that come with it  as far as instructions  you probably shouldn t be hanging floating shelves if ya need instructions for a task this obvious  we had 7 shelves up and level in about 20 minutes  it s a great alternative to expensive shot glass display cases 
perfect shelves for any modern home 
very modern look and fits perfectly on the wall  holds fairly well at half the price of an ikea shelf  product comes with a pilot sheet so you do not have to guess where to drill the holes  instructions came in clear as well  installation time took 15 minutes with figuring out how to assemble your shelves in your style being the longest  great buy for the price  pros   modern looking shelves fit perfectly on the wall  nice finish and no chips on the product  product came within two days cons   none
perfect for the price 
was a bit sketpical about these but theyre so worth the price  my only suggestion is do not waste your time with the hardware that comes with the set  screws anchors   buy from the hardware and youll be good  the instructions are crap but the pictures pretty much spell it out for you so its not difficult  all in all its a great bargain  will but buying another set 
clean simple lines easy to put up 
perfect for my use  just the right size to get vitamins off the counter  i put up with 3m command hooks  with the removable hooks i can change when ever i wish with no holes to patch  you will have to bend the hook closer together and the shelf will need a spacer at the back  a hole spacer template is included which is helpful  priced right and a simple sturdy shelf set 
awesome shelves
these are impressively sturdy  and perfect for my office space  i have all those cluttery things that clog up a desk up on these shelves instead  stapler  pen cup  etc  the strips included are ingenious  i have never had such an easy time hanging something level  
fantastic purchase
i was in the market for some floating shelves for my makeup vanity and purchased these with some hesitation due to previous reviews  i can say i am blown away by the quality and ease of installation for these shelves  the drywall screws  the white plastic ones  didn t do anything for me as i don t have a power drill so i just hammered the regular screws that were provided into the wall and screwed them in from there  my shelves are stout and the perfect mode for displaying my perfumes and trinkets  i plan on buying several more of these bad boys for the rest of my home 
i love these shelves
i love these shelves  i have them for my room  i bought them for my boyfriends bathroom  and now i just bought them for my new baby s room  they aren t as big as they appear in the picture but you can fit a lot of things on them  i just love the way they look and they re great for either storage or decor  i think i ll get some for my living room next  easy to hang on the wall too 
works for me
my original intention was to use these in my bedroom but i changed my mind  not having a medicine cabinet in my current bathroom and seeing how other buyers used these in their bathrooms convinced me to follow suit  i followed another buyers recommendation to purchase 1 4   8 wall anchors and they went up awesome  can t really complain about anything  the shelves are in fact shelving 
five stars
ordered two  six shelf s total  love them 
great quality and value
i bought these during one of the lightning deals  and they are amazing  i ended up painting the front of them to match my wall which is right next to it  and i think it really tied the whole room together  thinking about getting another set as well  unlike some other shelves i ve used  the screws which came with these are actually sturdy  for the other shelves on the teal wall  the screws which came with those literally broke off in the stud haha  we had to use our own  the good news with these shelves is  the mounting holes are very large  so any screws really will work 
love 
love love love  a million times  love  these shelves are exactly what i was looking for to get rid of stuff all over my bathroom counter  i m going to order like 3 more sets for all over my house   for easy install  mark where the screws sit on the side of the shelves and mark the top of where you want the shelf to sit on the wall and use a leveler  super quick and easy 
these work great in my craft room
these work great in my craft room  i used my own wall plugs to install since the ones provided were too flimsy  not a big deal  they arrived in good time and look lovely on my wall while being practical  i could see how these shelves would be easy to move  use new wall plugs   should you ever need to adjust their placement  i ve already bought 2 sets and am very pleased 
fantastic shelves 
i needed extra storage space in my bathroom and something to fill up the void space above the toilet  these were the perfect solution  the shelves came with mounting hardware  drywall anchors  so you can hang them anywhere  as you can tell from the picture they can hold a significant amount of weight  they re functional  classy and keep everything safe due to the raised sides  i m so glad i purchased these 
exactly what was advertised  no cracks or scratches     
exactly what was advertised  no cracks or scratches    but it s a bitch to get up  ps get bigger wall mounts 
great for tiny bathroom
a great addition to a tiny bathroom   finally able to get things up and off the tiny counter top or lid of the toilet  feels so great and looks great too   very  very  very easy to hang   only after all my measuring and marking  did i find the easy  just tape up  drill guides   verified that i d measured well  thanks 
what i expected and a little more 
this is a pretty sturdy product and very easy to install  it comes with a paper hole guide and stickers to tack them to the wall  you just find the best spot for the shelf  find the paper that coordinates with that shelf size  tack it up  and drill your guide holes  i was actually pretty surprised by that added touch and found installation to be extremely quick and painless 
i love my floating shelves
i love my floating shelves    they are made of good quality and easy to install  included step by step instructions and included almost everything you need  great price for 3 shelves and they match my decor that i was creating  i highly recommend this product and my friends are asking where i purchased it 
great little shelves
i bought these shelves from a different seller and never got them  i liked the way the shelves looked so i decided to order again but through a different seller  i got the shelves today and i m very pleased with them  i bought them with the intention of displaying some of my vape gear  they work well for what i need them for  installation was easy  so long as you toss the instructions  i had an issue getting the last long shelf on the wall  it took me a good 3 tries  but i got it to stay eventually 
great shelves for my ise
i purchased this for my walls  but its design made me use it in a different way  i have this on the side of one of my kitchen cabinets  i need some thing close for small items  it was better then having an end table 
love these 
love the simple  yet stylish design  easy install  like other reviews  if you plan on putting any significant weight on these  invest in better wall anchors    4  deep but great for my purposes 
love it
love it    it s perfect  and easy to assemble
sturdy little shelves 
these are great  i didn t use the sinkers  and they re just fine  very sturdy little shelves  they are not super huge  but are perfect for display and such  i m using them for display purposes in my bedroom for knick knack type things  i m using the medium sized one to hold a heavy cast iron tea set  and it holds it no problem 
wife loves it 
purchased these for my wife about a year or so ago  she loves how convenient and neatly placed they are  they also give us extra shelf space and easy access to the items she uses the most  very easy to put up and take down
