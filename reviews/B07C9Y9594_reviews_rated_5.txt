sounds good and stays put
wow  i really like these wireless earbuds what makes them so great is that the acoustics are really outstanding and the buds stay comfortably in place in your ear and don t fall out like other ear buds i have tried  they are stable in your ear because they use the contours of your ear to hold them in place  unlike some earbuds  they don t have a piece of plastic that wraps around the outside of the ear which makes them uncomfortable to use if you wear glasses nor do they just wedge into your ear canal  instead there is a soft piece of plastic that gently lodges into the fold of your ear  they don t fall out when i run while delivering excellent sound  of course these earbuds pair easily with my iphone as i would expect  as to battery life  i usually have a daily walk around the lake in my city  over 10 miles   about 3 5 hours  and the rechargeable battery has never given me a problem  they are very light weight and have a small magnet in each ear bud so when not in use they stay together in an organized way  they do everything ear buds should do and don t do any of the things ear buds shouldn t do 
beautiful piece of workout equipment 
i really like these headphones  they arrived already charged up and came with extra ear buds and a neat little carrying case  connecting to my iphone for the first time was super easy and reconnecting is as easy as turning them on  i am not sure exactly how long the battery lasts but i believe it ran out of battery faster when i made a call  it seems the battery lasts pretty long if you just listen to music  i just recharge after i come from a run while i take a shower  the sound is satisfactory  don t expect beats sounds with them but for the money and convenience  they sound very very good  they are voice activated so you are alerted when you connect to your phone and when you receive a phone call  it will tell you the number that is calling then it rings  i like this feature because i am using mostly during my workouts and i use a running belt so i dont see the screen of my phone  during my runs  i put the cable in front of me not back of my neck  it is my choice but it seems it stays in place better in that way  something to keep in mind 
i love these headphones
i love these headphones  i was amazed by the sound quality as it was nice and clear  i even made some phone calls with it and it worked wonderfully  i liked how the volume buttons were big as i could see the clearly and they were easy to push as well as the smaller ones can be hard  the earpiece was stable when i was running in the park on some steep hills which is important to me as i have had other wireless headphones fall out of my ears and it is a hassle putting them in all the time but these ones stayed in very well  the earpiece is also very comfortable as i had them in for over an hour when i was running in the park  i really like how the ear wings are labeled with an r for the right ear and an l for the left ear as it makes it nice and easy to put the correct ear wing on and it is great how there are different size ear wings and ear tips to ensure and proper fit  lastly i love how classy they look and how they magnetize together as i can keep them around my neck and won t loose them  overall these are great headphones  especially for the price 
read the instructions carefully and have a magnifying glass handy though 
these bluetooth headphones are incredible  i really like the way they fit inside of the ear  very comfortable  there s other sized ear pieces for correct fitting inside of the ear to hold it nicely and softly  doesn t fall out either  the curved peices you see are soft rubber and can be rotated to the proper place to fit inside of ear curves  it has a really clear sound and nice bass  i would recommend these to anyone who is busy and cannot have the plug in headphones  i can walk away from my phone to about 30 feet before any connection loss happens  it also has a magnets in the other end of ear bud  which is handy if you move around alot  great for working out or driving  this is much better than the hard bluetooth headphones that tend to fall out of the ears  the instructions to pair could be a little bit better as it doesn t tell you to hold button until the blue light comes on  i wasn t holding it long enough to detect the headphones  all worked out well and these really are nice headphones 
very nice headphones  i already had a set of bose    
very nice headphones  i already had a set of bose headphones  but decided to get another one because my boyfriend always keeps stealing mine    plus they were a little too bulky for me  these on the other hand     when i first opened the box  they come in a nice little sturdy container   i was relieved to find that the buds weren t too big  i have pretty small ears and it s a pain in the neck to find anything the fits  i put the smallest attachments on and they fit perfectly  in fact  they fit so well that the buds created a vacuum and made a little suction noise when i pushed them into my ear  the earbuds themselves are very comfortable and surprisingly light without looking cheap  they charged pretty fast  there s a little led indicator that allows you to monitor their charging  finally for the sound  i m not particularly a pro  but i thought they sounded just as well as my bose earbuds  and at a fraction of the price  overall  happy with this purchase 
that s great for phone
i m a recent convert to trying two ear bluetooths as i have been using one for quite some time  that s great for phone  but not so much for riding my exercise bike  walking  or playing poker  these connected quickly to my galaxy s9  and the sound is super  the in my ear works well for me as i need a lot of clarity on my sound  folks on the other end of my calls also heard me well  all in all very impressed by the sound quality  they store nicely with the magnet which keeps everything untanbled  on my desk  or around my neck  the long charge  i got well over a day  close to two full days  without continuous use  is a plus  i get far less from my jabra stealth  i am very happy  and would recommend to anybody looking for a quality sound source at a very reasonable price 
fantastic quality bluetooth headphones for an affordable price
after using the same pair of  150 bluetooth headphones for the last 5 years  they had started to lose their charge  so i decided to try these dodocool headphones out  when i first put these headphones in my ears  they weren t quite snug enough  however  these came with small  medium and large sizes of replacement ear pieces  so i switched the default pieces out for the larger ones  and it made a big difference  color me impressed  the sound quality on these headphones is equal  if not better to my old headphones  i can hear trebles  mids and lows  the bass in the headphones is also quite good for bluetooth in ear headphones  these also stay in my ears a lot better than my previous set of headphones as well  and being able to control the volume and skip tracks is pretty essential  so i m glad that is built in too  i definitely recommend this product  at this price  it s pretty much a steal 
 listening 
these magnetic earbuds are awesome  they come with a small  medium  large size ear hooks and cushions  the earbuds cord length is 20  long  i get about seven hours of continuous pandora radio with no skipping  it also comes with a 19  charging cable and a really nice storage case  the earbuds take about two hours to fully charge from 0  and besides not skipping during my music i really like that these are soft touch and don t stick out too far from my head and that they are my favorite colors  the instruction manual was pretty average and the description photos are accurate  when you first pair these with your phone hold the button until it flashes red and blue then you can find it on bluetooth devices  the sound quality is excellent and i m super happy with my new earbuds  i hope this helps you 
great sound and noise cancellation headphones 
these lightweight and comfortable headphones really are amazing  the bass response is deep and highs are crisply pronounced  i can wear them while using my treadmill and they say put in my ears with the provided flexible inside hooks  when i take them out the magnetic backs hold them around my neck so they won t fall off  the bluetooth connected very easily and fast with my phone  tablet and pc  just hold down the center button until the led flashes red blue and it will pop up on your bluetooth menu  i love the nice zipper case it comes with that offers secure protection plus a cool little elastic cargo net spot for the manual  mini usb and extra ear pads and hooks  i recommend these great lightweight headphones if your looking for ease of use  great sound and cool travel pouch design  5 stars 
great set of wireless earbuds 
i ve been wanting to try wireless  bluetooth  earbuds for a while  i go the gym on a regular basis and always get frustrated at getting the earbud cord tangled while running  sometimes  i would be running and the earbuds on my wired earphones would fall out  with these wireless earbuds  i don t have to worry about that problem anymore  the sound quality is pretty good for the price that you pay as well  the earbuds have a cushion similar to that of skull candy  as opposed to apple earbuds   i would definitely make this purchase again in the future if needed and will suggest this product to my friends and family  it is easy to pair with just a volume button and a multifunction button  for power on off  pairing  end call etc  
great sound quality
so far im highly impressed with these headphones   the sound quality is really great  especially for the price  you do need to read the instructions in order to learn how to use them  since the home button basically does everything from answering a phone call to syncing with bluetooth  i love the magnet on the earpieces  so if you arent using them  you can connect them to each other around your neck  very cool  the only downside is the one i received had a short in one of the wires  the seller was easy to work with though   promised to send a replacement to me  so for the price  id say these are a great deal  if you get a faulty one like i did  the seller does seem to stand behind their products 
perfect quality  great place  value for sure 
extremely pleased with these headphones  can t say enough good things about it  first off the design  looks very high quality and has a sleek  sporty look  i like how the buttons are large and raised for easy use without looking  and the headphones power on off quickly  i have also never had trouble with connecting  they usually connect to my phone instantaneously upon turning them on  the sound quality is crisp and clear  and the comfortable design forms a seal around your ears  which cancels noise very well  i have never had trouble with them falling out and they have never showed signs of trouble  even after being exposed to a lot of sweat during cardio sessions  all in all  these are very good reliable headphones 
these earphones work great 
these earphones are amazing  i have a very athletic and active 15 year old  my son needed a great pair of ear buds  i purchased these and he loves them  he can run and workout and these are comfortable  besides being wireless which helps to not get in his way  the earphones are very comfortable  they sit inside the ear but the ear piece is soft and flexible  it helps to make the earphones stay out but does not feel uncomfortable like many with hard plastic  it took my son about a half hour to completely get used to the feeling and since then he loves them  the sons quality is great and there is hardly any noise coming from his ears 
great overall quality
the overall quality is very nice  impressive black oval zipper case with red zipper matching the earphones  the larger buttons makes it easy to manage the multi function middle button quickly  pairing  pause  play and answering calls  easy pairing and great sound quality  the lobe fins keep the plugs in firmly  i like the magnetic strength that will no doubt keep the device looped around the neck with confidence when not in use  the initial charge took about 30 minutes to fullness indicated by a light change from red to blue  it seems long lasting but have not fully tested that aspect yet 
very pleased 
these are really cool  i recently bought a pixel 2 and it doesn t have a place to plug in my earbuds  so i ordered these  the case is very nice and comes with a pocket to hold the usb cord and extra ear pieces for a proper fit  the earbuds are comfortable when in the ear and i love the magnetic feature so i can keep it around my neck without fear of losing them  very nice sound  the bass sounded great  it is very hard to hear outside noises with the headphones in  i could not hear someone talking right next to me  overall  very pleased with this purchase 
really awesome  comfortable headphones 
super quick ship  they arrived yesterday and i have been using them all morning  pairing was simple   just put your phone into pairing mode and hold the multi function button down for 6 seconds  very easy to use  sound quality is really good  for this price  it works for me   they come with different size plugs and the curved rubber pieces for a custom fit  i ve worn them all morning and i literally forgot i was wearing them  the case is nice and compact  fits in my purse without taking up a ton of real estate  i wish the cord was black or a neutral color  highly recommend 
comfortable  good sound and good fit 
light weight  but good quality  the bright red colors help it to stand out a little more which i really appreciate  the case that it comes with it really nice to have because the netting actually holds the cables in place  which the other headphones i have tried before did not have that  it charges quickly and the magnets work to hold the headphones together when they are not in use  this is a great feature that i never would have thought of but really appreciate because i don t have to worry about them falling and getting lost  the sound is great and they are comfortable 
lightweight and with great sound 
could not be happier with this purchase  the case is cool  it s always a great surprise when you order one thing  only to open the box and see something you weren t expecting  it was super easy to pair them with my android phone  they re very lightweight and quite comfortable  the cord is just the right length  round cross section  and it doesn t pull and grab on your neck like some  loved using it during my work out  my favorite color is red and love the color on this headphone  all in all i m very happy with my purchase and if something happens to these i will definitely buy again 
love the battery life 
i really like these earbuds  first  the  fin  and the angle do a great job of keeping the ear bud in place  i use these at work where i m cleaning and moving medical equipment  my old pair kept falling out to a point where the noise cancelling was not effective  or it would fall out all the way into dirty equipment  big and gross problem    the noise cancelling works well  the sound quality is excellent for the price point  the battery life is amazing   i get almost a full day out of these  overall  i would absolutely buy them again 
low price  high quality
i love the sound with these  i own a very high end pair  and so far  can t tell the difference in the sound  and this one has more features  like the magnet  brilliant  why didn t someone think of this ages ago     i lost my first pair  had it draped over my neck  thought it was secure       not so much  i also use audible  a lot  to listen to books  and these work well for that  too  some of these headphones have too much bass and it s difficult to understand a book  not a problem here  finally  i like the red cord  another help for keeping track of them  recommend 
good bluetooth distance
sounds quality is really good  it took a couple of tries to connect it the first time  however  i think it was just the learning quality  the sound quality is better than my other head phones  treble notes are a little muffled sounding  as a sound guy   i can actually move away from my phone and it still works  the default ear pieces are on the larger side  however there is another set in the case that are smaller  the case seems very nice and roomy  i own another pair of bluetooth headphones that work pretty good  these are as good 
these wireless headphones are great 
im so impressed with these headphones  they charged quickly with the cord included and synced to my iphone with no problems  the sound is great and they really are noise canceling  i like that they can be used to talk on my phone  too  they come with a nice little case that will fit in most any size purse or pack so headphones wont get damaged  also comes with different size earbuds so you have a perfect fit  the instructions are in extremely small print but once read with a magnifying glass  im 60  yrs   the use is easy  i would recommend 
fantastic headphones for nice price
these are pretty awesome headphones  no  they are not as good as my  200 bose ones  but they do a fantastic job of drowning out annoying co workers who like to sing and drum in the office  also tested them out on the elliptical   i always get super sweaty while pushing hard intervals and these headphones stayed put  love it  fits comfortable and snuggly in the ear  i also like the fact that they come with a hard shell case to protect them in my gym bag  super easy to pair with my ipad  i would recommend these for the price 
these headphones have really good sound to them and come with a nice case
these headphones have really good sound to them and come with a nice case  there are also different sized earbuds inside for you to custom it however you need  i like that it has the ear wings to help stay in my ear when i am running  i try to make my reviews as honest and thorough as possible  so that another person can know exactly what they would get  if my review was helped you at all in your considering this product please hit the yes button below  it really helps amazon know people are reading the reviews 
better quality
i really like this bluetooth  the directions are not clear on how to pair it    turn on the bluetooth  start the scan on your phone  hold down the multifunction button for 2  seconds  the device will pair   i have a different bluetooth device that makes speaker microphone noises everyone i move my head  this device does not  it comes with 3 pairs of in ear rubbers and 3 outer ear rubber guides  the sound quality is good and i had no issues being heard  i like the carry case that comes with it also 
perfect for active wear
these are the first headphones like these i ve used  my spouse has gone through several pairs  though  so i had him try these  too  the sound quality is excellent  i used them to listen to an audio book  then music  the music was great   it played through the headphones without any hiccups  the audio book had problems and the audio would  pulse through the ear pieces to the point that i couldn t listen anymore  however  i was listening to it at 1 75x normal speed and once i slowed it back to normal speed  the problems went away  it turned out to be the audio file  but it was frustrating while troubleshooting  problem solved and a new book didn t have any problems with  pulsing  so i know it was that particular file  the cord length is great   just right for multitasking  working out  in the yard  etc  without fear of them getting caught on something  i m pretty happy with them 
for under  30 these are a good buy
good inexpensive set of headphones  pros  magnet keeps the two buds together when not in your ears  carrying case  molded buttons let you feel which button is which without looking  and about 6 7 hrs of battery with a 1 5 hr charge time  they are also loud and surprisingly bassy  cons  noise canceling seems a gimmick  and instructions are barebones  for less than  30 i wouldn t be too concerned  these are worth the money as a backup set or something to take on a long flight 
great little bluetooth headphones
these were a hit for me  the sound was pretty good  cord was a good length  the ear pieces fit well in my ears  i loved the case it came with so i can take it to the gym in a small pouch without it getting lost in between my gym clothes  magnetic so they can attach together around my neck when not in use and they won t fall off  only negative i found was initially they were a little more difficult to pair with my iphone  i ll be using these for a while hopefully    
immediately connects to bluetooth  no issues 
i have had difficulty pairing bluetooth devices to my iphone  i don t know what the issue is  but this doesn t give me that problem  it immediately connects  i love that this is able to stay in my ears throughout my hiit workouts and is able to keep up with me  the wire itself doesn t get all twisted like my other ones  nothing is more annoying when it twists up behind your neck because it gets caught up in my ponytail  i love these and i m so happy with my purchase
best hadohones so far 
i have only tried these at the gym twice  but i am loving these  firstly  they fit better in my ears and they dont fall out like my last set with similar earpeices  the cord is also softer  so it doesnt tug or cause the earpiece to move twist while you are  the inly thing that is not complete is the noise canceling feature  i can still hear voices and the piped gym music  but other than that  i really like these  they also come with a nice case to put them in 
pretty good and light 
these do not fit as expected  i thought the loop would go around my ear  it doesn t it goes inside  but works well  i tryed the on and i m a lot happier than i thought i would be  they aren t super loud  but they are louder than most i have tryed and are pretty clear for the price  i own an expensive pair that has the plastic piece around the neck  i hate those because they fall off when i m benching  these are light and won t do that 
this bluetooth headset came in a really nice storage case
wow  this bluetooth headset came in a really nice storage case  music sounds great  they charge lasted a little over 8 hrs  they are comfortable in the ear even with sensitive ears as mine  the hooks give added support so the buds don t fall out  i like the magnet fasteners so the headset can remain around the neck when not in use without getting lost  they easily paired with my iphone  there was one con    the directions are in really small print that i needed a magnifying glass to read them 
bargain headphones for how well it works
i am quite happy with this purchase  considering the price paid for the headphones  they work very well  the connection to bluetooth was very simple and the sound from the headphones is great  the headphones stay right in the ear and to my surprise  the noise cancellation actually drowned out the outside noise  i would buy them again if i lost these and recommend them to those looking for a quality bluetooth headphones 
my dad loves it 
i bought these for my dad because it got irritating whenever he was driving and got a phone call he would just reach for it and endanger everyone in the car  thank goodness for these we can all rest comfortably knowing he will be driving safely  and these pair very well with the iphone 7 and up  the only thing left to do at this point is think of the next great gift for the upcoming mother s day 
very pleased 
finally a pair of headphones that work to block sound  these are noise canceling for sure and it was so convenient they came with a carrying case and additional buds to fit my smaller ears  also the control on the cord is perfect for vol and song control  ive jumpped rope  done burpees  and yoga head stands and these things dont fall out  i felt a review was essential with these  very pleased 
nice packaging  case
nice packaging  case  different sized ear pieces  charging cord  instructions etc  headphones charged very quickly  very easy to pair device  great sound quality  very comfortable in the ear  buttons on unit easy to operate and feel  volume up down   very impressed with the quality of these headphones at a fraction of the price of others  highly recommend this product  very pleased  
    different bluetooth headphones and it seems to the the best one yet
these headphones are probably my 4th different bluetooth headphones and it seems to the the best one yet  they slide in comfortably in my ears and they don t fall out when i play basketball  the bass is pretty decent for being small headphones and doesn t  break  the music  i am no expert but they seem like a good set for sport and gym in general and it comes with a small case which is nice  will update if there are any issues with it 
aesthically pleasing  lightweight  buttons you can actually press
the bundled ear caps and ear hooks are actually practical and fit according to your ear lobe hole size  magnetic feature is cool but doesn t provide much since this pair comes with a small case  couldn t really tell the difference between a pair without the noise cancelling and this pair  especially since they are in ear headphones  paired right away with my wifes iphone 6s 
all around solid product
these headphones were great  with the multiple pieces i found one that fits perfectly  the color was great  i really love red and black together and these were no exception  in addition people do buy headphones for the sound  the sound was super clear on these  i am very happy i bought them and will probably get another pair just to have as a back up for the gym
i love the fact that the buttons are easy to feel which is which 
great fit  i love the fact that the buttons are easy to feel which is which  no guess work  they work great  have great sound quality and feel great  the only thing that surprised me was how they stick out of your ear  they stick out a lot  though it is not uncomfortable because they are lightweight  mine came fully charged  great buy  nice little pouch to keep them safe too 
money well spent
an avid runner and fitness junkie  i was excited to put these to the test  i cant tell you the number of headphones ive tried out  including big name brands  and hated  if they dont stay in your ears whats the point  i am very pleased with these little gems  easy to carry in your purse  fast sync and best of all they stay put    well worth the investment 
    is the second bluetooth headphones i ve purchased and they re pretty good  it has clear sound quality for music    
this is the second bluetooth headphones i ve purchased and they re pretty good  it has clear sound quality for music and audible audiobooks  once i get used to bluetooth headphones  i can t go back to those old fashioned wired headphones  they are light light and comfortably fit to my ears  nice pair of affordable bluetooth headphones and highly recommended 
headphones with great features 
these headphones are great for the price  first and most importantly   the sound is great  canceling out some outside noise  they fit very nicely in the ear and are very comfortable  they won t fall out very easy  the magnetic feature on the buds is great so you won t lose them  comes with usb charger and lasts for about 8 hours  zip everything up in a nice carry case  give them a try 
spend the  30 on these  they are worth it 
i usually go pretty cheap on headphones but i knew that i wanted to get some bluetooth ones for working out and just to have around my neck  i saw the description and reviews and thought i d take a chance on these  they are awesome and i don t know how i could listen to my music without having a pair of these  love the price for the amazing quality  they sound awesome 
my new gym buddy 
i love these  they are very light weight and small profile  easy to keep in  the carrying case that they come in is super convenient also  i just throw them in my gym back and don t have to worry about them getting all tangled up with stuff in my bag  easy to operate and the instructions are very straight forward  very happy with my purchase 
i m picky and these are amazing 
these are amazing  i am a sound audio enthusiast  so usually stay away from the wireless headphones due to poor quality  these  however  greatly surprised me and surpassed expectations  very comfortable  great spectrum of sound  long battery  have yet to run them out  awesome product 
excellent earbuds 
what a great pair of earbuds  shipped fast  easy to use  nice sound  i can definitely notice the noise cancellation feature which makes the music even more enjoyable  the bass is just right to me  not too overpowering  vocals sound clear and crisp  bonus   i didn t expect it  but they come in a nice storage case 
really nice and good sound quality
i was looking for decent earbuds to use at the gym because my other ones were cheap and wired and just didn t fit right in my ears  i was always pushing them back in or adjusting them  these are really nice  they are bluetooth which is a plus and they even come with extra ear hooks of different sizes  the sound quality is pretty good too  overall  i m satisfied with the purchase and recommend them to anyone looking for decent earbuds 
great bluetooth headphones  secure and comfortable 
a solid bluetooth headset im really enjoying  i like the soft silicone ear piece  comfortable and doesnt fall out  good sound  maybe a bit heavy on the bass  but appropriate sound at the price level  i hadnt realized it would come with a nice zippered case  that will be handy and looks sharp 
excellent product  competitive with name brand for sure 
amazing what quality you can get these days without having to pay a lot  makes me regret spending so much on those name brand headphones in years past  excellent sound quality and range  plenty of volume which even the more expensive brands always seem to lack  easy to setup and comfortable to boot 
nice set of headphones 
these headphones are a lot clearer then wired plugin headphones  i plugged them into charge watched a movie and then have been listening to an audio book off and on all afternoon and they feel comfortable in the ear and are still running  excellent for gym use as well would definitely recommend this product they are light and easy to theow in your gym bag with out having to worry about a tangled mess 
good sound quality good price 
poor instruction  good quality sound  the bass is good for such a small ear bud  i listen to them in the office and on 1 bar of volume they are a bit loud but that is probably due to the noise cancelling  crystal clear sound  remember to hold the on button until its descovered for pairing 
parents loved
these work great  i had gotten a different brand of these for myself but my parents have been asking for wireless headphones  i thought these would be a good fit because they re magnetic and they work great sound quality was nice when i tried them out and my parents had no complaints
good price for a sturdy product with great sound 
love how sturdy and durable the wires are on this headset because i plan to use it for listening to music as i run  it is easy to use  for phone calls i like the sound on my end and those i m speaking with have commented on the clear crisp sound on their end  great phone for the price 
quality bluetooth earphones
these headphones work great  the quality of the build is really sturdy and nearly identical to my  name brand  earphones  the sound is great and the buds fit nice and snug in my ears  i think these are a great value and the connection to my phone was really easy 
i really like that they provide a case to store everything
i really like that they provide a case to store everything  the charging light indicator is a bit small and not as noticeable  very comfortable fit  the only thing i didnt like is that even with my iphone being on 1 bar volume  the actually volume is a bit higher than i would like 
great affordable bluetooth earbuds 
this is the 2nd pair of bluetooth earbuds i ve owned and so far they re pretty perfect  quality feels really good  i m happy with sound quality for listening to music and audiobooks  if you re an audiophile you may want to go more expensive  but then you probably don t want earbuds either  these are great for working out and everyday use so far  i ll update this review if my opinion changes with use but right now i d highly recommend them for the price 
great price  great sound  great product
these headphones are excellent at blocking out background noise and fit very comfortably in my ears  these are very lightweight and do not pull on your ears  these headphones are excellent to travel with since they come with a very nice case that they can go into when you are not using them and they won t get tangled or damaged  the sound quality is also excellent with these 
great headphones at a great price
quality built  sturdy and great sounding headphones  included is a convenient carrying case  the magnetic option is perfect to keep them around your neck when  adjustable ear pieces that fit great  these are a great headphone for biking and jogging

in love with them
these are perfect  i was excited when i opened them and the came with a cute little case  i have small ears and they are so comfortable and what is not to love about bluetooth   the quality is perfect for the price and love the red and black color 
good sounds
i bought these for my husband because he works outside and these headphones are the best so far  usually the ones he was using dropped calls or there was some sort of static sounds but not with these  he sounds clear and he can hear clearer  a good buy 
worth the little extra dollars   no regrets
nice  very nice   crisp sound  magnextic ends are a huge plus no more lost headphones i simply put the phones around my neck and put the ends together to hold in place  they have a pretty nice range of distance too  about 20 feet  
i checked them out to make sure they were good  sounds quality is top notch
got these headphones as a gift for a friend  before giving them  i checked them out to make sure they were good  sounds quality is top notch  connecting to my phone was easy  and the case is a plus for storing them  i think she ll like them just as much as i did
they are great for the price 
these are perfect for my gym sessions  good range and good battery life  the case is a nice touch  small and elegant  i don t understand people who spend 150  on headphones for 3 4 hour use a week  they are decent audio quality and you also cannot expect super quality from such a small set  they are great for the price 
nice headphones for the money 
theses are very nice headphones for the price  they have a well balanced sound  not too heavy on the bass  they fit nicely and the chord is heavy duty  i will update this review to say how well the battery lasts over time 
great sound
very nice pair of inexpensive bluetooth headphones  the sound quality of these is very good and i love that there bluetooth and the batteries lasted longer than expected  they also came in a very nice little carrying case 
product is worth the money 
the bluetooth pairing works with my phone well and my computer s bluetooth card  the controls are pretty simple and intuitive  the audio quality is great and once you switch out the adjustable ear pieces to be comfortable  they fit great  i personally had to go with the large cups and regular sized long bit  they are lightweight  and the magnetic ends let you wear them as a necklace while not in use 
great carrying case included 
i really like this style of headphone  the type that fit right into the ear  and they came with a handy little case that zips up and keeps everything together  i m constantly losing bits and pieces  and this will really help 
i absolutely love these headphones
i absolutely love these headphones  i cant believe how great the sound is that comes out of them  they even came with an extra set of earbuds and a travel case  i would definitely recommend these   great buy
