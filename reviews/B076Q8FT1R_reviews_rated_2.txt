constant filliping and hard to close fully 
didn t seem very windproof  we get a lot of wind when it rains and every time this umbrella flipped inside out  and when it does it s a bit of a pain to push back into place  maybe the  10 rods premium fiberglass  are there to make sure it can do that constantly without breaking  but still  if it says windproof i expect it to not turn inside out  plus  it was very difficult to push back in when you closed it  i had to hold it against my stomach and use a lot of strength to get it to close completely  good price for the size though 
not wind resistant
umbrella is nice  but it is definitely not wind resistant  my first time using it and i work in san francisco  when i was on my way there walking to the bart station in fremont the umbrella just flipped inside out within seconds of using it  it cannot handle wind  i got this because its extremely windy in san francisco  what a failure
