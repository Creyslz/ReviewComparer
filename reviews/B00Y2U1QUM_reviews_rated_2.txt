powerful but poor quality machine
i purposely waited a bit to write this review to see if this item would hold up  and unfortunately it did not  as for the power and ability to make a great smoothie  it is fantastic  however  it is a cheap piece of plastic except for the motor and wears out very easily  the blade assembly that you insert into the motor must be situated exactly right  if not  it could easily strip the unit  this is what happened to me  basically rendering the unit useless  i called ninja since this is well within warranty but was told the warranty was for the motor only and a blade replacement was not available  however  they would be willing to replace the whole unit for the cost of the blade assembly which was  39 99 plus  6 99 shipping and sales tax  so basically  i would be paying another  49 99 for a replacement unit that i already paid  69 99 for back in january  and probably would not last anyway  it makes no sense to me and i won t do it 
disappointing smoothie maker
pro s  inexpensive small base takes up less space blend in the same drinking container so you only wash 1 container con s  no speed selection  it s on or off and you need to push down and hold the container to blend its useless if you like smoothies on the thicker side  the blade design doesn t work well for thick ingredients it doesn t  blend  very well and leaves clumps and chunks of unmixed ingredients  even if you extend blend time  the lid leaks if it s not sealed very tightly it s very noisy loud summary  i liked the nutri bullett much better for making thicker smoothies and the vitamix is the best  but pricey  
but at first it worked fine  and now i have to play around with    
i can t figure out how to contact seller  but at first it worked fine  and now i have to play around with it to get it to work  i press down and nothing happens  this has been going on for the past couple days and i have only had this for a couple weeks 
leaky lid
i bought a new ninja because my old one started leaking during the blending process after 3 or 4 years of use  unfortunately  my brand new one leaks into the machine every time i use it  if it weren t for this i would like the product because it blends well  i m just not going to be happy spending more money replacing the lid or the whole system yet again 
i purchased this item to replace magic bullet of 600    
i purchased this item to replace magic bullet of 600 watts  the product feels and is durable and does what the description says  from previous experience with ninja products  it only operates with constant pressure  with this product i sometimes have to apply pressure several times to turn it on and it will turn off on its own  i think it s a manufacturing  defect  also  it is very loud and had to return it today and purchased a magic bullet 1000 watt 
sharkninja i hope you can help me with the noise problem 
nutri ninja pro  bl456  this is my third 900 watt ninja pro in four years   2 is beginning to burn out  smell for the last week  and because i use the ninja for a smoothie every morning   primarily berries  protein powder  half an apple cut in pieces  protein powder and other small odds and ends   i got  3 so i wouldn t have to miss my smoothies while waiting for another blender after  2 finally goes  the product works well for me  so i m willing to stay with it in spite of the relatively short longevity with regular  but light use  i tried  3 for the first time this morning and the noise was so ear piercing that it was all i could do to keep using it the relatively short time necessary to blend my smoothie  perhaps i didn t perceiver long enough  because  though blended adequately  i don t think it was blended as well as my previous ninjas  again  i may not have kept at it long enough    but the noise   also  sadly  3 isn t made as well as previous ones  i will be returning this one but don t want to have to give up on the product  i hope sharkninja can offer me a quieter ninja pro 900 watt  i do hope this one is an anomaly 
terribly loud  no returns policy
read the return policy  you cannot return it  and if you live alone and don t have to be concerned about waking everyone in the house  it s ok  but if you happen to want a smoothie late while you re up working or watching tv  or even during the day while your child is taking a nap  forget it  but i don t live alone  and while up late working i made myself a smoothie and woke everyone in the house with the terribly loud noise  when i pressed down on the top to start it  it scared the bejeezus out of me  i made the mistake of not reading the return policy  so i m stuck with the thing until spring when i can stick it in a yard sale  i should ve shopped at walmart  where i could ve returned it
only good for one and half month
it was great for a month  i was having a good time for making smoothie drinks  but after a month and half  it suddenly stop working anymore
