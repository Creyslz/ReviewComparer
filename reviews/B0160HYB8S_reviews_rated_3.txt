update  they made things right   
update  the company made things right with me  they did send a replacement umbrella fulfilling the lifetime warranty  it was important for me to let them know that the umbrella after only a few uses in 10 months had broken  i did send video in an email so they knew the product had really broken  they processed and sent a replacement right away  i do appreciate their efforts because my other automatic umbrella that ive had for at least 10 years that still works great is too big for travel  thanks guys     
decent umbrella compromised by poor quality rivets
the umbrella appears to be robust  i used it recently during rain and gusty winds in new york with no problems  however  though the ribs seem largely rustproof  i am disappointed to see visible rusting at a couple of the rivets where sections of the ribs are joined  in one case offsetting to the fabric of the umbrella  it makes no sense to me to construct a good frame from rust resistant materials only to sacrifice that quality with cheap rivets  im disappointed  though ill keep this 
nice while it lasted
it s ok  the build quality seemed nice at first  it s certainly not flimsy and it can hold up to strong winds  however  after only using it a few times  the hinges that hold the fabric are starting to rust and i can no longer collapse it without significant effort  it appears the outer metal tube of the handle is getting jammed on the inner one when i push it to lock   if it doesn t collapse all the way  it can t be re opened  so i m always worried that it won t close and i ll be left without an umbrella  considering i ve only used it about 6 times  i m very disappointed 
nice  but annoying
update  they immediately emailed me apologizing for the umbrella not meeting my full expectations  they offered a full refund or a replacement  i declined both options because the umbrella wasn t broken and a replacement would have the same issue  they issued a refund anyway with their apologies needless to say  this company truly stands behind their products  if only all companies were like this one  nice but annoying  i like the automatic open close feature but it s a pain when you only want to close it temporarily  it won t stay up unless you completely compress it to its original position which is a little difficult if you re carrying other things 
i was a bit disappointed in the quality of the shaft handle
while this umbrella does it s job and dries quickly  i was a bit disappointed in the quality of the shaft handle  i believe that will be the weak point of this umbrella  also  the button to open close umbrella is a bit hard to push  it is still a nice umbrella  but for the price  i expected it to be more substantial  update  i want to update this review to reflect the wonderful customer service i received from this company  while i did not ask for it  they were quick to issue me a refund for this item which amazon did promptly  i would deal with this company again if for nothing more than their awesome customer service
