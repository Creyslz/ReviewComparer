exactly as advertised  fully functional for great price 
exactly what i was told that i would get  was it the greatest computer ever built  no  was it an very very good computer for a very very low price  yes  yes it was  i got it as a christmas present for my mom  i fits all of her computer needs  streams video just fine  smooth and quiet functioning  nothing bad  wifi  wireless printing  noisiness  slow boot up and command response time were my worries  not problems on any of those fronts  it is a more than adequate computer for someone who isn t gaming their way through the internet or doing 100 000 things at once  it works properly and came with everything that it was supposed at an extremely reasonable price  and that is what i wanted  enough said 
very fast basic computer  at great price 
bought this to replace a 9 year old dell that was running windows vista  so it was time  i hesitated to get only a core 2 duo  since there are other faster ones  but after reading some of the reviews  and knowing that i only need to do basic web surfing  facebook  word processing  spreadsheets and emails  i thought  how bad can it be for  103   i am so pleased with it  took it out of the box  read the  read this first  sheet inside the box  hooked it up and turned it on  registered the windows 10 software and was up and running in about 20 minutes  this computer is screaming fast compared to the old one and i haven t had a single problem with it  blair technologies seems like a great seller and i had very fast shipping  i highly recommend this computer 
excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group    
excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group to deal with  they will answer any questions and help with any issues  the win 10 installed works flawlessly and the computer looks essentially new  i like that it is not a tower but has a small footprint that allows it to be laid flat on the table  it has foot pads to allow that  the cd dvd drive will work better in that horizontal layout  you can put small items on the top of it since there are no air vents on the top or bottom  i have my modem and router sitting there  while it will work wirelessly  i prefer the easy ethernet wired hookup and use the wireless for my printer  a laptop  tablet  tv  chromebook  etc  with the ethernet connection i get high speeds in spite of the heavy use of the wireless for all those other uses   easy to install and the connections are obvious  no mike or camera but those with a usb connection are very inexpensive and work just fine  good product  excellent price and good support  what s not to like for a little over  100  
best of its class    
came with extras and had more storage than expected  smooth  smelled so good that i opened the case and smelled everything  no dust  looks like it came from the factory  well packaged  highly recommend  also comes with keyboard in mouse  doesnt say in description but it does  no bluetooth tho     but it is wireless which is good  personally best of its class 
great computer for a great price

great deal at a great price  
i love the new system  it works better than i could ask for  product was packaged well and arrived before the estimated arrival time than was given when shipped  i was very happy about that because it arrived on friday  all in all great deal  nicely built system  i feel that it was a very nice bargain for the price  thank you to amazon and the seller both for hooking me up with a great deal 
  he was very humorous and easy to talk to
i was tentative about the purchase of this computer  it did only last a month prior to the hard drive going out  however  the seller company was so responsive to my problem  he tried to walk me thru troubleshooting  no small task on his end to teach this technologically stunted girl how to work on a hard drive problem   he was very humorous and easy to talk to  and when he decided that the hard drive was  toast   he immediately sent me a new and better one  he was willing to help me again  but i decided to take it to the geek squad  i have geek squad protection  so it was no cost to me   now the computer is working wonderfully 
it s solid all the way around
im pleased boots fine  os is functional no lag  i was kind disappointed there was no built in wifi but a wireless adapter usb thing is provided so its not a big deal  pretty pleased with this great computer for the price  that being said i ll probably buy another

an awesome product that was exactly what was needed
this is a very simple  straight forward computer that i purchased for the most basic of family needs  ms word  facebook  web surfing      the only thing i had to do was connect the basic attachments  monitor  keyboard and mouse   turn it on and away you go   there are 10 usb ports  a dvd read write and a nice size hard drive for what it will be used for  while i was not expecting such a large cpu tower  it does provide some room for any additional memory  drives ect  an older  refurbished  not super modern computer sometimes fits exactly what is needed  any more would be a waste  the shipping was super fast  it arrived a week early 
    i had and run windows 10 it was a good deal and worked out great
