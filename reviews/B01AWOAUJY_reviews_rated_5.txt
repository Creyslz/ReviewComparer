exactly as advertised  fully functional for great price 
exactly what i was told that i would get  was it the greatest computer ever built  no  was it an very very good computer for a very very low price  yes  yes it was  i got it as a christmas present for my mom  i fits all of her computer needs  streams video just fine  smooth and quiet functioning  nothing bad  wifi  wireless printing  noisiness  slow boot up and command response time were my worries  not problems on any of those fronts  it is a more than adequate computer for someone who isn t gaming their way through the internet or doing 100 000 things at once  it works properly and came with everything that it was supposed at an extremely reasonable price  and that is what i wanted  enough said 
very fast basic computer  at great price 
bought this to replace a 9 year old dell that was running windows vista  so it was time  i hesitated to get only a core 2 duo  since there are other faster ones  but after reading some of the reviews  and knowing that i only need to do basic web surfing  facebook  word processing  spreadsheets and emails  i thought  how bad can it be for  103   i am so pleased with it  took it out of the box  read the  read this first  sheet inside the box  hooked it up and turned it on  registered the windows 10 software and was up and running in about 20 minutes  this computer is screaming fast compared to the old one and i haven t had a single problem with it  blair technologies seems like a great seller and i had very fast shipping  i highly recommend this computer 
excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group    
excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group to deal with  they will answer any questions and help with any issues  the win 10 installed works flawlessly and the computer looks essentially new  i like that it is not a tower but has a small footprint that allows it to be laid flat on the table  it has foot pads to allow that  the cd dvd drive will work better in that horizontal layout  you can put small items on the top of it since there are no air vents on the top or bottom  i have my modem and router sitting there  while it will work wirelessly  i prefer the easy ethernet wired hookup and use the wireless for my printer  a laptop  tablet  tv  chromebook  etc  with the ethernet connection i get high speeds in spite of the heavy use of the wireless for all those other uses   easy to install and the connections are obvious  no mike or camera but those with a usb connection are very inexpensive and work just fine  good product  excellent price and good support  what s not to like for a little over  100  
an awesome product that was exactly what was needed
this is a very simple  straight forward computer that i purchased for the most basic of family needs  ms word  facebook  web surfing      the only thing i had to do was connect the basic attachments  monitor  keyboard and mouse   turn it on and away you go   there are 10 usb ports  a dvd read write and a nice size hard drive for what it will be used for  while i was not expecting such a large cpu tower  it does provide some room for any additional memory  drives ect  an older  refurbished  not super modern computer sometimes fits exactly what is needed  any more would be a waste  the shipping was super fast  it arrived a week early

great computer at a good value 
i liked it so much  i bought another one for home use 
wow  am i impressed  i bought this refurbished little gem to replace my 2012 dell desktop that finally crapped out after one to many windows 10 updates  it was under  150  came when promised and booted right up  i loved it so much in fact  that i bought another for a my sister who needed a home computer for her daughter 
best of its class    
came with extras and had more storage than expected  smooth  smelled so good that i opened the case and smelled everything  no dust  looks like it came from the factory  well packaged  highly recommend  also comes with keyboard in mouse  doesnt say in description but it does  no bluetooth tho     but it is wireless which is good  personally best of its class

  he was very humorous and easy to talk to
i was tentative about the purchase of this computer  it did only last a month prior to the hard drive going out  however  the seller company was so responsive to my problem  he tried to walk me thru troubleshooting  no small task on his end to teach this technologically stunted girl how to work on a hard drive problem   he was very humorous and easy to talk to  and when he decided that the hard drive was  toast   he immediately sent me a new and better one  he was willing to help me again  but i decided to take it to the geek squad  i have geek squad protection  so it was no cost to me   now the computer is working wonderfully 
a great all around computer

easy set up
i ve has this for a month now and it s working great  i bought this for my husband who just needed a basic computer for e mails  some occasional word documents and surfing the internet  this was more than sufficient for his needs  i was pleasantly surprised that it came with the keyboard and mouse  they also provided an external wi fi antenna so we could connect wirelessly to our network and printer  set up was super easy and quick  just follow the instructions provided  i actually expected the set up to be a lot more cumbersome and time consuming so was also pleasantly surprised by the easy set up  all in all  a good buy and good value for the my husbands needs

easy hookup  power cord missung so i used okd one but pretty simple and ckeared off desk space  quiet drive and fast    i ve had it for 4 days now and unless it breaks i m happy for the price   it s relatively fast   i don t like the keyboard or mouse but i don t know if i m just not used to it or i don t like it  easily and cheaply replaced    it did not come with power cord but my old one worked   i d like them to send me one if they could as it was advertised with one
ideal plex server
that s all it does and it does it very well  had a little trouble adding in a second internal hdd under the dvd drive but it worked  needed power cable splitter and an additional data cable  also had to go into bios and activate the additional sata port on the motherboard  other than that it is ready right out of the box  keep in mind this is not a high end machine but it has an excellent track record for reliability  i highly recommend you create a bootable system recovery usb drive immediately after it s done with everything in initial setup  the operating system is pre installed

perfect 
an excellent basic tower 
this machine is not for gamers or folks running very high demand processes  i wanted it primarily to play downloaded movies on the big flat screen i have in my sitting area  internet surf and access my huge calibre library of ebooks  it arrived well packaged  clean and ready to go  setup took virtually no time at all and the motor is very quiet  i can t hear it from 6 feet away  wireless is via a dongle rather than built in as other reviewers have noted  but it locked right in the first time and worked like a champ  no hdmi but vga is excellent  as of this writing  i literally cannot think of one negative thing to say about this  i got it for just under  100 and it s absolutely worth the price 
good computer  great price 
it is very basic and works great  i added my own keyboard and mouse and hit the ground running  i signed into my microsoft account and the computer configured appropriately  there was a price drop after i made the purchased  i am still very satisfied with the price i paid and the quality of the product  i have not used the cd rom drive  if i have issues with it  i ll update my review  for now  all is well

works great and i have not had any issues with it 
blair technology can be trusted 
best money i have spent on a pc since            like forever  worked as promised right out of the box and not a glitch to be found  found my router and modem as soon as it was turned on   no need for setup and win10 is much better than i was told it would be  nice job blair

fantastic computer
i needed a good  sturdy  fast  inexpensive spare computer to have on hand for backup and in case my primary one crashed  got this  and what a pleasant surprise  this machine runs as fast and as well as my primary 2 9 ghz dell  even though it s way older  it was easy to set up  easy to register the windows 10  and the wireless adapter works very well  i am thrilled with this purchase  and recommend getting one like this from blair to anyone  excellent customer service  easy setup instructions  they know what they re doing  couldn t be better 
what a deal 
i was greatly impressed with this computer for  100  from the time i opened the box  i was set up and on the internet within 15 minutes  i am new to windows 10 so that is taking a little bit to get used to  i use this computer for the sole purpose of making music  the program i run is gigantic in size  approx  20 gb  yet only took about an hour to download  the processor is not the fastest  however what do you expect for a  100 computer  if your expectations are realistic and don t do a great deal of gaming or video streaming  you will love this gem of a deal  the best part of this buy is that other reviewers stated that the wi fi was an external antennae  i don t know if i got lucky  but the cpu i got has an internal antennae 
great pc
the computer is just as described and works great  i had a dell precision 370 that this optiplex replaced  the optiplex actually came with 250g hd vs 80 which was advertised so thats a plus  the pc and windows 10 has worked great right out of the box which was very well packed   gonna upgrade ram to 8g and a 1t hd and be set 
good computer for what i needed it for

have not received this yet  but i was happy with ye olde xp and used it beyond the support cancellation   one day it could not be restored   then i bought the azulle fanless small model   and it would not take my ibm m30 keyboard  with that ps2 adaptor   tried to buy another m30  but none as as good as that keyboard   have designed machines with that keyboard   it s special to me such that i bought this computer in hopes that it does not make chicken soup of the alphabet like the azulle did   i never heard of those guys    set the clock  and come back and the time is different  fanless   leave it on all the time  but had no disc drive   this one i can re install autocad and sink my teeth into an engineering project again   am so looking forward to including this computer into my daily life   am overjoyed
