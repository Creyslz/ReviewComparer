let me down
these seemed to be solid  awesome headphones but as of today they mysteriously stopped being able to charge and prematurely died on me at work after showing half battery life 10 min prior  had high hopes for these headphones as my job is very physical  hands on  up to 12 hour shifts but very disappointed now  shows no red light indicating charging with multiple chargers on different outlets 
two failures 
i purchased two of these on aug 18  2017  one failed in approximately 90 days and one in 110 days  both outside the amazon return window  requested help  or at least sympathy  lol  from the shipper and received none  i do recognize that the shipper does not warrant the product  however  they normally have a better rapport with the manufacturer they represent  the units worked great until they both failed to pair with any of several devices they had been pairing with  this is the first negative review i can remember giving 
small and are not very loud 
ive worn these twice now on a few travels and overall they are garbage  1  after wearing for over an hour my ears start hurting from the headphones  my ears are not big or anything but the pressure on my ears felt like someone was tugging on them  2  i know these are not noise canceling but i honestly could not hear hardly anything on an airplane  i sat in varies areas on a plane a few trips  i had to take them off and put my earbuds in  these will never be traveling with me again  3  not really a good way to understand when they are turned off  4  i guess my 6 year old nephew will enjoy them since they kind of look cool
