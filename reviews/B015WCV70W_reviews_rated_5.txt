great investment for a solid monitor   
excellent monitor  as you can see from the photo  i bought two of them  dual monitors are the way to go  multi tasking at it s best  since it doesn t have any audio outputs  i use bluetooth from my laptop to a jbl charge 2 bluetooth speaker 
amazing product for your wallet
wow  this product is amazing it makes my acer monitor look like crap  the color on the you tube video played on both monitors  left  acer  right  hp  it is another great product made by hp  will buy again 
works great though resolution not comparable to the laptop
13 inch macbook compared to 21 5 inch monitor  just about the right size for me  works great though resolution not comparable to the laptop
i was able to purchase 3 hp pavilion 22cwa which looks awesome if i don t mind saying 
i initially started to look for an upgrade for 2010 mac mini  so when i started looking at the prices for new computers i was horrified lol  the more i looked into it i started to realize that i wasn t getting a whole lot of bang for my buck to replace my old computer  i looked into selling my old mac to make up some of the cost of a new computer  but the selling price was not worth it and the worry of selling it to the wrong person made it a good reason to keep it  i looked into upgrading my mac  the prices of ram had dropped dramatically since i purchased it  i was able to purchase 3 hp pavilion 22cwa which looks awesome if i don t mind saying  i know eventually the mac will become obsolete one day but will have great set up for the next computer 
an monitor with outstanding value 
i was looking for a dual monitor setup for my new pc setup  and i had an old acer monitor which had a resolution i wasn t happy with  i decided to search for a good monitor for a price i could have a budget for  yet enjoy  i found this excellent ips monitor  this monitor arrived in a clean box  and had instructions provided to properly setup the monitor  with a clean sheet applied to the screen to prevent light damage to the screen in shipment  upon opening  i noticed it came with a complimentary vga cable  didn t use it  since i prefer hdmi   the monitor has two parts  a stand and the monitor itself  this was easy to set up as well  and the sheet covering the monitor depicted the connections to build it clearly  after setting the monitor up  settings were easy to navigate and configure  and in seconds i was logging into windows with a clear  crisp resolution which was much more pleasing to look at than my older acer  which has light bleed and some funkier older pixels and colors  my monitor was clear of dead pixels  and was overall just as i needed for anything from browsing to gaming at a comfortable 80fps  i am in the process of purchasing another monitor to replace my older acer  thank you 
stunning display not to be a 4k
so far i love it  screen is just right for my limited space  a 1080p monitor with hdmi and ips is a steal at  100  its that simple people  see my pics 
highly recommend
wonderful price and a great product  this is a high quality sleek design monitor with near perfect pixel color  highly recommend 
beautiful monitor and outstanding value 
i am ecstatic about this purchase for several reasons  i haven t had a new monitor at home for several years  and they have come a long way since my last  15 inch  square  lcd samsung  i m not knocking the samsung monitor  it was great when new  but now it s just rather old  tired and dull  i did quite a lot of research before buying  my employer reimburses up to  75 for a home monitor to use for days when we work from home  so i wanted to come as close as possible to that price  i also wanted to step up in size to a maximum of 22 inches  to fit into the monitor recess of my bureau   additionally  i had hoped to get an led rather than lcd monitor  for inputs  i wanted vga to use with my old desktop which doesn t have hdmi  plus hdmi to use with my work laptop  since i hadn t been in the market for a monitor for a long time  i wasn t sure if i was asking too much  well  i whittled the many possible choices i found down to this hp and an asus with nearly identical specs  the asus was priced  10 higher  but offered a  10 mail in rebate  well  i hate mail in rebates  and i couldn t see me actually getting around to mailing it in and waiting 8 weeks for a  10 check that i would then have to take in to the bank to deposit  so i chose the hp   and  boy was i glad i did  i am so happy with this monitor  first of all  it fit perfectly in the space that was waiting for it  thanks to accurate measurements given in the product details in amazon com  for setup  i thought i would be in for the usual new computer equipment nightmares where nothing works at first  then you have to jump through hoops  download drivers  reboot umpteen times  go back to the manual to find out what you did wrong  find out that the manual is only on disc but now you can t read it because your new monitor isn t working yet  yadayadayada    but no  setup was a breeze  i was done in about 15 minutes  the monitor worked first time on both my old desktop with vga and new laptop with hdmi  there was one slight glitch that the initial picture was stretched sideways on the vga connection to my old desktop  but after i installed the software from the supplied disc it worked fine  the picture via the hdmi connection from the new laptop worked perfectly first time  with no need to install anything  as for switching between vga and hdmi  you just press a button on the underside of the frame  the picture is great  for my needs  at least  bright and crisp  with no evident lag when running videos  as another reviewer put it perfectly   is this a stunning  perfect display  no  not really  but it is perfect as a low cost secondary display for a laptop    i totally agree with that  my needs are average  i just only use it for work and for an occasional change from my personal laptop to look at a bigger screen to watch a video or something  i mentioned the accuracy of the stated product dimensions earlier  well  there was one thing that confused me a bit  at the top left on the amazon com page the bottom image is a silhouette of a person standing at a desk with the monitor in front of him  there is a vertical measurement shown there of 20 in 49 cm  i assumed this to be the height with the stand  thinking that the height in the technical details was without the stand   i thought this would be a problem  as i only had about 19 in vertical height where i wanted to site it  well  when it arrived  there was no problem  as the assembled unit with the stand is  in fact  15 8 in  not 20 in  so i m not sure what that 20 in in the silhouetted man picture represents  this monitor is an outstanding value and i have no hesitation in recommending it 
great 
amazing picture  i use the monitor for my ps4 and xbox 1 
more hours less fatigue 
better than advertised  it came in 2 days  i did not pay for extra fast shipping   it was very simple to set up and fits on my hanging wall desk just perfectly  the size if great  big enough to set up two sets of tabs for my work and still read all the numbers side by side  i stare at a screen for hours at a time and this one has me much less fatigued than the one it replaced  i would buy it again 
great quality  great price   
crisp and vibrant display  really fits the budget and delivers better than expected quality  colors are clear and precise  watching videos is a lot more enjoyable with this monitor  especially videos of the 60fps type   i bought one of these monitors for my main computer and it was so good  i bought a second one for a computer in my shop  i plan to buy a third one here soon for a dual display on my shop computer  hp did a good job with this monitor  installation of the stand is a breeze and you can t mess it up as the mounting spokes are made to fit only one size of the monitor so there is no guessing  just plug and play  ports on the back are 1 power supply  included  1 vga cable connection and 1 hdmi   note  only a vga cable comes with the package  hdmi will have to be purchased separately  other than that  great purchase  will definitely buy more of these bad boys 
love them  i bought another after having one for    
love them  i bought another after having one for a month  cheapest and best quality that i could find  love that it was also prime
the best monitor for almsot anything  
i guarantee 90  of these negative reviews are results of user error  every component of this monitor is flawless  i haven t had a single problem and ive had it for almost a year now  an i ve been using it with 2 different computers  it s very fast  the color is ridiculously vibrant  it s very clear and sharp  and this monitor actually looks very nice  it s ultra thin  and has a very nice and sturdy stand  in my opinion  monitors with big  bulky stands just stick out like a sore thumb  for all you gamers  if you re budget is tight  this monitor still works well  i used it for gaming for a while and while it was crystal clear  this monitor is only 60hz  so it wasn t as fast as i had hoped  if you have a higher budget  i d advise looking elsewhere  anyone who is into editing  designing or any other computer related job  i would totally recommend this display  i m an editor  and i use premiere  anyone who uses premiere would know that there are like 4 different work spaces on the screen itself  this monitor displays them all perfectly  also  it s almost completely borderless  watching youtube videos on it  for example  is great because it fills up the entire screen  who wouldn t want that  like i said before  if you re looking for a great monitor  but have a low budget  you should stop searching  because you have just found it 
if i had known realized how excellent an hdmi picture is on a computer monitor
i acquired this monitor as i was tired of moving documents around on only one computer screen  it was getting crowded and difficult to see which document i was working on at one time  after removing the monitor our of the box and putting it together  stand and monitor   i discovered that the monitor tilts front to back  forgot about that from product description   then connected both monitors to my computer  the hdmi picture quality to this monitor was outstanding  if i had known realized how excellent an hdmi picture is on a computer monitor  i would of purchased two of them and got rid of my current samsung monitor altogether  it is not an hdmi monitor and i am spoiled   the only problem i had with the monitor  as stated the picture was outstanding  colors are excellent   was figuring out how to set up win 10 with dual monitors  looking back it was funny trying to figure out which setting to use and how the mouse moves from one monitor to the other  once that was figured out i highly recommend this monitor to anyone  especially dual monitors   it s an excellent monitor for the price  i did purchase the extended protection plan  or whatever its called on amazon  only because no matter what electronic device i but  as i tell everyone   technology is only perfect in the movies   in real life   protection plans are the way to go  the monitor is excellent with my hp computer that i also purchased at amazon  but still have not done a review  amazon  please be patient  
i hate it when she uses my office since i have    
my wife decided she wanted her own little office space for her work computer for the rare days she works from home  i hate it when she uses my office since i have to disconnect the monitors from the main system and reroute to her laptop  so  i got her a desk for upstairs and a docking station  i already had a spare 21 5 inch monitor  but she wanted two monitors like she has at work  i found this product to be very affordable  i was able to hook it up quickly and i was amazed at the picture quality  i did not care for the placement of the input ports for the hdmi cables  they are right in the middle of the back of the monitor  this means the cable goes straight in making it hard to push flat against the wall or hand on a wall mount without the additional purchase of a 90 degree adapter  for the money  this product is well worth the purchase if you do not need to hang it or have it flat against a wall 
this monitor is better than the 4 3 type monitors
this monitor is better than the 4 3 monitors  square monitors    the display quality is more hd than the traditional monitors i used to own  with the price you cannot go wrong  i could of paid more for one of these monitors  it has vga  but vga should be obsolete  i have to get a display port adapter and a dvi to hdmi adapter cable to get my true hd display back and be ready for watching blu ray movies  the monitor i used to have was acting weird  and it was from another company  it was making me very board  i had to buy this one  because it s a hp  and it s very compatible with my sff desktop pc 
nice compact  high resolution monitor
i got this as a second monitor  either to use as a dual monitor for my desktop computer and or as an external monitor for my laptop  since it accepts both hdmi and vga inputs  it makes it ideal for this  you can t have both connected at the same time   the screen is slightly smaller than what i would have preferred  but it has a nice compact footprint  a great picture and 1920x1080 resolution  for the price  this can t be beat 
super monitor   looks great
this hp 21 5  led hdmi monitor is just plain outstanding     with resolution of 1920 x 1080 it gives you a crisp and beautiful screen    the only issue is   it does not have   speakers   and i missed that when i ordered it  but  for the price you can not go wrong  i just connected a single speaker to my hp tower and i now have sound  i especially like the hdmi connected and vga connection  they both located directly on the back of the monitor and your cable plugs straight in  no more having to tip the monitor over     
great value
what a great monitor for the price  it s not an apple monitor but it definitely beats my old dell monitor by a long shot  i read some mixed reviews about whether this is suitable for a mac mini  i can vouch for this and say it works great with mine  no glitches  screen turns on effortlessly  and goes to screen saver sleep mode as scheduled  pictures in raw look amazing and the screen size is perfect  as for cleaning  i get a cloroxx wipe and let it air dry for no streaks  all in all  i have no complaints and this does the job  love it 
a nice everyday monitor that won t bust your budget
very nice product  i wanted just one for my new raspberry pi adventure  but i bungled the order and received three units  the image was so good on the r pi that i used one of the extras to replace my wife s elderly monitor and returned only one   the refund procedure was painless and quick and i could just drop off the return unit at a local staples with the full refund credited to my amazon account the same day   the monitor runs on either hdmi or vga and the selection is automatic  the menu controls are basic but entirely adequate  the color is not quite as good as a tv but is just fine for streaming movies  etc  all in all  a nice monitor if you don t go in for eye popping graphics with games  i m just sorry that i couldn t think of an excuse for keeping the other extra one 
love it 
i ordered the smallest monitor size  21 5 inch   for  100  i wasn t expecting much  but this monitor exceeded my expectations  the quality was great  the stand was sturdy  and the bezel is very thin  the buttons on the underside of the monitor are discreet and work perfectly  this monitor works great with my setup and i m extremely happy with it  although i wish i could afford the larger version  
best easy on the eyes monitor  great for surveillance too 
got to admit  i had my doubts but awesome monitor  easy on the eyes like they say  make sure you do all the colors and calibration  absolutely must use install with this monitor  otherwise default drivers off center a little    with the install  you will love the control you have on this backlit monitor  this was my first so called back lit monitor  i had no idea    however  what i found it s like this  did you ever have poor lighting like i do with no overhead lights in your house and you eyes hurt a bit  well i do and i have to put the lights stand up ones all over the place to get best view  well  with the backlit  you get it from behind as well  hurts less on the eyes  i think i got it and i think hp has something here  not sure they have this on touch monitors  i have those i bought for  400 and more and they are nice but this is easy on the eyes  don t be fooled by the cheap price  it s high quality  really is 
a really good monitor
the monitor arrived with excellent protective packing that is worth keeping for future moves  in vga mode it synced to my 1280 x 800 laptop screen automatically although it is not listed as preset  clone display mode and extended display mode make working the pc a pleasure in hdmi i am using it as an entertainment center in a small room combined it with a viewtv at 263 ota converter  rabbit ears  a 64gb cruzer flash drive for dvr recording and extended cable connected headphones  1080i tv program display is crystal clear as well as recordings  great monitor and very well built with a good solid base stand  at  160 for the whole set up this was a bargain
fantastic and bright
this is pretty large compared to my laptop screen that i am used to  was easy to plug in and use  looks fantastic  matte finish which helps for sunlight  but thus far  it appears to look amazing even in full sunlight  really spectacular monitor for the price 
hp 22  ftw
a good modern pc monitor at a good price  i chose this model for several reasons   full hd resolution  non touch screen  meaning it will stay clean   16 9 widescreen aspect ratio  the black color  i dont care for white silver electronics   perfect size for my deskspace  ips  its reasonable sub 100  tag  led backlighting  energy star certified  and of course the hdmi port   that was a must have feature for me  as my pc also sports hdmi  this replaced a 20  lcd monitor  vga  i have had since 2007  what a great monitor this is  this is my first hp monitor and i must say i am impressed  i was surprised at how much lighter it is in comparison to my old monitor  setup was easy just a few minutes  the hd picture quality of this using hdmi is so clear  i also dig the attractive slim  screen fronted  bezel design and thin side profile  glad it doesnt have some light bleeding issues like i ve read some other monitors have  that would be unacceptable to me as i do also watch movies on it in a dark room  no dead or stuck pixels thankfully  a big thx to hp for putting a way to turn off the very bright power button in the settings  it does suck that hp includes an  outdated  vga cable and not an hdmi  don t be so cheap hp  spend the additional 20 cents for bulk hdmis  sure you can spend more    and go bigger  albeit w no resolution increase   however for the price you can t go wrong w the 22  i would recommend it  5 stars baby  thx also to amazon for the free fast shipping
i really like this monitor
i really like this monitor  assembly was simple and easy  i like the fact that the power supply is not enclosed in to the monitor body  that allows the monitor to run cool and makes it easier to move it around  there are certain things that look much better on a photograph then they are in a real life  this monitor is not one of them  it is every bit as elegant as the best photo  i was a bit concerned that the stand may be flimsy but it is absolutely adequate and a very beautiful at the same time  this is my first monitor using an hdmi cable and i was really pleasantly surprised how easy it was to connect  if there is any room for criticism  it is regarding the manual  i am using win 10 and at one point you are advised to go to hp support page and check for the newest software  when you get there  if you are not very careful  you may miss the warning that if you are using win 10 and install the newest software version  you may use some functionality   i did not bother to explore it further but kept the drivers that came on the cd  the colours are very nice and crisp and if you have a limited space available  this monitor is hard to beat  
cad monitor for the road
this screen is amazing for what it is and what it does for me  cad work demands lots of pixels  preferably in 1920x1080  i have a rather large 40 inch tv monitor that does this format  however  i needed something i could take on the road and set up on a hotel room desk for days at a time  confirmed  this 21 5 inch  diagonal  did fit into my 25 inch  height  semi soft luggage along with a tower and keyboard  for car travel not airline checked  it could also squeeze into my smaller 22 inch luggage  for say airline overhead  but this plan lacks protection in the corners and would also force me into a smaller  lighter cpu box  still doable but requires effort and risk  around home this smaller  than my 40 inch  monitor allows me to tuck a second cad station into a small back corner desk  of course it now sits closer than the 40  requiring me to don mild reading glasses 
tv to pc this works
so far so good with this monitor my job requires me to use their computer but my peripherals  i would have to switch the vga cables everytime i logged in and it was a wiry mess with this one all i have to do is turn off one device and the monitor goes to the other plug source  perfect for what i needed  decent price too  i did watch a 4k youtube video to test it and when it wasn t lagging  from my video card  it was stunning going to hook up the roku and see if it will play in 4k there being it has an hdmi i imagine it will double as a tv too but it s primary use will be pc
happy with it  good purchase for the price 
i work for a company that gives us laptops but makes us buy our own monitors if we want them  i sometimes work on graphics and am quite used to having a 2 monitor setup  i could have gone with a larger one  but as i had to buy my own for work  this fit the bill on price as i have to also leave it sitting on my desk at work and didn t want a huge investment  i ve been using for several months and it works fine  this is not the highest resolution you can get  which could be a factor if you re doing detailed design work  but it ok for my purposes as i don t have make graphics all the time 
gimme more  i want more 
i m amazed at the world we live in today  i remember paying hundreds of dollars  even ignoring inflation  for lesser tech in the 80s and 90s  and now for a mere  100  you can get such a wonderful product  this thing is bright  well made  and is smart looking  when it s off  i can barely make out the screen from the frame  it s fairly simple  just a vga or hdmi port on the back  and you can select between the inputs easily enough through the hidden buttons on the bottom edge next to the power button  there appears to be a glare deadening layer of plastic applied to the screen which diffuses lights really well  even when pointing a bright smartphone flashlight at the screen from about 18  away  it s noticeable  but not distracting  from about 3 feet away  i can t even see much but a faint reflection  left and right viewing is awesome  can t hardly see any difference  up and down  grayness sets in after a point  but completely reasonable viewing  you have to work at making the image look bad  the settings are plentiful  you can even turn the power led off if you don t want it on or turn on a sleep timer  i m really thinking i need another one of these  if not a handful of them  excellent price for hp quality 
great product for a great price 
great looking display for the price and a nice size  i originally saw some great reviews for this product so that is what prompted me to choose this monitor  especially after seeing the reasonable price  i later saw some iffy reviews about the monitor stopped working just after getting it  so i started to get nervous as i was waiting for it to arrive i was nervous because i did have a bad experience with an hp laptop in the past that did not last and questioned hp s reliability  i have only had this monitor for 3 months now  but i haven t had any problems with it so far  i bought it as a second display for a laptop and the colors are very vibrant and have a sharp display  i was looking for a monitor that was adjustable and had all of the ports that i needed  this one did just that  the matte screen also keeps my monitor from collecting visible fingerprints  the monitor was pretty easy to set up  as an it specialist  i would highly recommend this product even if you are not on a budget 
with so many great reviews and a great
with so many great reviews and a great  i did not hesitate to make this purchase  i was not disappointed  it is a fantastic display  for those 4k nerds and gamers who bought it and were disappointed  what were you expecting  i am reasonably certain that this is one of the best overall values on amazon  i bought it to use with my new chrome book  i ll be reviewing that too  but i want more time with it first  one clarification  one of the comparison charts indicates that it comes with an hdmi cable  it comes with a vga cable only  it s pretty simple  it is an awesome monitor for those that do not need high end specifications  i love it 
magnificent monitor
i am loving this monitor  it was easy to assemble  it produces sharp  clear images and the wide vs square design allows for easy viewing without having to scroll side to side to view an application like i use for work  i have glaucoma and my eyes get tired and my vision blurs after hours is computer use  you can adjust this monitor to make it easier on your eyes  there is nothing about it that i don t like  updated  april 9 2018 this is my second order for this monitor  i loved it the first time and when my old computer died  i ordered another of these to go with my new hp tower 
hp pavilion 21 5 inch ips led hdmi vga with vesa mounting plate
got it today  it is a good monitor  i purchased the black one  the white one is better  and its contrast ratio is 10m  the black one is 8m  i also purchased the vesa mounting plate from hp store  the part number is cvb100 vesa  it is only  17 99   tax with free shipping  not sure if amazon allows me to post the url       
amazing price quality  and a fresher model than most screens for sale with similar specs  glad i bought it 
the brightness  colors  and quality are fantastic  i love the minimalist shape and form of it  i also love the amazon price as this monitor appears to go for way more on other websites or places like ebay  i even ordered one for my mother who runs a home business and does a lot of work on her computer  i m not a monitor expert however there was one reason i chose this monitor  most other monitors i was looking at on amazon have existed for a couple of years already and this one was one of the freshest models  since usually things get better with time due to innovation i figured this would be my best choice  i m not a fan of lots of extremely dumb design decisions by hp in the past since i repair their computers on and off for a living  but i m very pleased with this monitor  i use it with my lenovo x230 thinkpad as an extention to my laptop  also i m not a color or photography expert or anything but i do like the fact that the black is consistent on it  i don t see any weird fades or things that i ve seen customers point out in reviews of other similarly priced specked models 
just what i needed 
the model i purchased was the 22cwa  21 5 inch  it does  not  come with a way to wall mount  but that s alright  i don t need that where i have mine installed  the primary reason i purchased this monitor was that it was inexpensive  was a decent size and it could take either vga or hdmi input  i will use it with my primary computer for the most part  but will also be using it with some raspberry pi computers that i fiddle with  after adjusting the display settings on my computer and auto adjusting the new display  everything looks awesome  i m pleased with this display and would buy another just like this  or even larger next time 
okay so this product for its price is great  it may not be the best monitor with    
okay so this product for its price is great  it may not be the best monitor with any fancy technology in it  but when you are on a budget and just want a decent monitor that doesn t look like its from the 90s or early 2000s  this is definitely a good go to product  when i got the monitor i ran the ufo test and it shows that it runs on a steady 60 hz refresh rate  i also ran the dead pixel test  showing that this monitor have no dead pixels  the monitor doesn t really seem to need any calibration out of the box  if you are an overclocker  the monitor overclocks pretty good as well  the monitor can run on 78 hz stable  at least mine can   but will show out of range notification  i had to down clock to 76 hz to get rid of the notification  considering most monitors doesn t overclock more than 1 to 5 hz  being able to overclock 16 hz on this monitor is a pretty big deal 
beautiful ips monitor for an unbeatable price
beautiful ips monitor for an unbeatable price  it was such a good deal i had to buy two so i can finally dual monitor at home and i m glad i did  these look great and have awesome color reproduction  i even found a feature in the osd that lets you turn off the monitors power button light  that was my only complaint as it was a little too bright and a tiny bit distracting but not anymore  also if you need to attach it to a vesa mount i bought brackets for  12 piece that work perfect from amazon so i wouldn t hold that against the monitor  especially for an ips this low 
no speakers but overall a great monitor that will get the job done
great quality picture and the perfect size for my desk  i use it mainly to play xbox and watch my streaming apps  it is a lot better than my old set up and really ties my whole room together  the monitor only offers 1 hdmi port and 1 vga port  so keep that in mind when planning your setup  also  this monitor has no built in speakers so you will need to find a way to output the sound  i kind of expected it for the price of this monitor  luckily  my headset for my xbox outputs the game and video sounds when i play or watch  i am planning on getting a hdmi audio splitter to hook up my xbox to my speakers in my room  if you can deal with the lack of speakers it is an amazing value for what you get for it  i d recommend 
for year and half  october 2016 till today april 2018  and it s still like the first day
after exactly year and half ago i purchased this hp pavilion monitor for my surveillance cameras so i can see everything anytime  honestly this monitor never turned off except few times when my power goes off so it s on 24 hr for year and half  october 2016 till today april 2018  and it s still like the first day  picture and colors are very nice and clear  no issue what so ever  i have hook up my pc on too  so it s very easy to switch from cameras to pc with only one touch  overall    very     very happy with this monitor after whole year and half   13 148 73 hours   547 86375 days  running non stop 24 7 it s still like new  highly recommend it to everyone
this is a winner
if you are looking for a 21  1920x1080 hdmi vga input display to use in  landscape  mode  this one is for you    physical design is great  not conspicuous  hp logo is discrete  so is the stand    screen quality is top notch  again as long as what you are looking for 1920x1080    price is right   90 as of my writing this review  there really is nothing wrong with it as far as i can tell it may not necessarily work for you if you are looking for ultra high definition  fancy display orientation   wall mount  more options than vga or hdmi to connect
great product  i have been using this as soon    
great product  i have been using this as soon as i took it out of the box  i connected it to one of my dvr s from time warner and i have it in a corner of my kitchen counter  i use it as a tv monitor to watch games and catch up on some of my favorite sitcoms when i am cooking or preparing food  i also have the vga cable readily available and connected to the back of the monitor already in case i wish to use it for a second screen when working on my laptop but i have not used this for that yet  it does not come with built in speakers so i have to connect external speakers to it  product still gets 5 stars because the picture is sharp and performs as described in product description  i probably use this product more than any of the other monitors i have around the house 
i ve been using it for around a month now     
i ve been using it for around a month now  i have to say the picture quality is outstanding   the flat design and the 1 5cm depth of the screen  adding to that the minimalistic design kinda looking as apple monitors    the picture quaity is really a navtive 1080p resolution  it you want it for gaming the highest hz you can get are 60hz  the ips screen has also a low light reflection if you want to place it close to a window or looking right in front to it then it won t be a really bother  the monitor stand is glossy surface and you have a  power on  led light option that you can turn on or off if you want to  and you can also incline lean it up and down so you can position the heigh or direction you want the screen 
good budget monitor
much better than i expected  for  88  this did the trick for my much needed monitor replacement  which was purchased in late 2009  this is definitely made for budgets  as it seems some corners were cut  it has a somewhat cheap feel and look to it  no hdmi cable  yes  i know it made it clear only a vga was included   the screen area is a lot bigger than i thought it would be when i took it out of the box  otherwise  the image is clear and bright  which is what i needed  no frills  nothing fancy  nothing spectacular  if that is what you need  this is not for you 
great monitor  great price 
i really like this monitor  the screen surface is not reflective  i use the monitor with an hp chromebox and a regular pc type usb keyboard  i use the hdmi connection  the 22cwa has buttons to press which allows me to set the brightness of the display way lower than the initial setting from the chromebox which was way too bright  worked right out of the box with no hassle  it is also relatively lightweight  i would recommend this monitor  pressing the appropriate keys on the keyboard did not adjust the brightness  so being able to make the adjustment at the monitor is a big plus for me  the images are clean and sharp 
excellent buy
i needed a replacement monitor  but i was skeptical of ordering this one because of the cheaper cost  i am glad that i read the positive reviews from amazon subscribers who purchased this item  i found it easy to setup and the screen resolution is excellent  i am glad that i made this purchase 
great hdmi monitor for the money
this is a good price for the quality involved  it s surprisingly hard to find a monitor that accepts hdmi at a low price point  i m happy  as are many other people i see from the reviews  i wanted to say one thing to help people in the future  i was using this as an extra monitor for my macbook pro and the hdmi setting was giving me flickering problems  individual pixels would be flickering different colors but i could get the overall gist of what was being displayed  i couldn t find anything online  i was messing around with the settings and turning off the ddc ci support fixed it  so  i hope someone else that is using this with their mac finds that disabling ddc ci fixed the problem for me  i don t even know what it does  tl dr  yeah  i wish it had a vesa mount or whatever they re called  but oh well  have a nice day 
fantastic 
hands down the best monitor i ve purchased in a long time  as a former it manager  i ve bought a lot of monitors  the value was unmatched  and the quality is amazing  its not  oh its great for the price  its really a great monitor that i honestly thought i had to have paid more for  i bought this to use with a mac mini  which incidentally  fits perfect on the stand for an  all in one  feel  the display viewing experience is good from just about any angle and it really is glare free  i kind of wish i had bought it for me and not my kid  definitely recommend  the size is great for an average user  the price is fantastic  and the quality is better than i m used to from hp 
the best monitor i ve ever owned
i am beyond pleased with this monitor  i am a bit of a monitor snob   that is to say  i get spoiled at work with myriad monitors and other fun electronics  so  after looking around and seeing some reviews  i decided to go with the hp pavillion  i will say  before it arrived  i was nervous  had i made a good purchase  the price is what scared me the most   no way that something good could be priced so cheaply  when it arrived  and even before plugging it in  i know i had made the right choice  it is a solid piece of workmanship  from the beveled back to the gorgeous flat  front of the monitor  i was so pleased  and i hadn t even plugged it in yet  upon plugging it in  i was absolutely happy with my purchase  the colors are vibrant  the blacks and true blacks  and the whites are true white  no lingering blue tint   there is also a very easy to use control panel under the power button that includes very intuitive tweaking of the four or so profiles they offer you to use  i have had this monitor for nearly six months now and it is still going on strong  i do believe i will be buying another one to set up a dual monitor work space  i d give this monitor more stars if i could  with the gorgeous image it projects  along with the incredible price point  i consider this to be the top of the tier for those looking for similar monitors from other manufacturers 
works great with my old win8 laptop
works great with my old win8 laptop  and with my win10 desktop    so good  that i m going to replace my 3 year old toshiba 37  display with a slightly scaled up bigger brother to this display  displays are so important   it is what we have to look at most of the day    and i want the best possible  for a reasonable cost   and these hp pavilion ips led backlit displays fit the bill 
it looks amazing  it really is full hd
this monitor works well  sometimes it flickers  but im not sure if thats a problem with the monitor or the computer  it looks amazing  it really is full hd  i highly recommend getting this monitor and a evga gforce gtx1050 ti graphics card  your computer will run great with this combo 
excellent choice in monitors
i do editorial work with a lot of detail  so the screen on our small laptop was very inadequate  the hp pavilion 22cwa works very well for me   great detail and resolution  it was easy to set up  and i like the streamlined shape  this makes my job much easier  so i m very pleased  i recommend this monitor 
affordable and reliable monitor  from a designer s pov 
i m a designer and frantically needed a bigger monitor to connect my macbook to  i wanted to get a decently sized and affordable monitor that wouldn t cost me an arm and a leg like a thunderbolt would  right around  100  this monitor had great reviews  even had a review from a fellow designer  and had same day shipping  i bit the bullet not expecting much  when it arrived  i was really impressed by how easy it was to set up   look me about 10 minutes total from opening the boxes to taking off all the plastic to get this baby up and running  remember to purchase an hdmi to hdmi cord if you re a fellow mac user so that you can actually use this guy  or get a vga to thunderbolt adapter and you ll be golden  this monitor comes with a vga to vga cord  you ve been warned   this is a fantastic product for a designer or anyone who just needs a bigger monitor  normally i m very wary of hp products  like laptops because they all are miserable machines  but this doesn t fall into the group of things you must steer clear of 
superb value monitor that may require a little tinkering to get the best results
this monitor displays stellar image quality at 21 5  which is  in my opinion  the optimal size for a 1080p computer monitor working at a distance of 2 feet or less  the high pixel density makes text  images  and videos crisper  when i received the monitor  i was worried about the orange glow  thankfully  there are a ton of settings  when you do buy this monitor i recommend immediately switching to  multimedia  color preset even if you do plan on primarily using the monitor for work like i do  my only other minor complaint is the bright power indicator which can be extremely bright and distracting for my ocd mind  this can be easily fixed with a small piece of electric tape  i love the slim bezel and the design is sleek and pleasing to the eye  the power cable is long enough to reach the wall  it comes with a vga cable  but i recommend using hdmi connection if your computer supports it  it doesn t come with a hdmi cord  but you can easily get one for a few bucks 
buy it 
absolute steal for the price  exactly what i was looking for 
excellent monitor at an incredible price
i bought myself a new acer aspire desktop  intel core i5 6400  8gb ddr4  2tb hdd  windows 10 home  atc 780 amzi5 and needed a nice new monitor to go with it  this hp pavilion monitor seemed to get rave reviews  so i ordered one and i couldn t be happier  perfect size and incredible picture  and extremely easy to set up  you can t go wrong with this one  highly recommended 
great quality
i was a little unsure about buying this monitor simply because of the price  but i m so glad i did  i purchased this to connect to my laptop so there could be a little more space on my desk  the clarity of the screen is great  especially for the price  there are several adjustments that can be made for brightness  contrast  and it even comes with an option for a blue light filter  i absolutely love the large display and wish i would be have found this sooner 
good value  works well as a second display 
no complaints considering the price i paid for it  using it with my macbook pro to work remotely  also used it as a display for a surveillance system because the cheap  hd  tv in my second home doesn t support 1080p  nice thin bezel  reasonably bright with good contrast  no provisions for a vesa mount and the external power brick is a bit on the huge side but overall very pleased for a below  100 monitor
