decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell 
hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok 
not delivered as advertised
not as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine 
weird happening 
gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it 
came with 7 instead of 10
3 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number 
i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam 
great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks
