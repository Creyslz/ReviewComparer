disappointed
this is the fourth shelf i have purchased from this company  i absolutely love my other 3  however  this one was of far worse quality than the first 3  in my previous orders  the shelves looked the same all the way around  on this one  one side is completely unfinished   see pictures  also  the black tubes had so many shavings inside them  just opening the package made a mess  and a quick shake of each tube left an even bigger mess   see picture  all in all  the shelves didn t go together as well or as easily as my first 3  again  i am 100  satisfied with those 3  but i m disappointed that they would allow this one to be shipped out in the shape that it s in 
arrived damaged  chips and cracks 
the package arrived in great condition but the surprise was when i opened it  3 of the 4 shelf boards had their corners chipped off and cracked  i decided to ignore it thinking what more could i have expected at this price  the problem started when i tried putting it together as the plastic rods refuse to tighten as the shelf holes which apparently should fit snug had cracks as i mentioned above  i hope they send me a replacement or refund what i paid 
caution read this before buying 
right out of the box the toxic smell of this thing triggered me to have a major asthma attack  buyer beware  toxic overseas plastic and laminate shelving 
tubes break during assembly
i bought one of these to make a cheap shelf for a few things that desperately needed it  about a quarter of the tubes  connectors broke into the other tubes after a couple of turns when they were being cautiously and delicately assembled  i didn t even get a chance to screw them tight  even if i was lucky and all of the tubes fully connected without breaking  i d worry that putting any pressure on the shelves would make them snap  i regret my purchase whole heartedly
deceptive listing  only holds 15 lbs according to the instructions  not 25  came scuffed and with a chip on it 
deceptive listing  says here it supports 25 lbs  the instructions in the manual say it only supports 15 lbs  also came with scuff marks and a chip  which exposed light tan wood making it noticeable  i suspected before that most of these positive reviews are fake  now i m convinced of that  i only bought this because of the price  so i wasn t expecting anything great  but the 1 star is for the deceptive claim that it holds 25 lbs  also what motivated this review  
damaged 
every single piece damaged  absolutely ridiculous 
not  user friendly 
packaged arrived ok but it was extremely difficult to put together  the amount of force required to twist the rods into place is crazy hard  i ve purchased products with this same twist to assemble concept but this one was by far the hardest to put together  also the finish is not that great  the white rods look very plasticky  but i guess you get what you pay for  i would not buy again or recommend to anyone 
do not buy       garbage    
you get what you pay for  three out of the 4 shelves have swells and one has a nick as well  tried to call the company 3 times and can t get through  the rods are made out of thin plastic and the shelves are 3 8  pressboard with a vinyl top  save yourself time and aggravation spend a little more money and buy from a different manufacturer  still using it because the box was thrown out before i can inspect the components  lucky if it will hold 10 lbs per shelf
