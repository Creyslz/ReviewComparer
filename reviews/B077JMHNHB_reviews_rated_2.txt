don t waste your time 
i was originally very happy with my headphones  they had a quality sound with clarity  i ve only had them for a month  and there s a short in the cord  the sound fades in and out  they only give you a month for returns  and i ve had them for a month and a week  i m very disappointed  and feel that i ve wasted my hard earned money  i will definitely not order from vogek again 
poor sound 
i don t understand how everyone can say these sound so great  even for a  15 00 pear of headphones  i have cheaper pears that sound way better  i find them to sound muffled not clear like the description reads  very disappointed with these phones 
i love how these feel
i love how these feel  felt like premium headphones but didnt last as long as a snow cone  within 3 months one of the ear pieces stopped working and by month 4 totally went bum  and i was not a heavy user either used the headphones like one day weekly give and take 
i can live with the poor quality 
the right speaker cuts in and out  i just wanted these to use when surfing the web on my laptop  i can live with the poor quality 
two stars
nice set but only one side was working
