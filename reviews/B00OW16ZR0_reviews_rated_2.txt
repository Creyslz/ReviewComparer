stalled at 6 speed  motor is not powerful 
the motor on this blender is horrible   i tried using it saturday february 9th 2018 and it stalled on both the low and high settings at the 6 speed  the blades wouldn t even spin  it s not worth the cost 
dis satisified customer
i tried to blend soft cream cheese and it would go alittle bit and quit  it never did blend it  also there are ridges on the inside of the glass which make it very difficult to scrape things out and to clean  also the glass if very heavy like lead glass  do not recommend this product 
i am very disappointed in that it does not ever crush ice
so although the price is right  and not much is to be expected  i am very disappointed in that it does not ever crush ice  i use it for smoothies and it is able to handle frozen fruit  but the ice never breaks down  also very loud 
good deal but   
doesn t chop very well
the kid is flimsy and the markings on the blender    
the lid is very flimsy and the markings on the blender are all in another language  french maybe  it does the job but i would steer clear if you can find a better option 
two stars
it doesn t do a very good job with 4 cup smoothies  leaves whole blueberries and ice cubes
o ring broken in a month 
worked fine until today when the o ring got caught and started heavily smoking  we ve had this less than a month and cant use it due to the o ring 
not enough blending power  will cause hearing damage 
it is loud enough to cause hearing damage when just blending a shake mix  it does not have enough power to get through ice or frozen fruits quickly  unit gets warm just making a protein shake with ice
