hard to beat it at this price 
solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs 
great for the price
ordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   
great machine  well worth the price 
nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output 
quality computing at a reasonable price 
i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment 
great computer after bad ram fixed 
it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots 
windows 10 system at a good price
i ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems 
remember   not a new machine
item is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever 
    product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  new
while the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great 
it s nice to get a little more room at the work    
it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too 
nice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different system
this is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy 
this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet 
this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall 
old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 
note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine 
add ssd for os  programs  and booting
product arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat 
good no frills system
good no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set 
great 
i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence 
great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    
great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card 
disappointed
originally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazon
a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    
i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain 
good system for the money
good system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would
