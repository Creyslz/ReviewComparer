nice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different system
this is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy 
good basic computer
good basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is 
hard to beat it at this price 
solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs 
great for the price
ordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   
great machine  well worth the price 
nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output 
quality computing at a reasonable price 
i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment 
great computer after bad ram fixed 
it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots 
windows 10 system at a good price
i ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems 
remember   not a new machine
item is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever 
    product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  new
while the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great 
bios   power supply
great packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished 
not sure you can go wrong   
its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating 
it s nice to get a little more room at the work    
it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too 
this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet 
this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall 
old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 
note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine 
add ssd for os  programs  and booting
product arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat 
good no frills system
good no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set 
make sure you activate windows 10
when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine 
great 
i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence 
great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    
great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card 
disappointed
originally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazon
a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    
i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain 
good system for the money
good system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would 
power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly 
the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer 
easily powers my home media center for kodi
decent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios 
a nice inexpensive quad core computer
got this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do 
solid  fast pc    bum tech support
the computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased 
for the price it was a good purchase for us
works as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us 
good starter computer that can be upgraded 
this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive 
nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great price
i bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine 
its pretty good 
its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it 
looks like it had never been used
packaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again 
this computer is great for the money
this computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance 
worth the money even though it was a refurbish 
i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase 
it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    
it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is 
good value
nice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc 
after that there were no issues and functions great since 
some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since 
great machine very competent for multitasking

four stars
great pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc 
missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is great
it is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description 
no hdmi
works great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmi
good seller  unfortunately defective product
seemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt 
good
works well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen 
woyld buy again 
i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box 
the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise 
older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise 
nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports 
up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god 
four stars
so far so good
surprise  came a day early   
this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain 
good performance for an older computer
the hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port 
i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    
i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul 
it shuts down
everything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts down
good pc for the price

i like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it 
almost perfect   
i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work 
works great 
as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great 
watch out for win 10 registration number 
cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet

all in all pretty good for the price
all four ddr3  dimm not sodimm becareful guys  were occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price 
four stars
works like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase 
buy with confidence 
the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence 
great gaming pc for the price  medium range 
really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard
    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    
got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gone
i love this deal
i love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs 
the computer hardware is okay 
the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferences
a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine
works well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like  some not  the computer itself functions well 
everything works great with it
everything works great with it  however the fan is considerable loud  it doesn t bother me though  not for the price     im very satisfied 
runs great  good value
quick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box had zero damage 
but other than that it has been working good 
didn t have wi fi built in  also didn t have enough correct ports for my monitor  but other than that it has been working good 
so far so good  it is working great

mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    
mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size 
four stars
bought multiple units and has served us well for the most part
