nice budget item but don t have sky high expectations
i got two  to outfit a part time office i am opening in another city and will use a couple days per week  budget  so the budget price was a big plus  contents faulty  the boxes are advertised on the box as containing  power cord   vga cord   one box came with 2 hdmi cables and zero power cables  this isn t a deal killer  you may have too many spares already or they are  7 at an office store  the other box came with one power cord  one vga cord  and one hdmi cord  more than the box listed  mount  be aware these are very simple flat monitors on a very simple budget plastic stand   no fancy height or angle features  i put them on a paper ream to be a couple inches higher  inputs  they do have a nice triplet set of vga   dvi   hdmi input sockets  there is also a standard little audio patch plug  but if you drive it off hdmi the audio is built in to the hdmi cable  speaker  it s quite tinny to the point of being sort of unpleasant  but there is one  contrast  the contrast may not be so great   lettering on these monitors looks  gray  compared to  sharp black  on my lenovo laptop native monitor  it s usable but won t look good compared to a monitor that could easily be double or triple the investment  if you stop comparing monitors and just use this one your eyes adapt  resolution  on a lenovo x1 gen4   you have two video outputs  a standard hdmi and a minidisplayport  either offered to drive the monitor up to 1920x1080 with the lenovo recommended you choose 1600x900  also  fyi  if you have a laptop hdmi and or a laptop minidisplayport for low cost from amazon you can get the cable of choice with any other output on the far end  hdmi  displayport  dvi  vga  etc  
good monitor for the price  but the stand doesn t come off 
ordered 7 of these monitors  none had dead pixels or flaws  display is fine  the biggest issue i had with these monitors is that vertical part of the stand cannot be removed  i was very surprised to find that the horizontal base comes off and that s it  i mounted these displays on an articulating wall mount using the 100mm vesa mounting holes  as a result  the vertical piece sticks down behind and below the monitor  bottom line  if you re wanting to mount this monitor  you ll have and unattractive black  handle  sticking down 
monitors work great except the pedestal it comes on is terrible and    
monitors work great except the pedestal it comes on is terrible and cheap   so when you mount it    the pedestal doesn t come off just the base so it has a weird projection off the pedestal  i wish i could break it off 
good little vga dvi hdmi monitor ruined by a really badly designed stand  not suitable for vesa mounting 
this is a weird product  i wanted a low cost small flat screen to use on a test bench set up where we do final test on a computer based product and software  i thought it looked pretty ideal as we have vga  dvi and hdmi units to test and unlike many other low cost products this unit offered all 3 types of input  however i can t have it on a stand i need it mounted on an arm or wall mount  nowhere does it state you can t remove all of the stand easily  it is very obvious that i am not the only customer who is dissatisfied with this idiotic design as it states on page 2 of the manual in bold font 3 times the size of all other writing  we regret the mounting stand fixture cannot be removed   since we are an electronics shop  the unit didn t cost a lot and we needed it quickly and we are engineers let me tell you that you can remove the stupid stand  however you will need to split apart the monitor like a cellphone with the correct tools then remove 2 internal screws to get the thing out of there  monitor wise it works pretty good  but if you don t want it on the stand and don t have serious engineering skills then don t buy this as it looks very stupid on a standard vesa mounting with a tube sticking out the bottom which fouls the up down movement 
do not buy this monitor to wall mount   fine monitor for the price for a desktop monitor 
monitor is a good size and seems to work just fine  although  i purchased two of these monitors for wall mounting  they do have mounting brackets  but what they do not tell you is that the neck piece that connects to the base can not be removed  looks stupid with the neck piece sticking out  who would build a mountable monitor like this    fine monitor for the price if you do not want to wall mount 
it s worth the price for sure  but i would never pay more money for this product 
first off the first pic advertised is all wrong  the monitor itself looks nothing like that  the rest of the pics are correct  it s definitely smaller then what you would think and i m pretty sure it s not a 20 inch screen  the resolution is pretty good though  i bought one for my office computer and it works for what i need it for and i m about to buy another one to duel monitor  it s worth the price for sure  but i would never pay more for this product 
sceptre is a great co only and i love their products
sceptre is a great co only and i love their products  i have had great luck with 2 televisions from them and one i bought in 2011 is still running very strong  love the monitor but it came with a dead pixel  come on sceptre  not very cool  still contemplating sending it back for another maybe ill have better luck  i ordered two monitors one hp 22cwa and the sceptre as my secondary screen  i wish i would have ordered two of the hp ones  luckily ill just use the sceptre at work where the dead pixel wont bother me  disappointed but the price was good 
i don t like how the monitor cannot move on the stand
i don t like how the monitor cannot move on the stand  they almost sit tilted forward  so that it is hard to see unless the monitor is higher than you are  i would not recommend 
after a year of use  dead pixels start to    
after a year of use  dead pixels start to show  but it works as it should  i only wish that you could remove the leg that holds the monitor up  as it is not removable 
cheap price and cheap build 
they are cheap monitors and so is the price  you will see dead pixels on all of these but if you can live with a few of those its not that bad  otherwise look elsewhere and spend double for a good monitor 
only vga and power cable included
monitor is great for the price but it only comes with a vga and power cable  no audio  hdmi  or dvi cable 
three stars
was missing stand
