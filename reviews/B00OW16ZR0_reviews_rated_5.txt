great value and decent blender for the money
great value and decent blender for the money  the glass pitcher is thick and heavy duty  the lid fits so tight and sturdy it takes a little strength to remove until it  breaks in  and loosens a bit  but that sure beats a floppy or loose lid that doesn t stay put when blending  i have made several smoothies with frozen berries and ice and it works just fine  like any blender  if your mixture is too thick and icy  some liquid needs added to get it to thoroughly mix into that  whirlpool  effect from the bottom up  otherwise  you have to  pulse and spoon  the mixture down to release air pockets and get it to settle to the bottom of the picture for mixing  this is typical with any blender i have used however  and i have owned blenders from  19 to  450  i expect to get a couple years worth of smoothie and margarita mixing out of it and then buy another when the motor burns up or the gears slip  as already stated though  i am extremely pleased with the quality for the price and think it is a top value when it comes to blenders 
clean and easy
this is a simple  straightforward blender  easy to assemble  easy to clean  the capacity is great enough to make a couple of smoothies no problem  and i seem to not make such a mess with this blender as i have some others  simple design allows for simple maintenance 
recommended   
wow    this is an awesome blender and the fact that the blender jar is glass makes for super easy clean up   you won t be disappointed for the price 
excellant blender

it does the job and for the price  i can not expect more    it is worth to buy  works perfectly 
i got it for my dad to mix up his    
i got it for my dad to mix up his protein shakes and things of that nature  it may not be top of the line  but for  15 or how much it cost  it sure is handy for what he uses it for 
it will blend 
top seal is a flexible material and has a nice multi ring  so when i am blending liquids they don t squirt out the top edges  as happens on many of the lower end blenders 
love
