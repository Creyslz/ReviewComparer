best for the price  not a superstar 
for the price  i don t think this can be beat  i bought two of these  and spent about the same amount of money as if i were to buy a decent 24  monitor  they re a little small  but not bad from a foot or so away  the number of inputs is awesome  but i would prefer 2 hdmi over 1 hdmi  vga  and dvi  today s devices primarily use hdmi  the speakers are  eh  not impressive  at least they re there  unlike a lot of monitors  but the volume is limited and the quality is poor  don t buy this for the speaker  my biggest complaint is that neck that goes into the base is not  easily  removable  so  if you plan to mount this on a wall or stand  like me  then you ll have an unsightly black neck sticking out the bottom  i ve read you can remove the monitor frame and unscrew the neck  but i tried this and wasn t able to separate the frame without feeling like i was going to break something 
its inexpensive but the neck cannot be removed
this monitor was inexpensive and works ok if youre going to set it on a desk  if you plan on using a vesa wall mount  be aware that the neck is actually attached to the monitor and cannot be removed   see my pics  this means youll have an ugly looking chunk of plastic hanging from under the monitor  i still cant decide if i want to keep it since the monitor was very inexpensive  or if its going to hurt my eyes too much to see the glaring eyesore under the monitor due to it being wall mounted with the base removed  i wish i had noticed this before purchasing because i definitely would have picked a different monitor  other than the weird neck issue  the monitor works and looks great   especially when using it with the base on a flat surface  im using the hdmi port on the back but it also has vga to connect to your pc  i played with the monitors menu and it has options to adjust a few different settings  i liked that it had warm cool normal etc  view settings  i am using it to view my security cameras so no other adjustments were needed for my situation  the built in speaker were a bonus and work fine for basic sounds tests  an fyi if you are going to wall mount it   i searched the q a before purchasing and received conflicting info on the vesa size for this unit  i purchased a  20 articulating wall mount that would work for either 75mm or 100mm spacing  after installing the mount   monitor today i noted it used the wider spaced holes so it does appear to need a 100mm vesa mount 
good value for the money  but not the equivalent of an hp or dell computer monitor
i paid  49 for this monitor  so i can t complain  but  for the benefit of readers  i will point out three things   1  it came with a vga cable  which you probably want to replace with a dvi cable  or hdmi if you don t mind setting audio every time you connect the monitor    2  the video quality is good  but not as good as what you might see on an hp or dell computer monitor   3  the height of the monitor is not adjustable 
good value  speakers are useless  leg can be removed
it is a good monitor for the money  i bought it as a second monitor so i could connect it to my dvr and watch tv while  working  at my computer  vga and hdmi inputs are a big plus  the speakers are next to useless  they face away from the user and are not loud enough  i was a bit concerned about the unremovable stand but decided not to worry about it since i was just going to set it on my desk anyway  now i have bought a dual monitor stand and decided to see if the  leg  could be removed  if nothing else i would just saw it off  what the heck it is just a  70 monitor  i removed the four screws on the back  pried off the bezel  lifted up the screen  and there were the screws that hold the leg on  i removed them and put the monitor back together the monitor looks great on the stand and i can always put the leg back on later 
perfect for pi projects
great little monitor to do raspberry pi projects with  my only complaint is where the power port and hdmi ports are located  instead of being located on the bottom of the monitor  where they could be tied together and hidden   they are located on the left and right of the components box  so your power cord and hdmi cable are hanging off the left and right of the monitor  it s just ugly is what i m saying 
nice picture but the audio is terrible
nice picture but the audio is terrible  why do they bother to insert tiny speakers that sound like tin cans  i have a 32  scerptre tv with the same tinny sounding speakers and had to buy a set of amplified speakers so we can use the tv  update  17 may 2017  this monitor lasted only 8 1 2 months now when i turn it on the screen flashes  sceptre    the unit shuts down and the blue led continuously blinks slowly  it has a 1 year warranty but too many escape clauses  update  on further investigation i disconnected the hdmi cable that was purchased with the monitor and connected a vga cable and now the monitor operates as it should  now to get my adjustments corrected  bottom line 1  problem with my hdmi cable or connection  or 2  my video card  however  when my cpu was on why didn t the screen display  no signal  if no signal was present  which it usually did see when i was shutting down the computer before shutting off the monitor  next step is to try a different hdmi cable if i have one   i changed my review to 4 stars  if it wasn t for the tiny speakers i would give 5 stars 
just what i needed for my new security system
i had got this monitor to go with my new security system  i must say that i am so far very pleased with this monitor  i had no issues setting it up with my system  the screen quality   size is perfect for what i needed  its not the highest end picture  but i knew i was getting a lower end monitor since its just for security  it has only been set up for about a week  so if anything changes in the future i will happily update my review accordingly  i used the hdmi input for connecting it up  however is does also have dvi or vga input as well  so if you need another connection option this is good  since im using this as a security monitor  im not really using the built in dual speakers  but they are a nice addition to the monitor  upon testing the speakers  i did notice the quality is not perfect  but again  for my needs this is not an issue at all  im not sure this is a true 20 monitor as it seems a touch smaller than my other 20 but to be honest  thats not a big deal for me  it actually fits perfectly where i have my system set up  i did notice that a couple people stated they did not get all the wires that were supposed to  i myself did not have this issue   i also did notice a few people that saying the monitor stopped working after a few months  so since i have only been using this for a short while  i will come back   update my review after it has been working for a few months  so  for my needs this monitor gets 5 stars  however  if youre going to be needing a monitor for something that might require a high end picture or great sound  this might not be the best option for you  so my overall rating for this will be a 4 star rating  this is only because of the picture sound if its being used for something other than a security system  as for recommending this monitor  i would have to say that if youre looking for a good   affordable item  this may be the monitor youre looking for  all in all  this is a great basic monitor  however  if you need something with high end picture   sound you may want to consider a different monitor that suits your needs a bit better sceptre e series e205w 1600 v1 20  screen led lit monitor with hdmi  dvi and vga ports
no shipping box       
it is perfect for what i used it for  my security system monitor  my old one finally burnt up and died  looked at the bb box store  they had one for  74 but of course did not have it in stock  but they did have plenty of  125 monitors available  bla      free shipping and under  70 this was a no brainier  good clear color  works like a champ  not as big as i imagined but i am not using it for a computer  as a matter of fact my only complaint was it was shipped in the original box  it was on display for all to see and it was pretty banged up  ups must have thought it was a football  thus the reason i took 1 star off                       
excellent  inexpensive monitor  positional adjustment not working on 1 of 2 monitors i ordered 
i bought two of these monitors and both have excellent colors and contrast  i deducted one star because on one of the monitors  i was not able to adjust the horizontal and vertical positioning through the monitor s menu  that option was mysteriously grayed out and i m not sure why  since only a tiny portion of the image is cut off  it wasn t worth the hassle of returning it for a replacement  that option was not grayed out on the other monitor and it was easy to make the necessary adjustments 
great small monitor with hdmi  a  image quality  worth the price point 
this is a great monitor if you are intentionally looking for something smaller and easier on your eyes  i was using a large flatscreen hdtv  however because of the distance of this large screen from my face it was like the equivelant of staring into a bright lightbulb  inducing ocular migraines regularly  this is a great purchase as it is exactly what i was looking for  simple  light weight  smaller  hdmi  and much easier on my eyes when i work  to my surprise  it does have built in speakers if you wish to use them  but i m more of a headphones guy myself  the  only  negative is that it had  one  dead pixel on arrival  thats why i gave it a 4 instead of 5  i m sure i can simply return it and get it fixed  but one dead pixel doesn t bother me to be quite honest 
sensitive to movement
the picture is wonderful however it  at least my particular monitor  seems very sensitive to movement of any kind  if i even brush up against it as i m reaching for my desk it sometimes blinks off and then on again after a few seconds  4 stars for the picture and price but would be 5 if it wasn t so sensitive 
great value
this is a great price for the monitor we bought 2 and one of them is lop sided after the base is attached  not a real big deal but my husband was annoyed  but for the price you cannot beat it 
overall i am pleased with this product
this monitor is a nice size but not the best resolution  it works great as a home computer that you don t work on for long periods  i use it as a home computer storage computer  it was mailed through usps in a large box with bubble wrap  it shipped within 5 days  overall i am pleased with this product
good enough
good piece of technology  after all  what can you expect of a  68 tv screen  i wouldn t recommend it to game  but to watch movies  and play basic games it s good  although if you want to play video games like cs go go ahead  it s not a bad experience  but as i said before  not recommended  you d rather spend  100 on a better tv screen monitor  
decent monitors
just keep in mind that the pole connecting the base to the screen does not remove  so if you are trying to mount the screens  you are stuck with the pole coming out of the bottom
i was kind of surprised when i opened the box    
i was kind of surprised when i opened the box and found an included vga cable  otoh  there wasn t an hdmi cable included    however  i have multiple  homebuilt boxes that go back a few years  and i wanted a monitor that was compatible with the various video cards in those boxes  and this monitor does the job  nothing fancy  but it was inexpensive and does exactly what i needed it to do 
the instructions for set up were easy to follow
the instructions for set up were easy to follow  the screen is great for what i needed it for  better viewing with larger view area than my laptop has   the only problem was that it did not include the proper connector for a laptop  the 2 which were included would be great for a regular pc computer but i had to purchase a separate one for connection to my laptop which was the reason for the purchase 
great except for brightness
pretty good  especially for the price  my main complaint is the brightness  turning up the brightness completely washes out the image so it s white  if you re in a room with some sunlight  it s hard to see the image at all  still worth the money  and i like it  but if you re serious about gaming look for another option 
working great  not the highest resolution which i was aware    
working great  not the highest resolution which i was aware of but still it would have been nice  hdmi dvi and vga ports on the back  clear picture but the speakers are thin sounding 
i love this monitor
i love this monitor  i was worried about the wide screen   it is clear  the speaker is ok  the size is just right  i am thinking of getting a 2nd one  not sure what graphic designers like  i never really got in to using designer products  no bracket mounts  i use it with my desktop computer so it is nice on my family table if anyone come to visit  as a woman i can lift it or move it myself 
sound quality my only down side
i live this monitor  definitely serves the purpose with great hd and color quality  i did not give 5 stars because the sound quality not so great b8t with externela desk speakers tje problem is easily solved 
good  but not great
pros  it s a very low priced product  great display  warning  some users have reported dead pixels  although i have not seen any  unless if it has 7  dead pixels it s considered to be a  new monitor   supports hdmi  vga  and vdi connections has an audio port  although i have not tested it  so i don t know the quality cons  the speakers are on the back of the monitor instead of the front
good budget monitor
got this monitor for my daughters pc  it works good and she likes it  it does the job cant ask for more for the price
good economical monitor 
was a bit smaller than expected but great color resolution 
works fine  looks like there was one bad pixel in    
works fine  looks like there was one bad pixel in it  but just using it for my raspberrypi so it works fine for what i m doing for the price
