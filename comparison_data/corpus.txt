nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applications
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever bought
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop   also kept endlessly restarting  was on the phone with amazon tech support and after multiple tries and attempts to fix it  he said the

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no electronic problems  it hangs sometimes  w  linux   could be memory issues no wifijust bought this computer as i needed windows 10 for turbo tax and find out it has no wifi  really  its 2018  what computer has no wifi  anyway  plan on spending another  40 to get a wifi adapter didn t work after installation of software this crashed after installing software two starsno wifi availability      in

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing games
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase and it came with windows 10 64 bit  running vm and ubuntu without any issue so far shipping was on time with good packing  pc worked goodshipping was on time with good packing  pc worked good quiet clean  but window 10 product key was missing  return was fast and easy  hope to buy another one with a coa all in all pretty good for the priceall four ddr3  dimm not sodimm becareful guys  were occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30

why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3

wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just right for what we had in mind perfect    a  plus cosmetic condition  100 percent accurate specs chose this unit after researching and comparing multiple units across all major sellers  including dell hp refurbished sites good this is wonderful  works great awesome so far the computer arrived on time and so far is working great  it is only a month and i haven t started putting software on it for my wah jobs but i will update this review then five starsit is a good product
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen

8300 that we have purchased recently  i remember to opt for a faster processor disappointed i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how to fix the issue all of which failed one starwouldn t load and operate right out of the box had to return it the same day i received itbetter to buy new than throw your money away here i bought this

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no

this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all

getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the

slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer

was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues  monitor is rally nice for someone who has vision issues and its adjustable worked good for 3 months then monitor went outworked good for 3 months then monitor went out  can t complain pc still works great bought a bigger monitor anyway good service  3 stars because of monitorjust a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an    just a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect bitter sweetso i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not everything the  tower  arrived but never received the screen or the keyboard mouse  for now i m satisfied with the tower and its overall performance three starsit works the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download    the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download a program straight from ea games to help me play the

don t waste your time  for a hundred or two more you will be much happier not overly happyi guess you get what you paid for  the computer is scratched up and good use for kids games but stopped working after the second week    i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yetthe computer is everything that was advertised  i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yet three starsok i guess three starsit worksvery satisfiedit is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programsit is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now

rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like  some not  the computer itself functions well everything works great with iteverything works great with it  however the fan is considerable loud  it doesn t bother me though  not for the price     im very satisfied runs great  good valuequick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box had zero damage but other than that it has been working good didn t have wi fi built in  also didn t have enough correct ports for my monitor  but other than that it has been working good so far so

packed well looks newall worked great  packed well looks new  only complaint is an excessively loud cooling fan  so much so im ordering replacement fan four starslow price and it worksfour starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol i love it and it was fairly cheap to get a nice onefour starsgreat product only on amazonfor the price we will be back   best deal on amazon   four starsall that for under  100good system for the pricebought for nephews  good system for the price four starsworks great and price was really good no manual on how to change the voltage it works well  but i used it outside the usa without knowing that it was not set to 230v and it blew up ok computergood computer the monitor sucks but if you have another one it looks perfect keyboard is cheapfour starsgood for video streaming and normal internet browsing  but it runs slower after upgrade to windows 10 four starseverything was in excellent condition and is working fine the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price processor not so fast as dual corefour starsfine supportvery nice computer it work good for what i have to    very nice computer it work good for what i have to do with it  four starsquite goodcan t beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

starsvery happy  only thing is speakers are scratchy  sound  and the stand broke early on no sound drivehad trouble installing my printer  no up dated drive  monitor is good but a older model  very heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way overall happy with itthe computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall

wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

if my opinion changes  great computer  i work mostly at home and needed a new computer and decided to go with a cheaper desktop  haven t really installed any big programs yet  will probably install office  came with windows 10  which works fine  you have to authenticate windows using key on the back of the computer  there s a sheet of paper that comes with it stating this  but i am always the person that throws that crap away  so fyi  has no hdmi but does have display port  i had to order a hdmi to display port cable  right now i have it hooked up via vga  i clearly have little knowledge in reviewing a computer but bottom line if your looking for a basic desktop i would recommend  plus reading other  more computer inclined reviewers  seems pretty good    updated still loving it  fast

as long as you re not expecting it to play everything on ultra  plays eso on low settings without a gpu  i get around 60 90fps eso with the gt730 good product for the pricefor the price you pay the

saying this is one of the best computers you can get for the money if you are looking to get into pc gaming then this is the pc this paired with the gtx 1050ti or 1050 plain makes a simple mid range gaming pc that can run fortnite at 100  fps on ultra settings and tom clancy s rainbow six siege at 60  fps on ultra settings     when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop    i m a guy on a budget so when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop but didn t want to spend on a brand new one  found these great

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once

everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter

wah jobs but i will update this review then five starsit is a good productexcellent so fararrived two and half weeks ahead of schedule  and was well packaged  within 30 minutes computer was up and running  monitor  keyboard and mouse appear to be brand new  the only thing we ve found wrong is a tiny foot missing from the bottom of the computer housing which made it rock a little bit  a tiny piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it

functioning  overall i am pleased and i will update if an issue occursgreat computer for the price works super quick and can t beat the price  bought it to replace the ten year old mac that is slow

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original

other than that oversight  it is great great for my aging eyesthis monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my own home  the windows product key didn t work when i tried entering at the initial set up  but the 2nd time that i tried it it registered correctly without any problems  not sure what the glitch was with that  but i am loving this cost effective set up so glad that i found youso glad that i found you  details written said plug in ready  i did not have to spend hours with internet tech to set up

purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can

wanted to deal with  it still had the previous owner s info  documents  pictures  ect  the usb ports were difficult to use  like they were warped  it came with an internet adapter  not the built in wireless that i wanted  i sent it back within a few days  and i am the type of person that never sends anything back or returns stuff to stores  i just knew it was not for me  i decided to not waste my money and bought a new pc that arrived today delli am u happy with my computer  it doesn t have any better features than my old one  slow as the old one
product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the

it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no

computer has no wifi  anyway  plan on spending another  40 to get a wifi adapter didn t work after installation of software this crashed after installing software two starsno wifi availability      in 2017slowthis computer is so slow it s almost unusable  it also doesn t have speakers built in tried everything to get wifi to operate on this computer    tried everything to get wifi to operate on this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all  but is in good condition  just sad once again that it wasn t the computer in the picture i seen  oh well    expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality not at all what i expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality two starsit was a 64 bit not 32 which i neededi bbought 2 of these refurbished computers for kids and    i bbought 2 of these

to replace the monitor  ugh two starswindows keeps giving a warning that software not certifieddisappointednot at all what i expected in a refurbished computer  non stop error messages  very slow  and getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried feeding it to the fishes  but they wouldn t take it eithertwo starsdidnt have monitor power plug or compatible keyboardtwo starsworks fine  find something else  trust me purchased the computer in

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues

internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect bitter sweetso i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not

thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says    so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says my window 10 key is not valid so i have to pay for it but the computer does work as it should i have had it now for almost a week and have been using it daily a couple of issues     but otherwise a good computeri ran into a couple of snaffu s with this desktop  side note   i am techno retard  so please excuse my lack of expert terminology   i have a 27  hp monitor that i wanted to use my hdmi cable for optimal picture viewing  but this desktop does not come with an hdmi port   no kidding  look at the pictures   you can use your old school vga monitor cable  but if your monitor supports hdmi  don t expect to have hdmi functionality right of the bat  i did some research and to solve this issue  i bought a displayport to hdmi adapter and connected it to the tiny  unlabeled  illuminated d p port on the back of the computer  my monitor now supports hdmi quality picture  https   www amazon com gp product b017q8zvwk ref oh aui detailpage o03 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 another issue i encountered was slow internet speeds  my desktop came with a 802 11n wireless chip adapter already plugged into one of the back usb ports  i ran an online speed test and wasn t picking up more than 2 mbps  very slow  to solve this issue  i connected an ethernet cable directly to my modem from my desktop and am now picking up 35  mbps  i know this stuff may seem obvious as you re reading it  but it took me a while to figure this stuff out on my own without any help from dell  finally  one other thing  the video graphics card is pretty sub par  i tried playing guild wars 2 and it s incredibly slow choppy   to be fair  there are reviews on here stating this is not a gaming computer  just had to find out the hard way  i guess   actually  if you re reading this  is it possible to upgrade the graphics card in this desktop to make it gaming compatible   one other thing  don t get confused with  it comes pre installed with windows 10   if you re like me  perhaps you thought it would come pre installed with microsoft office  but it does not  i guess i really need to brush up on my computer lingo     overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player    overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player because it was broken internally  after replacing it seems to work ok  the casing was a little beat up but  that s what you get for refurbished three starsgenerally like dell  ended up buying a dell computer  but this tower just did not work out for meon the fence about performancejust got everything setup and wanted to write a review  packaging was good  pc worked right out the box but since plugging it in  i ve noticed several issues 1  it s not quiet  i keep hearing a clicking noise 2  moves very slow  even before i attempted to download any software 3  screen blacks out and shuts entire internet session down  i ve never purchased a certified refurbished pc but so far not good  i love that is comes with windows though good bang for your buckgood bang for your buck  daughter can t play minecraft bc of integrated gpu  case isn t standard size limited upgradeability   great web browser three starsa bit slower than i expected fast response  other concerns my dell optiplex   it s a great little machine i loved it    great to play very fast response on clicking actions  but  for some odd reason it glitched on me  so now when i attempt to power it on  it doesn t turn on  only the  3 4  numbers light up on the front the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever hadwindows 10 is all new to me  hard for me to adjust and learn  the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had  i need to follow up to find out why the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have    the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have updated everything and i done all of the troubleshooting and it still randomly reboots  i have no idea why not bad okay so far  two things that future buyers need to be aware of  one  the pc i received did not work with wifi nor could i set it up  had to use a direct ethernet connection to the modem two  windows 10 was not preinstalled for upgrade from windows 7  had to download from microsoft directly  also  it is only 160 gb hard drive  but after win10 installation plus a few others i still had enough space leftover  a little  buggy  at first when trying to set up virus protection and scanning  etc  but after a few days all is working efficiently  not bad too mu8ch space used up by windows 10 too mu8ch space used up by windows 10  should have left the space open to the user not the person who gets the kick back from the advertisersgreat for it s priceit s not too bad but  it s not compatible with many things that i would like to do on it    it s lasting me long enough until i can get a new one  and it s a lot better than the one i used before this  it s a little under priced though  a  100 pc should be a lot worse than how it is now
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i

starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and

starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol

that it was not set to 230v and it blew up ok computergood computer the monitor sucks but if you have another one it looks perfect keyboard is cheapfour starsgood for video streaming and normal internet browsing  but it runs slower after upgrade to windows 10 four starseverything was in excellent condition and is working fine the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price

beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

starsvery happy  only thing is speakers are scratchy  sound  and the stand broke early on no sound drivehad trouble installing my printer  no up dated drive  monitor is good but a older model  very heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way overall happy with itthe computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall

amazing and does its job  only problem was the case had a crack in it  but its cosmetic and more than likely thanks to the delivery rather than the seller so far it works great used for a cnc machine  so far it works great     look old but so far it is working very good the case is look old but so far it is working very good  four starsruns mintgood performance for the price for more money there are certainly better systems  but for the basics  this is great  had to replace the memory after 3 months  still not a bad deal  but down to 4 stars  the machine appears and operates as if new and is very fast  my only complaint would be that it seemed plagued by a number of outdated drivers  although i had to employ a third party vendor to correct this deficiency  the cost was nominal  and overall i am very pleased with the purchase and consider it a wise investment had to purchase a new key board as my old    had to purchase a new key board as my old one had an out dated connection end  no big deal as key boards are really cheap nice computercomputer works well  i don t like windows 10 and seem to be having problems with the email app disappearing but the computer is good four starsworks great  fast and compact  nice machine for the price the computer took forever to get her but it was shipped free  i appreciate that  so far it is performing good  nice machine for the price four starsworking well so far and i been happy with it four starsso far it works fine four starsseems finefour starsso far so good everything as advertised recommended to friendsthe windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set upit is a fast running computer  the windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set up  the start up is the same as any other windows version computer  i bought mine for an excellent price around  95 and it is worth every bit of it  i have had it for two months and use it everyday to do basic computer work and some school studies  it is wifi compatible but they send an antenna with it to pick up the wifi service and the wifi does not work on this device without out it  also there is no bluetooth  so you also have to buy separately a bluetooth transmitter  the wifi antenna they sent with it stopped working with this after a week and i made dozens of calls to local computer servicing businesses and they did not know why so i spent  15 to buy a new one which was very aggravating  also the windows office products do not come with this device so you have to purchase them separately for like  99  it has numerous little bugs and fixes but just for an at home pc to do some work on it works fine  not highly recommended otherwise  my best advise is to do your research and find out exactly what you need and are looking for    don t go wrong with a machine like this cause it can just become a money drain like it has for me  fan is loud  gets hotgets really hot and fan becomes very loud  not on floor or against surfaces blocking vents  works well otherwise four starsthe sound quality is not so goodfour starsperhaps it is my internet connection  but sometimes slow
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks great for the investment  was clean on the inside and out and ran flawlessly from first boot  perfect network machine for small home office better than advertisedthe computer and accessories were all present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter

piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

wanted   www jw org  great computer  great company in blair technologygreat computer  great company in blair technology very good for the pricevery good machine for the money  over all this was a good purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

 quiet  simply perfect   impressive  a much better  stronger and faster computer than i expected  just plug and play    it came loaded with windows 10   a substantial investment to buy windows   also  with a backup disk  a usb wireless adapter  not a built in wireless card   and the power cord  it s whisper quiet and ready to rumble    refurbished is as good as new for me  and at a fraction of the cost of a new one   came from linkedpc  inc     i did need to login and register with microsoft  then i downloaded my favorite programs and installed  btw the dvd cd tray works fantastic    my 10 year old dell inspiron bit the dust  i had to have a desktop to replace her  shopping around i accidentally stumbled across this  wow  i scored    it is fast  i am not an online gamer  but  i do use facebook  a lot   have thousands of pictures  watch many youtubes  and play online casino games  ect  there has not even been a hiccup in anything i try to run  seamless    update 10 01 2017  still behaving perfectly  running smooth and fast    i only recommend the very best products and this computer is by far one of them    if you want a good back lit keyboard  with large font  here s the one i bought  imbaprice large font print usb led backlit keyboard  orange and blue  imba lob bkb    if you have any questions  feel free to click my username and send email  i will answer you    hope you found this review useful  thanks exactly as advertised  fully functional for great price exactly what i was told that i would get  was it the greatest computer ever built  no  was it an very very good computer for a very very low price  yes  yes it was  i got it as a christmas present for my mom  i fits all of her computer needs  streams video just fine  smooth and quiet functioning  nothing bad  wifi  wireless printing  noisiness  slow boot up and command response time were my worries  not problems on any of those fronts  it is a more than adequate computer for someone who isn t gaming their way through the internet or doing 100 000 things at once  it works properly and came with everything that it was supposed at an extremely reasonable price  and that is what i wanted  enough said very fast basic computer  at great price bought this to replace a 9 year old dell that was running windows vista  so it was time  i hesitated to get only a core 2 duo  since there are other faster ones  but after reading some of the reviews  and knowing that i only need to do basic web surfing  facebook  word processing  spreadsheets and emails  i thought  how bad can it be for  103   i am so pleased with it  took it out of the box  read the  read this first  sheet inside the box  hooked it up and turned it on  registered the windows 10 software and was up and running in about 20 minutes  this computer is screaming fast compared to the old one and i haven t had a single problem with it  blair technologies seems like a great seller and i had very fast shipping  i highly recommend this computer excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group    excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group to deal with  they will answer any questions and help with any issues  the win 10 installed works flawlessly and the computer looks essentially new  i like that it is not a tower but has a small footprint that allows it to be laid flat on the table  it has foot pads to allow that  the cd dvd drive will work better in that horizontal layout  you can put small items on the top of it since there are no air vents on the top or bottom  i have my modem and router sitting there  while it will work wirelessly  i prefer the easy ethernet wired hookup and use the wireless for my printer  a laptop  tablet  tv  chromebook  etc  with the ethernet connection i get high speeds in spite of the heavy use of the wireless for all those other uses   easy to install and the connections are obvious  no mike or camera but those with a usb connection are very inexpensive and work just fine  good product  excellent price and good support  what s not to like for a little over  100  an awesome product that was exactly what was neededthis is a very simple  straight forward computer that i purchased for the most basic of family needs  ms word  facebook  web surfing      the only thing i had to do was connect the basic attachments  monitor  keyboard and mouse   turn it on and away you go   there are 10 usb ports  a dvd read write and a nice size hard drive for what it will be used for  while i was not expecting such a large cpu tower  it does provide some room for any additional memory  drives ect  an older  refurbished  not super modern computer sometimes fits exactly what is needed  any more would be a waste  the shipping was super fast  it arrived a week early five starsgreat computer at a good value i liked it so much  i bought another one for home use wow  am i impressed  i bought this refurbished little gem to replace my 2012 dell

immediately sent me a new and better one  he was willing to help me again  but i decided to take it to the geek squad  i have geek squad protection  so it was no cost to me   now the computer is

more than sufficient for his needs  i was pleasantly surprised that it came with the keyboard and mouse  they also provided an external wi fi antenna so we could connect wirelessly to our network and printer  set up was super easy and quick  just follow the instructions provided  i actually expected the set up to be a lot more cumbersome and time consuming so was also pleasantly surprised by the easy set up  all in all  a good buy and good value for the my husbands needs more than i expectedarrived quickly and as described more than i expected was includedfive starsexcellentfive

like it  easily and cheaply replaced    it did not come with power cord but my old one worked   i d like them to send me one if they could as it was advertised with oneideal plex serverthat s all it does and it does it very well  had a little trouble adding in a second internal hdd under the dvd drive but it worked  needed power cable splitter and an additional data cable  also had to go into bios and activate the additional sata port on the motherboard  other than that it is ready right out of the box  keep in mind this is not a high end machine but it has an excellent track record for reliability  i highly recommend you create a bootable system recovery usb drive immediately after it s done with everything in initial setup  the operating system is pre installed five starsworks

seller again in a heartbeat five starseasy to installfive starsgreat product   good choice and good priceit works greatfive starsperfect an excellent basic tower this machine is not for gamers or folks running very high demand processes  i wanted it primarily to play downloaded movies on the big flat screen i have in my sitting area  internet surf and access my huge calibre library of ebooks  it arrived well packaged  clean and ready to go  setup took virtually no time at all and the motor is very quiet  i can t hear it from 6 feet away  wireless is via a dongle rather than built in as other reviewers have noted  but it locked right in the first time and worked like a champ  no hdmi but vga is excellent  as of this writing  i literally cannot think of one negative thing to say about this  i got it for just under  100 and it s absolutely worth the price good computer  great price it is very basic and works great  i added my own keyboard and mouse and hit the ground running  i signed into my microsoft account and the computer configured appropriately  there was a price drop after i made the purchased  i am still very satisfied with the price i paid and the quality of the product  i have not used the cd rom drive  if i have issues with it  i ll update my review  for now  all is well five starsworks great and i have not had any issues with it blair technology can be

for its price i m very happy with my dell optiplex 780 desktop intel core 2    i m very happy with my dell optiplex 780 desktop intel core 2 duo 2 9ghz    from blair technology group  it s as good as new      five starsthe tower is nice lot smaller than my sony more room on deskfantastic computeri needed a good  sturdy  fast  inexpensive spare computer to have on hand for backup and in case my primary one crashed  got this  and what a pleasant surprise  this machine runs as fast and as well as my primary 2 9 ghz dell  even though it s way older  it was easy to set up  easy to register the windows 10  and the wireless adapter works very well  i am thrilled with this purchase  and recommend getting one like this from blair to anyone  excellent customer service  easy setup instructions  they know what they re doing  couldn t be better what a deal i was greatly impressed with this computer for  100  from the time i opened the box  i was set up and on the internet within 15 minutes  i am new to windows 10 so that is taking a little bit to get used to  i use this computer for the sole purpose of making music  the program i run is gigantic in size  approx  20 gb  yet only took about an hour to download  the processor is not the fastest  however what do you expect for a  100 computer  if your expectations are realistic and don t do a great deal of gaming or video streaming  you will love this gem of a deal  the best part of this buy is that other reviewers stated that the wi fi was an external antennae  i don t know if i got lucky  but the cpu i got has an internal antennae great pcthe computer is just as described and works great  i had a dell precision 370 that this optiplex replaced  the optiplex actually came with 250g hd vs 80 which was advertised so thats a plus  the pc and windows 10 has worked great right out of the box which was very well packed   gonna upgrade ram to 8g and a 1t hd and be set good computer for what i needed it for good computer for what i needed it for  i have it set up as a video encoding machine running plex for the house  i just leave it on all the time and load all my movies through it  so far after 2 months it is running good best

not received this yet  but i was happy with ye olde xp and used it beyond the support cancellation   one day it could not be restored   then i bought the azulle fanless small model   and it would not take my ibm m30 keyboard  with that ps2 adaptor   tried to buy another m30  but none as as good as that keyboard   have designed machines with that keyboard   it s special to me such that i bought this computer in hopes that it does not make chicken soup of the alphabet like the azulle did   i never heard of those guys    set the clock  and come back and the time is different  fanless   leave it on all the time  but had no disc drive   this one i can re install autocad and sink my teeth into an engineering project again   am so looking forward to including this computer into my daily life   am overjoyed great deal great deal five starsa ok




nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applications
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever bought
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping out  i will never buy refurbished computers again buyer bewarereceived this computer 30 days agao and it worked for 2 weeks then went dead  buyer beware arrived in timely manner   was able to access

three discs   just grinds  will not trust another refurbished system  arrived damaged   it arrived poorly packaged and damaged both visibly  and in such a way that i could not open the case to install my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen

8300 that we have purchased recently  i remember to opt for a faster processor disappointed i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how to fix the issue all of which failed one starwouldn t load and operate right out of the box had to return it the same day i received itbetter to buy new than throw your money away here i bought this

months  i demand a refund  i was ripped off will go to best buy or some place and buy new from now    doesn t work  don t ever buy a refurbished hp  lesson learned  will go to best buy or some place and buy new from now on you know they could let you know that it didnt come with everything so you would know so you could get it beforehand thats so rude and stupid it really pisses me offokay every time i buy something refurbished it doesnt work right or not work at all in the first place it didnt come with wifi you needed a cord i paid a tech to come out and set it up twice because he had to get the right cords and wifi it worked when he was here my wife turned it on this my all it had was a blue screen so i called amazon they tried to fix it and couldnt so i called hp support they said i had the wrong number so then i called the seller they didnt answer wanted me to leave a message you have to understand we are into 2 hours now and nothing so im sending this piece of crap back  im telling you dont buywe went out and purchased an adapter from best buy for  39we were very surprised to see that the computer did not come with a wireless adapter  we went out and purchased an adapter from best buy for  39  but this was very inconvenient  suggest this  lack of a  feature be more clearly stated   as it has left this particular customer dissatisfied  in today s day and age   this is

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no

computer has no wifi  anyway  plan on spending another  40 to get a wifi adapter didn t work after installation of software this crashed after installing software two starsno wifi availability      in

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing games
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like  some not  the computer itself functions well everything works great with iteverything works great with it  however the fan is considerable loud  it doesn t bother me though  not for the price     im very satisfied runs great  good valuequick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box had zero damage but other than that it has been working good didn t have wi fi built in  also didn t have enough correct ports for my monitor  but other than that it has been working good so far so

were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most part
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks great for the investment  was clean on the inside and out and ran flawlessly from first boot  perfect network machine for small home office better than advertisedthe computer and accessories were all present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

person that throws that crap away  so fyi  has no hdmi but does have display port  i had to order a hdmi to display port cable  right now i have it hooked up via vga  i clearly have little knowledge

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just right for what we had in mind perfect    a  plus cosmetic condition  100 percent accurate specs chose this unit after researching and comparing multiple units across all major sellers  including dell hp refurbished sites good this is wonderful  works great awesome so far the computer arrived on time and so far is working great  it is only a month and i haven t started putting software on it for my wah jobs but i will update this review then five starsit is a good product
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

all timeone stargave me the wrong product key
product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even

need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues  monitor is rally nice for someone who has vision issues and its adjustable worked good for 3 months then monitor went outworked good for 3 months then monitor went out  can t complain pc still works great bought a bigger monitor anyway good service  3 stars because of monitorjust a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an    just a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect bitter sweetso i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not everything the  tower  arrived but never received the screen or the keyboard mouse  for now i m satisfied with the tower and its overall performance three starsit works the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download    the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download a program straight from ea games to help me play the

don t waste your time  for a hundred or two more you will be much happier not overly happyi guess you get what you paid for  the computer is scratched up and good use for kids games but stopped working after the second week    i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yetthe computer is everything that was advertised  i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yet three starsok i guess three starsit worksvery satisfiedit is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programsit is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase and it came with windows 10 64 bit  running vm and ubuntu without any issue so far shipping was on time with good packing  pc worked goodshipping was on time with good packing  pc worked good quiet

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like  some not  the computer itself functions well everything works great with iteverything works great with it  however the fan is considerable loud  it doesn t bother me though  not for the price     im very satisfied runs great  good valuequick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box had zero damage but other than that it has been working good didn t have wi fi built in  also didn t have enough correct ports for my monitor  but other than that it has been working good so far so

starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol

a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price

beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great

heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m

wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come

fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five starsunbeatable price  packaged well  i would definately buy again five starsworked great   five starslove itfive starsfast shipping works great looks brand new five starseverything worked as

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter

running  monitor  keyboard and mouse appear to be brand new  the only thing we ve found wrong is a tiny foot missing from the bottom of the computer housing which made it rock a little bit  a tiny piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it

being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original product key  x ed out  i would have thought the computer was new  the only surprise was wifi adapter had to be purchased separately for the one i bought   i must have missed that when i ordered it  other than that oversight  it is great great for my aging eyesthis monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my own home  the windows product key didn t work when i tried entering at the initial set up  but the 2nd time that i tried it it registered correctly without any problems  not sure what the glitch was

wanted   www jw org  great computer  great company in blair technologygreat computer  great company in blair technology very good for the pricevery good machine for the money  over all this was a good purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop   also kept endlessly restarting  was on the phone with amazon tech support and after multiple tries and attempts to fix it  he said the

8300 that we have purchased recently  i remember to opt for a faster processor disappointed i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how to fix the issue all of which failed one starwouldn t load and operate right out of the box had to return it the same day i received itbetter to buy new than throw your money away here i bought this

me back i have not talked to any one yet   after this unit froze up on me 2 or 3 times and the videos card must have been bad because the screen would jump down when trying to use it  so i just now thru it out the door with the rest of the trash  this one i bought from blair and the other one i bought for a friend was not from blair  so now i have to buy another and it want be from blair  just now installed it  works good faster than my old one  it was cheaper to buy this computer with windows 10 on it than to update to my older computer to windows 10  i just want to buy more memory sticks to max out the memory it has 2 more slots just can found the right type  don t want to buy wrong kind any help on this  i will update review later one starslowone starpissed  won t even play minecraft story mode game  the only reason i bought this one staritem did not work at allnot recommendeddishonest description and defective product i got what i paid for   shorts on both the psu and the motherboard causes it to randomly power on or off sent it back i am a cheapskate and have bought many used computers over the years  i knew as soon as i took it out of the box that it was not what i wanted to deal with  it still had the previous owner s info  documents  pictures  ect  the usb ports were difficult to use  like they were warped  it came with an internet adapter  not the built in wireless that i wanted  i sent it back within a few days  and i am the type of person that never sends anything back or returns stuff to stores  i just knew it was not for me  i decided to not waste my money and bought a new pc that arrived today delli am u happy with my computer  it doesn t have any better features than my old one  slow as the old one
product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even

this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all  but is in good condition  just sad once again that it wasn t the computer in the picture i seen  oh well    expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality not at all what i

getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power

slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer

then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues  monitor is rally nice for someone who has vision issues and its adjustable worked good for 3 months then monitor went outworked good for 3 months then monitor went out  can t complain pc still works great bought a bigger monitor anyway good service  3 stars because of monitorjust a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an    just a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect bitter sweetso i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not everything the  tower  arrived but never received the screen or the keyboard mouse  for now i m satisfied with the tower and its overall performance three starsit works the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download    the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download a program straight from ea games to help me play the sims 2  i couldn t do it since it said there s something wrong with my server three starsgreat computer my niece and nephews love itthree starsmy kids can t even play minecraft on it the video card needs upgrading already three starsstill had some things on it  i expected everything to be erasedgood more romgood more rom pleasethree starsgood think youthree starsno dvd burnerthe dvd drive wasn t connected or working when we plugged    the dvd drive wasn t connected or working when we plugged in the computer  the drive literally was loose  leaving the slot open don t waste your timebuy new  don t waste your time  for a hundred or two more you will be much happier not overly happyi guess you get what you paid for  the computer is scratched up and good use for kids games but stopped working after the second week    i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yetthe computer is everything that was advertised  i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yet three starsok i guess three starsit worksvery satisfiedit is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programsit is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says    so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says my window 10 key is not valid so i have to pay for it but the computer does work as it should i have had it now for almost a week and have been using it daily a couple of issues     but otherwise a good computeri ran into a couple of snaffu s with this desktop  side note   i am techno retard  so please excuse my lack of expert terminology   i have a 27  hp monitor that i wanted to use my hdmi cable for optimal picture viewing  but this desktop does not come with an hdmi port   no kidding  look at the pictures   you can use your old school vga monitor cable  but if your monitor supports hdmi  don t expect to have hdmi functionality right of the bat  i did some research and to solve this issue  i bought a displayport to hdmi adapter and connected it to the tiny  unlabeled  illuminated d p port on the back of the computer  my monitor now supports hdmi quality picture  https   www amazon com gp product b017q8zvwk ref oh aui detailpage o03 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 another issue i encountered was slow internet speeds  my desktop came with a 802 11n wireless chip adapter already plugged into one of the back usb ports  i ran an online speed test and wasn t picking up more than 2 mbps  very slow  to solve this issue  i connected an ethernet cable directly to my modem from my desktop and am now picking up 35  mbps  i know this stuff may seem obvious as you re reading it  but it took me a while to figure this stuff out on my own without any help from dell  finally  one other thing  the video graphics card is pretty sub par  i tried playing guild wars 2 and it s incredibly slow choppy   to be fair  there are reviews on here stating this is not a gaming computer  just had to find out the hard way  i guess   actually  if you re reading this  is it possible to upgrade the graphics card in this desktop to make it gaming compatible   one other thing  don t get confused with  it comes pre installed with windows 10   if you re like me  perhaps you thought it would come pre installed with microsoft office  but it does not  i guess i really need to brush up on my computer lingo     overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player    overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player because it was broken internally  after replacing it seems to work ok  the casing was a little beat up but  that s what you get for refurbished three starsgenerally like dell  ended up buying a dell computer  but this tower just did not work out for meon the fence about performancejust got everything setup and wanted to write a review  packaging was good  pc worked right out the box but since plugging it in  i ve noticed several issues 1  it s not quiet  i keep hearing a clicking noise 2  moves very slow  even before i attempted to download any software 3  screen blacks out and shuts entire internet session down  i ve never purchased a certified refurbished pc but so far not good  i love that is comes with windows though good bang for your buckgood bang for your buck  daughter can t play minecraft bc of integrated gpu  case isn t standard size limited upgradeability   great web browser three starsa bit slower than i expected fast response  other concerns my dell optiplex   it s a great little machine i loved it    great to play very fast response on clicking actions  but  for some odd reason it glitched on me  so now when i attempt to power it on  it doesn t turn on  only the  3 4  numbers light up on the front the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever hadwindows 10 is all new to me  hard for me to adjust and learn  the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had  i need to follow up to find out why the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have    the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have updated everything and i done all of the troubleshooting and it still randomly reboots  i have no idea why not bad okay so far  two things that future buyers need to be aware of  one  the pc i received did not work with wifi nor could i set it up  had to use a direct ethernet connection to the modem two  windows 10 was not preinstalled for upgrade from windows 7  had to download from microsoft directly  also  it is only 160 gb hard drive  but after win10 installation plus a few others i still had enough space leftover  a little  buggy  at first when trying to set up virus protection and scanning  etc  but after a few days all is working efficiently  not bad too mu8ch space used up by windows 10 too mu8ch space used up by windows 10  should have left the space open to the user not the person who gets the kick back from the advertisersgreat for it s priceit s not too bad but  it s not compatible with many things that i would like to do on it    it s lasting me long enough until i can get a new one  and it s a lot better than the one i used before this  it s a little under priced though  a  100 pc should be a lot worse than how it is now
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase and it came with windows 10 64 bit  running vm and ubuntu without any issue so far shipping was on time with good packing  pc worked goodshipping was on time with good packing  pc worked good quiet

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like  some not  the computer itself functions well everything works great with iteverything works great with it  however the fan is considerable loud  it doesn t bother me though  not for the price     im very satisfied runs great  good valuequick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box had zero damage but other than that it has been working good didn t have wi fi built in  also didn t have enough correct ports for my monitor  but other than that it has been working good so far so

starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol i love it and it was fairly cheap to get a nice onefour starsgreat product only on amazonfor the price we will be back   best deal on amazon   four starsall that for under  100good system for the pricebought for nephews  good system for the price four starsworks great and price was really good no manual on how to change the voltage it works well  but i used it outside the usa without knowing that it was not set to 230v and it blew up ok computergood computer the monitor sucks but if you have another one it looks perfect keyboard is cheapfour starsgood for video streaming and normal internet browsing  but it runs slower after upgrade to windows 10 four starseverything was in excellent condition and is working fine the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price

beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m

are certainly better systems  but for the basics  this is great  had to replace the memory after 3 months  still not a bad deal  but down to 4 stars  the machine appears and operates as if new and is very fast  my only complaint would be that it seemed plagued by a number of outdated drivers  although i had to employ a third party vendor to correct this deficiency  the cost was nominal  and overall i am very pleased with the purchase and consider it a wise investment had to purchase a new key board as my old    had to purchase a new key board as my old one had an out dated connection end  no big deal as key boards are really cheap nice computercomputer works well  i don t like windows 10 and seem to be having problems with the email app disappearing but the computer is good four

four starsworking well so far and i been happy with it four starsso far it works fine four starsseems finefour starsso far so good everything as advertised recommended to friendsthe windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set upit is a fast running computer  the windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set up  the start up is the same as any other windows version computer  i bought mine for an excellent price around  95 and it is worth every bit of it  i have had it for two months and use it everyday to do basic computer work and some school studies  it is wifi compatible but they send an antenna with it to pick up the wifi service and the wifi does not work on this device without out it  also there is no bluetooth  so you also have to buy separately a bluetooth transmitter  the wifi antenna they sent with it stopped working with this after a week and i made dozens of calls to local computer servicing businesses and they did not know why so i spent  15 to buy a new one which was very aggravating  also the windows office products do not come with this device so you have to purchase them separately for like  99  it has numerous little bugs and fixes but just for an at home pc to do some work on it works fine  not highly recommended otherwise  my best advise is to do your research and find out exactly what you need and are looking for    don t go wrong with a machine like this cause it can just become a money drain like it has for me  fan is loud  gets hotgets really hot and fan becomes very loud  not on floor or against surfaces blocking vents  works well otherwise four starsthe sound quality is not so goodfour starsperhaps it is my internet connection  but sometimes slow
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

as long as you re not expecting it to play everything on ultra  plays eso on low settings without a gpu  i get around 60 90fps eso with the gt730 good product for the pricefor the price you pay the

saying this is one of the best computers you can get for the money if you are looking to get into pc gaming then this is the pc this paired with the gtx 1050ti or 1050 plain makes a simple mid range gaming pc that can run fortnite at 100  fps on ultra settings and tom clancy s rainbow six siege at 60  fps on ultra settings     when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop    i m a guy on a budget so when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop but didn t want to spend on a brand new one  found these great

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five starsunbeatable price  packaged well  i would definately buy again five starsworked great   five starslove itfive starsfast shipping works great looks brand new five starseverything worked as

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just

running  monitor  keyboard and mouse appear to be brand new  the only thing we ve found wrong is a tiny foot missing from the bottom of the computer housing which made it rock a little bit  a tiny piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

functioning  overall i am pleased and i will update if an issue occursgreat computer for the price works super quick and can t beat the price  bought it to replace the ten year old mac that is slow

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original product key  x ed out  i would have thought the computer was new  the only surprise was wifi adapter had to be purchased separately for the one i bought   i must have missed that when i ordered it  other than that oversight  it is great great for my aging eyesthis monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my own home  the windows product key didn t work when i tried entering at the initial set up  but the 2nd time that i tried it it registered correctly without any problems  not sure what the glitch was with that  but i am loving this cost effective set up so glad that i found youso glad that i found you  details written said plug in ready  i did not have to spend hours with internet tech to set up

was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

performance computerthe package arrived swiftly and the computer is a good performancefive starsgreat price  met all of my expectationsimpressive  comes with windows 10  wi fi  seamless  plug and play  quiet  simply perfect   impressive  a much better  stronger and faster computer than i expected  just plug and play    it came loaded with windows 10   a substantial investment to buy windows   also  with a backup disk  a usb wireless adapter  not a built in wireless card   and the power cord  it s whisper quiet and ready to rumble    refurbished is as good as new for me  and at a fraction of the cost of a new one   came from linkedpc  inc     i did need to login and register with microsoft  then i downloaded my favorite programs and installed  btw the dvd cd tray works fantastic    my 10 year old dell inspiron bit the dust  i had to have a desktop to replace her  shopping around i accidentally stumbled across this  wow  i scored    it is fast  i am not an online gamer  but  i do use facebook  a lot   have thousands of pictures  watch many youtubes  and play online casino games  ect  there has not even been a hiccup in anything i try to run  seamless    update 10 01 2017  still behaving perfectly  running smooth and fast    i only recommend the very best products and this computer is by far one of them    if you want a good back lit keyboard  with large font  here s the one i bought  imbaprice large font print usb led backlit keyboard  orange and blue  imba lob bkb    if you have any questions  feel free to click my username and send email  i will answer you    hope you found this review useful  thanks exactly as advertised  fully functional for great price exactly what i was told that i would get  was it the greatest computer ever built  no  was it an very very good computer for a very very low price  yes  yes it was  i got it as a christmas present for my mom  i fits all of her computer needs  streams video just fine  smooth and quiet functioning  nothing bad  wifi  wireless printing  noisiness  slow boot up and command response time were my worries  not problems on any of those fronts  it is a more than adequate computer for someone who isn t gaming their way through the internet or doing 100 000 things at once  it works properly and came with everything that it was supposed at an extremely reasonable price  and that is what i wanted  enough said very fast basic computer  at great price bought this to replace a 9 year old dell that was running windows vista  so it was time  i hesitated to get only a core 2 duo  since there are other faster ones  but after reading some of the reviews  and knowing that i only need to do basic web surfing  facebook  word processing  spreadsheets and emails  i thought  how bad can it be for  103   i am so pleased with it  took it out of the box  read the  read this first  sheet inside the box  hooked it up and turned it on  registered the windows 10 software and was up and running in about 20 minutes  this computer is screaming fast compared to the old one and i haven t had a single problem with it  blair technologies seems like a great seller and i had very fast shipping  i highly recommend this computer excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group    excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group to deal with  they will answer any questions and help with any issues  the win 10 installed works flawlessly and the computer looks essentially new  i like that it is not a tower but has a small footprint that allows it to be laid flat on the table  it has foot pads to allow that  the cd dvd drive will work better in that horizontal layout  you can put small items on the top of it since there are no air vents on the top or bottom  i have my modem and router sitting there  while it will work wirelessly  i prefer the easy ethernet wired hookup and use the wireless for my printer  a laptop  tablet  tv  chromebook  etc  with the ethernet connection i get high speeds in spite of the heavy use of the wireless for all those other uses   easy to install and the connections are obvious  no mike or camera but those with a usb connection are very inexpensive and work just fine  good product  excellent price and good support  what s not to like for a little over  100  an awesome product that was exactly what was neededthis is a very simple  straight forward computer that i purchased for the most basic of family needs  ms word  facebook  web surfing      the only thing i had to do was connect the basic attachments  monitor  keyboard and mouse   turn it on and away you go   there are 10 usb ports  a dvd read write and a nice size hard drive for what it will be used for  while i was not expecting such a large cpu tower  it does provide some room for any additional memory  drives ect  an older  refurbished  not super modern computer sometimes fits exactly what is needed  any more would be a waste  the shipping was super fast  it

task on his end to teach this technologically stunted girl how to work on a hard drive problem   he was very humorous and easy to talk to  and when he decided that the hard drive was  toast   he immediately sent me a new and better one  he was willing to help me again  but i decided to take it to the geek squad  i have geek squad protection  so it was no cost to me   now the computer is

folks running very high demand processes  i wanted it primarily to play downloaded movies on the big flat screen i have in my sitting area  internet surf and access my huge calibre library of ebooks  it arrived well packaged  clean and ready to go  setup took virtually no time at all and the motor is very quiet  i can t hear it from 6 feet away  wireless is via a dongle rather than built in as other reviewers have noted  but it locked right in the first time and worked like a champ  no hdmi but vga is excellent  as of this writing  i literally cannot think of one negative thing to say about this  i got it for just under  100 and it s absolutely worth the price good computer  great price it is very basic and works great  i added my own keyboard and mouse and hit the ground running  i signed into my microsoft account and the computer configured appropriately  there was a price drop after i made the purchased  i am still very satisfied with the price i paid and the quality of the

primary one crashed  got this  and what a pleasant surprise  this machine runs as fast and as well as my primary 2 9 ghz dell  even though it s way older  it was easy to set up  easy to register the windows 10  and the wireless adapter works very well  i am thrilled with this purchase  and recommend getting one like this from blair to anyone  excellent customer service  easy setup instructions  they know what they re doing  couldn t be better what a deal i was greatly impressed with this computer for  100  from the time i opened the box  i was set up and on the internet within 15 minutes  i am new to windows 10 so that is taking a little bit to get used to  i use this computer for the sole purpose of making music  the program i run is gigantic in size  approx  20 gb  yet only took about an hour to download  the processor is not the fastest  however what do you expect for a  100 computer  if your expectations are realistic and don t do a great deal of gaming or video streaming  you will love this gem of a deal  the best part of this buy is that other reviewers stated that the wi fi was an external antennae  i don t know if i got lucky  but the cpu i got has an internal antennae great pcthe computer is just as described and works great  i had a dell precision 370 that this optiplex replaced  the optiplex actually came with 250g hd vs 80 which was advertised so thats a plus  the pc and windows 10 has worked great right out of the box which was very well packed   gonna upgrade ram to 8g and a 1t hd and be set good computer for what i needed it for good computer for what i needed it for  i have it set up as a video encoding machine running plex for the house  i just leave it on all the time and load all my movies through it  so far after 2 months it is running good best

not received this yet  but i was happy with ye olde xp and used it beyond the support cancellation   one day it could not be restored   then i bought the azulle fanless small model   and it would not take my ibm m30 keyboard  with that ps2 adaptor   tried to buy another m30  but none as as good as that keyboard   have designed machines with that keyboard   it s special to me such that i bought this computer in hopes that it does not make chicken soup of the alphabet like the azulle did   i never heard of those guys    set the clock  and come back and the time is different  fanless   leave it on all the time  but had no disc drive   this one i can re install autocad and sink my teeth into an engineering project again   am so looking forward to including this computer into my daily life   am overjoyed great deal great deal five starsa ok




nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applications
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever bought
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug

not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power

being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing games
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i

and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming

deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and

were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most part
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

as long as you re not expecting it to play everything on ultra  plays eso on low settings without a gpu  i get around 60 90fps eso with the gt730 good product for the pricefor the price you pay the

saying this is one of the best computers you can get for the money if you are looking to get into pc gaming then this is the pc this paired with the gtx 1050ti or 1050 plain makes a simple mid range gaming pc that can run fortnite at 100  fps on ultra settings and tom clancy s rainbow six siege at 60  fps on ultra settings     when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop    i m a guy on a budget so when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop but didn t want to spend on a brand new one  found these great

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as

it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just right for what we had in mind perfect    a  plus cosmetic condition  100 percent accurate specs chose this unit after researching and comparing multiple units across all major sellers  including dell hp refurbished sites good this is wonderful  works great awesome so far the computer arrived on time and so far is working great  it is only a month and i haven t started putting software on it for my wah jobs but i will update this review then five starsit is a good product
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping out  i will never buy refurbished computers again buyer bewarereceived this computer 30 days agao and it worked for 2 weeks then went dead  buyer beware arrived in timely manner   was able to access

three discs   just grinds  will not trust another refurbished system  arrived damaged   it arrived poorly packaged and damaged both visibly  and in such a way that i could not open the case to install my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop   also kept endlessly restarting  was on the phone with amazon tech support and after multiple tries and attempts to fix it  he said the motherboard was no good and told me to return it disk error makes it uselesscomputer has disk error after 2 months of use and rarely turns on  not worth the hassle one starslowest version of the hp 8300 that we have purchased recently  i remember to opt for a faster processor disappointed i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how to fix the issue all of which failed one starwouldn t load and operate right out of the box had to return it the same day i received itbetter to buy new than throw your money away here i bought this

sent me are a terrible hot pink color  i knew the price was to good to be true  you get what you pay for could be betteri recived the computer speakers that came with this itemone starworst deals of all timeone stargave me the wrong product key
product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no

this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all  but is in good condition  just sad once again that it wasn t the computer in the picture i seen  oh well    expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality not at all what i expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality two starsit was a 64 bit not 32 which i neededi bbought 2 of these refurbished computers for kids and    i bbought 2 of these

getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power

slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer

to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot

1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two

stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues

computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for

the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not everything the  tower  arrived but never received the screen or the keyboard mouse  for now i m satisfied with the tower and its overall performance three starsit works the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download    the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download a program straight from ea games to help me play the sims 2  i couldn t do it since it said there s something wrong with my server three starsgreat computer my niece and nephews love itthree starsmy kids can t even play minecraft on it the video card

connected or working when we plugged    the dvd drive wasn t connected or working when we plugged in the computer  the drive literally was loose  leaving the slot open don t waste your timebuy new  don t waste your time  for a hundred or two more you will be much happier not overly happyi guess you get what you paid for  the computer is scratched up and good use for kids games but stopped working after the second week    i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yetthe computer is everything that was advertised  i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yet three starsok i guess three starsit worksvery satisfiedit is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programsit is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like

my way with windows 10 like i did 7     i am having a problem copying to a cd  i can burn to the pc but can t copy from itfour starsmy wife loves itfour starsno problemsfour starsokayall worked great  packed well looks newall worked great  packed well looks new  only complaint is an excessively loud cooling fan  so much so im ordering replacement fan four starslow price and it worksfour starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol i love it and it was fairly cheap to get a nice onefour starsgreat product only on amazonfor the price we will be back   best deal on amazon   four starsall that for under  100good system for the pricebought for nephews  good system for the price four starsworks great and price was really good no manual on how to change the voltage it works well  but i used it outside the usa without knowing that it was not set to 230v and it blew up ok computergood computer the monitor sucks but if you have another one it looks perfect keyboard is cheapfour starsgood for video streaming and normal internet browsing  but it runs slower after upgrade to windows 10 four starseverything was in excellent condition and is working fine the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price processor not so fast as dual corefour starsfine supportvery nice computer it work good for what i have to    very nice computer it work good for what i have to do with it  four starsquite goodcan t beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

everything is as advertised  i couldn t be more happier with this product  received ahead of time  it is not clear as to how to hookup the speakers and couldn t find instructions on internet

starsvery happy  only thing is speakers are scratchy  sound  and the stand broke early on no sound drivehad trouble installing my printer  no up dated drive  monitor is good but a older model  very heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way overall happy with itthe computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall happy with it  awesome computer packageawesome computer package  each part works properly and i love the product s design four starsthe system has been having driver issue dont know what that means

wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks great for the investment  was clean on the inside and out and ran flawlessly from first boot  perfect network machine for small home office better than advertisedthe computer and accessories were all present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

no noise at all  came with a new wired mouse and key board  even thou i thought it wouldn t  work well and down loaded everything i had on my old computer with no problems  very happy with this unit amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter

piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping out  i will never buy refurbished computers again buyer bewarereceived this computer 30 days agao and it worked for 2 weeks then went dead  buyer beware arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet    arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet   system locks up when two or three windows are open   constantly  re start   fristrated  cd dvd drive is  junk    ruined two or three discs   just grinds  will not trust another refurbished system  arrived damaged   it arrived poorly packaged and damaged both visibly  and in such a way that i could not open the case to install my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop   also kept endlessly restarting  was on the phone with amazon tech support and after multiple tries and attempts to fix it  he said the motherboard was no good and told me to return it disk error makes it uselesscomputer has disk error after 2 months of use and rarely turns on  not worth the hassle one starslowest version of the hp 8300 that we have purchased recently  i remember to opt for a faster processor disappointed i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how

motherboard causes it to randomly power on or off sent it back i am a cheapskate and have bought many used computers over the years  i knew as soon as i took it out of the box that it was not what i wanted to deal with  it still had the previous owner s info  documents  pictures  ect  the usb ports were difficult to use  like they were warped  it came with an internet adapter  not the built in wireless that i wanted  i sent it back within a few days  and i am the type of person that never sends anything back or returns stuff to stores  i just knew it was not for me  i decided to not waste my money and bought a new pc that arrived today delli am u happy with my computer  it doesn t have any better features than my old one  slow as the old one
product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no

this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all

getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried feeding it to the fishes  but they wouldn t take it eithertwo starsdidnt have monitor power plug or compatible keyboardtwo starsworks fine  find something else  trust me purchased the computer in

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues

internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect bitter sweetso i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not everything the  tower  arrived but never received the screen or the keyboard mouse  for now i m satisfied with the tower and its overall performance three starsit works the computer arrived on time

haven t used it yet three starsok i guess three starsit worksvery satisfiedit is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed

complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says    so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says my window 10 key is not valid so i have to pay for it but the computer does work as it should i have had it now for almost a week and have been using it daily a couple of issues     but otherwise a good computeri ran into a couple of snaffu s with this desktop  side note   i am techno retard  so please excuse my lack of expert terminology   i have a 27  hp monitor that i wanted to use my hdmi cable for optimal picture viewing  but this desktop does not come with an hdmi port   no kidding  look at the pictures   you can use your old school vga monitor cable  but if your monitor supports hdmi  don t expect to have hdmi functionality right of the bat  i did some research and to solve this issue  i bought a displayport to hdmi adapter and connected it to the tiny  unlabeled  illuminated d p port on the back of the computer  my monitor now supports hdmi quality picture  https   www amazon com gp product b017q8zvwk ref oh aui detailpage o03 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 another issue i encountered was slow internet speeds  my desktop came with a 802 11n wireless chip adapter already plugged into one of the back usb ports  i ran an online speed test and wasn t picking up more than 2 mbps  very slow  to solve this issue  i connected an ethernet cable directly to my modem from my desktop and am now picking up 35  mbps  i know this stuff may seem obvious as you re reading it  but it took me a while to figure this stuff out on my own without any help from dell  finally  one other thing  the video graphics card is pretty sub par  i tried playing guild wars 2 and it s incredibly slow choppy   to be fair  there are reviews on here stating this is not a gaming computer  just had to find out the hard way  i guess   actually  if you re reading this  is it possible to upgrade the graphics card in this desktop to make it gaming compatible   one other thing  don t get confused with  it comes pre installed with windows 10   if you re like me  perhaps you thought it would come pre installed with microsoft office  but it does not  i guess i really need to brush up on my computer lingo     overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player    overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player because it was broken internally  after replacing it seems to work ok  the casing was a little beat up but  that s what you get for refurbished three starsgenerally like dell  ended up buying a dell computer  but this tower just did not work out for meon the fence about performancejust got everything setup and wanted to write a review  packaging was good  pc worked right out the box but since plugging it in  i ve noticed several issues 1  it s not quiet  i keep hearing a clicking noise 2  moves very slow  even before i attempted to download any software 3  screen blacks out and shuts entire internet session down  i ve never purchased a certified refurbished pc but so far not good  i love that is comes with windows though good bang for your buckgood bang for your buck  daughter can t play minecraft bc of integrated gpu  case isn t standard size limited upgradeability   great web browser three starsa bit slower than i expected fast response  other concerns my dell optiplex   it s a great little machine i loved it    great to play very fast response on clicking actions  but  for some odd reason it glitched on me  so now when i attempt to power it on  it doesn t turn on  only the  3 4  numbers light up on the front the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever hadwindows 10 is all new to me  hard for me to adjust and learn  the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had  i need to follow up to find out why the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have    the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have updated everything and i done all of the troubleshooting and it still randomly reboots  i have no idea why not bad okay so far  two things that future buyers need to be aware of  one  the pc i received did not work with wifi nor could i set it up  had to use a direct ethernet connection to the modem two  windows 10 was not preinstalled for upgrade from windows 7  had to download from microsoft directly  also  it is only 160 gb hard drive  but after win10 installation plus a few others i still had enough space leftover  a little  buggy  at first when trying to set up virus protection and scanning  etc  but after a few days all is working efficiently  not bad too mu8ch space used up by windows 10 too mu8ch space used up by windows 10  should have left the space open to the user not the person who gets the kick back from the advertisersgreat for it s priceit s not too bad but  it s not compatible with many things that i would like to do on it    it s lasting me long enough until i can get a new one  and it s a lot better than the one i used before this  it s a little under priced though  a  100 pc should be a lot worse than how it is now
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase

starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like

starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol

a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price processor not so fast as dual corefour starsfine supportvery nice computer it work good for what i have to    very nice computer it work good for what i have to do with it  four starsquite goodcan t beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

starsvery happy  only thing is speakers are scratchy  sound  and the stand broke early on no sound drivehad trouble installing my printer  no up dated drive  monitor is good but a older model  very heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way overall happy with itthe computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall

it  they were even nice enough to add a wifi hub so i can connect to my wifi  i would buy from them again four starsno issues so far and very easy to install simple and does its job computer works amazing and does its job  only problem was the case had a crack in it  but its cosmetic and more than likely thanks to the delivery rather than the seller so far it works great used for a cnc machine  so far it works great     look old but so far it is working very good the case is look old but so far it is working very good  four starsruns mintgood performance for the price for more money there are certainly better systems  but for the basics  this is great  had to replace the memory after 3 months  still not a bad deal  but down to 4 stars  the machine appears and operates as if new and is very fast  my only complaint would be that it seemed plagued by a number of outdated drivers  although i had to employ a third party vendor to correct this deficiency  the cost was nominal  and overall i am very pleased with the purchase and consider it a wise investment had to purchase a new key board as my old    had to purchase a new key board as my old one had an out dated connection end  no big deal as key boards are really cheap nice computercomputer works well  i don t like windows 10 and seem to be having problems with the email app disappearing but the computer is good four starsworks great  fast and compact  nice machine for the price the computer took forever to get her but it was shipped free  i appreciate that  so far it is performing good  nice machine for the price four starsworking well so far and i been happy with it four starsso far it works fine four starsseems finefour starsso far so good everything as advertised recommended to friendsthe windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set upit is a fast running computer  the windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set up  the start up is the same as any other windows version computer  i bought mine for an excellent price around  95 and it is worth every bit of it  i have had it for two months and use it everyday to do basic computer work and some school studies  it is wifi compatible but they send an antenna with it to pick up the wifi service and the wifi does not work on this device without out it  also there is no bluetooth  so you also have to buy separately a bluetooth transmitter  the wifi antenna they sent with it stopped working with this after a week and i made dozens of calls to local computer servicing businesses and they did not know why so i spent  15 to buy a new one which was very aggravating  also the windows office products do not come with this device so you have to purchase them separately for like  99  it has numerous little bugs and fixes but just for an at home pc to do some work on it works fine  not highly recommended otherwise  my best advise is to do your research and find out exactly what you need and are looking for    don t go wrong with a machine like this cause it can just become a money drain like it has for me  fan is loud  gets hotgets really hot and fan becomes very loud  not on floor or against surfaces blocking vents  works well otherwise four starsthe sound quality is not so goodfour starsperhaps it is my internet connection  but sometimes slow
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent

some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

like excel word  thanks great refurbished computerthis pc runs just fine out of the box  i have yet to run into any problems price is fantastic  switched the hard drive with an ssdprice is fantastic  switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five starsunbeatable price  packaged well  i would definately buy again five starsworked great   five starslove itfive starsfast shipping works great looks brand new five starseverything worked as

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter

piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original

wanted   www jw org  great computer  great company in blair technologygreat computer  great company in blair technology very good for the pricevery good machine for the money  over all this was a good purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

performance computerthe package arrived swiftly and the computer is a good performancefive starsgreat price  met all of my expectationsimpressive  comes with windows 10  wi fi  seamless  plug and play  quiet  simply perfect   impressive  a much better  stronger and faster computer than i expected  just plug and play    it came loaded with windows 10   a substantial investment to buy windows   also  with a backup disk  a usb wireless adapter  not a built in wireless card   and the power cord  it s whisper quiet and ready to rumble    refurbished is as good as new for me  and at a fraction of the cost of a new one   came from linkedpc  inc     i did need to login and register with microsoft  then i downloaded my favorite programs and installed  btw the dvd cd tray works fantastic    my 10 year old dell inspiron bit the dust  i had to have a desktop to replace her  shopping around i accidentally stumbled across this  wow  i scored    it is fast  i am not an online gamer  but  i do use facebook  a lot   have thousands of pictures  watch many youtubes  and play online casino games  ect  there has not even been a hiccup in anything i try to run  seamless    update 10 01 2017  still behaving perfectly  running smooth and fast    i only recommend the very best products and this computer is by far one of them    if you want a good back lit keyboard  with large font  here s the one i bought  imbaprice large font print usb led backlit keyboard  orange and blue  imba lob bkb    if you have any questions  feel free to click my username and send email  i will answer you    hope you found this review useful  thanks exactly as advertised  fully functional for great price exactly what i was told that i would get  was it the greatest computer ever built  no  was it an very very good computer for a very very low price  yes  yes it was  i got it as a christmas present for my mom  i fits all of her computer needs  streams video just fine  smooth and quiet functioning  nothing bad  wifi  wireless printing  noisiness  slow boot up and command response time were my worries  not problems on any of those fronts  it is a more than adequate computer for someone who isn t gaming their way through the internet or doing 100 000 things at once  it works properly and came with everything that it was supposed at an extremely reasonable price  and that is what i wanted  enough said very fast basic computer  at great price bought this to replace a 9 year old dell that was running windows vista  so it was time  i hesitated to get only a core 2 duo  since there are other faster ones  but after reading some of the reviews  and knowing that i only need to do basic web surfing  facebook  word processing  spreadsheets and emails  i thought  how bad can it be for  103   i am so pleased with it  took it out of the box  read the  read this first  sheet inside the box  hooked it up and turned it on  registered the windows 10 software and was up and running in about 20 minutes  this computer is screaming fast compared to the old one and i haven t had a single problem with it  blair technologies seems like a great seller and i had very fast shipping  i highly recommend this computer excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group    excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group to deal with  they will answer any questions and help with any issues  the win 10 installed works flawlessly and the computer looks essentially new  i like that it is not a tower but has a small footprint that allows it to be laid flat on the table  it has foot pads to allow that  the cd dvd drive will work better in that horizontal layout  you can put small items on the top of it since there are no air vents on the top or bottom  i have my modem and router sitting there  while it will work wirelessly  i prefer the easy ethernet wired hookup and use the wireless for my printer  a laptop  tablet  tv  chromebook  etc  with the ethernet connection i get high speeds in spite of the heavy use of the wireless for all those other uses   easy to install and the connections are obvious  no mike or camera but those with a usb connection are very inexpensive and work just fine  good product  excellent price and good support  what s not to like for a little over  100  an awesome product that was exactly what was neededthis is a very simple  straight forward computer that i purchased for the most basic of family needs  ms word  facebook  web surfing      the only thing i had to do was connect the basic attachments  monitor  keyboard and mouse   turn it on and away you go   there are 10 usb ports  a dvd read write and a nice size hard drive for what it will be used for  while i was not expecting such a large cpu tower  it does provide some room for any additional memory  drives ect  an older  refurbished  not super modern computer sometimes fits exactly what is needed  any more would be a waste  the shipping was super fast  it arrived a week early five starsgreat computer at a good value i liked it so much  i bought another one for home use wow  am i impressed  i bought this refurbished little gem to replace my 2012 dell

folks running very high demand processes  i wanted it primarily to play downloaded movies on the big flat screen i have in my sitting area  internet surf and access my huge calibre library of ebooks  it arrived well packaged  clean and ready to go  setup took virtually no time at all and the motor is very quiet  i can t hear it from 6 feet away  wireless is via a dongle rather than built in as other reviewers have noted  but it locked right in the first time and worked like a champ  no hdmi but vga is excellent  as of this writing  i literally cannot think of one negative thing to say about

windows 10  and the wireless adapter works very well  i am thrilled with this purchase  and recommend getting one like this from blair to anyone  excellent customer service  easy setup instructions  they know what they re doing  couldn t be better what a deal i was greatly impressed with this computer for  100  from the time i opened the box  i was set up and on the internet within 15 minutes  i am new to windows 10 so that is taking a little bit to get used to  i use this computer for the sole purpose of making music  the program i run is gigantic in size  approx  20 gb  yet only took about an hour to download  the processor is not the fastest  however what do you expect for a  100 computer  if your expectations are realistic and don t do a great deal of gaming or video streaming  you will love this gem of a deal  the best part of this buy is that other reviewers stated that the wi fi was an external antennae  i don t know if i got lucky  but the cpu i got has an internal antennae great pcthe computer is just as described and works great  i had a dell precision 370 that this optiplex replaced  the optiplex actually came with 250g hd vs 80 which was advertised so thats a plus

needed it for  i have it set up as a video encoding machine running plex for the house  i just leave it on all the time and load all my movies through it  so far after 2 months it is running good best

nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applications
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever bought
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the

was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order

output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no electronic problems  it hangs sometimes  w  linux   could be memory issues no wifijust bought this computer as i needed windows 10 for turbo tax and find out it has no wifi  really  its 2018  what computer has no wifi  anyway  plan on spending another  40 to get a wifi adapter didn t work after installation of software this crashed after installing software two starsno wifi availability      in 2017
decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing games
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows

problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now

rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot

starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and

starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most part
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent

some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just right for what we had in mind perfect    a  plus cosmetic condition  100 percent accurate specs chose this unit after researching and comparing multiple units across all major sellers  including dell hp refurbished sites good this is wonderful  works great awesome so far the computer arrived on time and so far is working great  it is only a month and i haven t started putting software on it for my wah jobs but i will update this review then five starsit is a good product
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping out  i will never buy refurbished computers again buyer bewarereceived this computer 30 days agao and it worked for 2 weeks then went dead  buyer beware arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet    arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet   system locks up when two or three windows are open   constantly  re start   fristrated  cd dvd drive is  junk    ruined two or three discs   just grinds  will not trust another refurbished system  arrived damaged   it arrived poorly packaged and damaged both visibly  and in such a way that i could not open the case to install my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop   also kept endlessly restarting  was on the phone with amazon tech support and after multiple tries and attempts to fix it  he said the motherboard was no good and told me to return it disk error makes it uselesscomputer has disk error after 2 months of use and rarely turns on  not worth the hassle one starslowest version of the hp 8300 that we have purchased recently  i remember to opt for a faster processor disappointed i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even

homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the

getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues  monitor is rally nice for someone who has vision issues and its adjustable worked good for 3 months then monitor went outworked good for 3 months then monitor went out  can t complain pc still works great bought a bigger monitor anyway good service  3 stars because of monitorjust a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an    just a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect bitter sweetso i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not everything the  tower  arrived but never received the screen or the keyboard mouse  for now i m satisfied with the tower and its overall performance three starsit works the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download    the computer arrived on time and in excellent shape  but as i was trying to download a program straight from ea games to help me play the

don t waste your time  for a hundred or two more you will be much happier not overly happyi guess you get what you paid for  the computer is scratched up and good use for kids games but stopped working after the second week    i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yetthe computer is everything that was advertised  i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yet three starsok i guess three starsit worksvery satisfiedit is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programsit is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and

value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase and it came with windows 10 64 bit  running vm and ubuntu without any issue so far shipping was on time with good packing  pc worked goodshipping was on time with good packing  pc worked good quiet

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like  some not  the computer itself functions well everything works great with iteverything works great with it  however the fan is considerable loud  it doesn t bother me though  not for the price     im very satisfied runs great  good valuequick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box had zero damage but other than that it has been working good didn t have wi fi built in  also didn t have enough correct ports for my monitor  but other than that it has been working good so far so

packed well looks newall worked great  packed well looks new  only complaint is an excessively loud cooling fan  so much so im ordering replacement fan four starslow price and it worksfour starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol i love it and it was fairly cheap to get a nice onefour starsgreat product only on amazonfor the price we will be back   best deal on amazon   four starsall that for under  100good system for the

that it was not set to 230v and it blew up ok computergood computer the monitor sucks but if you have another one it looks perfect keyboard is cheapfour starsgood for video streaming and normal internet browsing  but it runs slower after upgrade to windows 10 four starseverything was in excellent condition and is working fine the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price

beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m

for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from

gaming pc that can run fortnite at 100  fps on ultra settings and tom clancy s rainbow six siege at 60  fps on ultra settings     when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five starsunbeatable price  packaged well  i would definately buy again five starsworked great   five starslove itfive starsfast shipping works great looks brand new five starseverything worked as

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just

running  monitor  keyboard and mouse appear to be brand new  the only thing we ve found wrong is a tiny foot missing from the bottom of the computer housing which made it rock a little bit  a tiny piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

functioning  overall i am pleased and i will update if an issue occursgreat computer for the price works super quick and can t beat the price  bought it to replace the ten year old mac that is slow

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original product key  x ed out  i would have thought the computer was new  the only surprise was wifi adapter had to be purchased separately for the one i bought   i must have missed that when i ordered it  other than that oversight  it is great great for my aging eyesthis monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my own home  the windows product key didn t work when i tried entering at the initial set up  but the 2nd time that i tried it it registered correctly without any problems  not sure what the glitch was with that  but i am loving this cost effective set up so glad that i found youso glad that i found you  details written said plug in ready  i did not have to spend hours with internet tech to set up

expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen

me back i have not talked to any one yet   after this unit froze up on me 2 or 3 times and the videos card must have been bad because the screen would jump down when trying to use it  so i just now thru it out the door with the rest of the trash  this one i bought from blair and the other one i bought for a friend was not from blair  so now i have to buy another and it want be from blair  just

to max out the memory it has 2 more slots just can found the right type  don t want to buy wrong kind any help on this  i will update review later one starslowone starpissed  won t even play minecraft story mode game  the only reason i bought this one staritem did not work at allnot recommendeddishonest description and defective product i got what i paid for   shorts on both the psu and the motherboard causes it to randomly power on or off sent it back i am a cheapskate and have bought many used computers over the years  i knew as soon as i took it out of the box that it was not what i wanted to deal with  it still had the previous owner s info  documents  pictures  ect  the usb ports were difficult to use  like they were warped  it came with an internet adapter  not the built in wireless that i wanted  i sent it back within a few days  and i am the type of person that never sends anything back or returns stuff to stores  i just knew it was not for me  i decided to not waste my money and bought a new pc that arrived today delli am u happy with my computer  it doesn t have any better features than my old one  slow as the old one
product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even

this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all  but is in good condition  just sad once again that it wasn t the computer in the picture i seen  oh well    expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality not at all what i expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality two starsit was a 64 bit not 32 which i neededi bbought 2 of these refurbished computers for kids and    i bbought 2 of these

to replace the monitor  ugh two starswindows keeps giving a warning that software not certifieddisappointednot at all what i expected in a refurbished computer  non stop error messages  very slow  and getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the

slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot

1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two

computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not

speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programsit is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says    so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says my window 10 key is not valid so i have to pay for it but the computer does work as it should i have had it now for almost a week and have been using it daily a couple of issues     but otherwise a good computeri ran into a couple of snaffu s with this desktop  side note   i am techno retard  so please excuse my lack of expert terminology   i have a 27  hp monitor that i wanted to use my hdmi cable for optimal picture viewing  but this desktop does not come with an hdmi port   no kidding  look at the pictures   you can use your old school vga monitor cable  but if your monitor supports hdmi  don t expect to have hdmi functionality right of the bat  i did some research and to solve this issue  i bought a displayport to hdmi adapter and connected it to the tiny  unlabeled  illuminated d p port on the back of the computer  my monitor now supports hdmi quality picture  https   www amazon com gp product b017q8zvwk ref oh aui detailpage o03 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 another issue i encountered was slow internet speeds  my desktop came with a 802 11n wireless chip adapter already plugged into one of the back usb ports  i ran an online speed test and wasn t picking up more than 2 mbps  very slow  to solve this issue  i connected an ethernet cable directly to my modem from my desktop and am now picking up 35  mbps  i know this stuff may seem obvious as you re reading it  but it took me a while to figure this stuff out on my own without any help from dell  finally  one other thing  the video graphics card is pretty sub par  i tried playing guild wars 2 and it s incredibly slow choppy   to be fair  there are reviews on here stating this is not a gaming computer  just had to find out the hard way  i guess   actually  if you re reading this  is it possible to upgrade the graphics card in this desktop to make it gaming compatible   one other thing  don t get confused with  it comes pre installed with windows 10   if you re like me  perhaps you thought it would come pre installed with microsoft office  but it does not  i guess i really need to brush up on my computer lingo     overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player    overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player because it was broken internally  after replacing it seems to work ok  the casing was a little beat up but  that s what you get for refurbished three starsgenerally like dell  ended up buying a dell computer  but this tower just did not work out for meon the fence about performancejust got everything setup and wanted to write a review  packaging was good  pc worked right out the box but since plugging it in  i ve noticed several issues 1  it s not quiet  i keep hearing a clicking noise 2  moves very slow  even before i attempted to download any software 3  screen blacks out and shuts entire internet session down  i ve never purchased a certified refurbished pc but so far not good  i love that is comes with windows though good bang for your buckgood bang for your buck  daughter can t play minecraft bc of integrated gpu  case isn t standard size limited upgradeability   great web browser three starsa bit slower than i expected fast response  other concerns my dell optiplex   it s a great little machine i loved it    great to play very fast response on clicking actions  but  for some odd reason it glitched on me  so now when i attempt to power it on  it doesn t turn on  only the  3 4  numbers light up on the front the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever hadwindows 10 is all new to me  hard for me to adjust and learn  the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had  i need to follow up to find out why the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have    the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have updated everything and i done all of the troubleshooting and it still randomly reboots  i have no idea why not bad okay so far  two things that future buyers need to be aware of  one  the pc i received did not work with wifi nor could i set it up  had to use a direct ethernet connection to the modem two  windows 10 was not preinstalled for upgrade from windows 7  had to download from microsoft directly  also  it is only 160 gb hard drive  but after win10 installation plus a few others i still had enough space leftover  a little  buggy  at first when trying to set up virus protection and scanning  etc  but after a few days all is working efficiently  not bad too mu8ch space used up by windows 10 too mu8ch space used up by windows 10  should have left the space open to the user not the person who gets the kick back from the advertisersgreat for it s priceit s not too bad but  it s not compatible with many things that i would like to do on it    it s lasting me long enough until i can get a new one  and it s a lot better than the one i used before this  it s a little under priced though  a  100 pc should be a lot worse than how it is now
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase and it came with windows 10 64 bit  running vm and ubuntu without any issue so far shipping was on time with good packing  pc worked goodshipping was on time with good packing  pc worked good quiet clean  but window 10 product key was missing  return was fast and easy  hope to buy another one with a coa all in all pretty good for the priceall four ddr3  dimm not sodimm becareful guys  were occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only

deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and

very satisfied runs great  good valuequick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box

starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol i love it and it was fairly cheap to get a nice onefour starsgreat product only on amazonfor the price we will be back   best deal on amazon   four starsall that for under  100good system for the

that it was not set to 230v and it blew up ok computergood computer the monitor sucks but if you have another one it looks perfect keyboard is cheapfour starsgood for video streaming and normal internet browsing  but it runs slower after upgrade to windows 10 four starseverything was in excellent condition and is working fine the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price

beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way overall happy with itthe computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall

are certainly better systems  but for the basics  this is great  had to replace the memory after 3 months  still not a bad deal  but down to 4 stars  the machine appears and operates as if new and is very fast  my only complaint would be that it seemed plagued by a number of outdated drivers  although i had to employ a third party vendor to correct this deficiency  the cost was nominal  and overall i am very pleased with the purchase and consider it a wise investment had to purchase a new key board as my old    had to purchase a new key board as my old one had an out dated connection end  no big deal as key boards are really cheap nice computercomputer works well  i don t like windows 10 and seem to be having problems with the email app disappearing but the computer is good four

four starsworking well so far and i been happy with it four starsso far it works fine four starsseems finefour starsso far so good everything as advertised recommended to friendsthe windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set upit is a fast running computer  the windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set up  the start up is the same as any other windows version computer  i bought mine for an excellent price around  95 and it is worth every bit of it  i have had it for two months and use it everyday to do basic computer work and some school studies  it is wifi compatible but they send an antenna with it to pick up the wifi service and the wifi does not work on this device without out it  also there is no bluetooth  so you also have to buy separately a bluetooth transmitter  the wifi antenna they sent with it stopped working with this after a week and i made dozens of calls to local computer servicing businesses and they did not know why so i spent  15 to buy a new one which was very aggravating  also the windows office products do not come with this device so you have to purchase them separately for like  99  it has numerous little bugs and fixes but just for an at home pc to do some work on it works fine  not highly recommended otherwise  my best advise is to do your research and find out exactly what you need and are looking for    don t go wrong with a machine like this cause it can just become a money drain like it has for me  fan is loud  gets hotgets really hot and fan becomes very loud  not on floor or against surfaces blocking vents  works well otherwise four starsthe sound quality is not so goodfour starsperhaps it is my internet connection  but sometimes slow
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

office  came with windows 10  which works fine  you have to authenticate windows using key on the back of the computer  there s a sheet of paper that comes with it stating this  but i am always the person that throws that crap away  so fyi  has no hdmi but does have display port  i had to order a hdmi to display port cable  right now i have it hooked up via vga  i clearly have little knowledge

starsperfect after a couple of monthsi ll start with what i feel  very happy  very minor wear or scratch marks  i m very pleased it plays my older steam games great and with graphics up  it also plays sims 1 3 fantastically  even with all expansions and graphics up  the sims 4 runs great with medium range graphics  everything runs great and fast  i have never had a desktop for over a decade now  feels good to have one and it actually has windows 10 and runs smoothly  for the good  fast and runs the games i want playable even with better graphics  very easy to set up almost looks new size is smaller and lighter than predicted got here in time and was very affordable runs quiet all the time 10 usb ports  idk why but it s nice to have  came with brand new wired keyboard  wired mouse  and mouse pad   very nice thank you  has a quiet sound card built in just in case you don t have speakers to hook up now for the bad  windows 10 isn t activated    code for activation is on a sticker to scratch off   only 500gb hdd no built in wifi   but my old xbox wifi adapter works fine    usb  can t personalize almost anything because it s not activated  no hdmi higher end games do not run well   not what i bought it for anyways   doesn t come with a vga cable last thoughts  super affordable  but sucks it s not activated    came with new accessories which was cool  runs my older game great with graphics on  with the pros and cons this was good buy for me at least  i can do most of my office things and games with no slowing down  my almost looks brand new and i m very grateful for that  great buy and i m happy i have a desktop once again five starsexcellent for the moneyfive starsworks great for a really great price  no problems at all set up was easy and after updating worked just fineworks well  using it for a media server and general web usage  set up was easy and after updating worked just fine perfect boots quickly  and when i juiced it up with a ssd drive and for the primary  and 19 gb of ram will serve me well for years speed and windows 10 faster and greater capacity than my old dell windows 7 desktop  this is windows 10 best bang for the moneyi bought this desktop to use as htpc and i m happy with it  it had some scratch and dent but it performs just as new desktop plenty of capability  and the price was great the price was great  and it has more than enough capability for anything i need to do  including maintaining my websites best deal in desktops out theredollar for performance  this is the best deal out there  fast processor for basic needs  easily upgradeable ram hd  i run mine with a ssd  2tb hdd  16gb ram and a geforce ft 730 low profile gpu  i use it for work  photo editing  and believe it or not  gaming  i don t run anything very intense  but i ve had a lot of success running elder scrolls online  medium   dota 2  high   league of legends  high   and company of heroes  don t expect this to be a gaming pc  but it s sufficient as long as you re not expecting it to play everything on ultra  plays eso on low settings without a gpu  i get around 60 90fps eso with the gt730 good product for the pricefor the price you pay the amount of ram and memory you get is a steal  you can always upgrade the computer later too if you know what you re doing stays cool  no problems so farjust using it for a pfsense router it is quiet  stays cool  no problems so far it works better than i hopedwhat a deal  i just needed this computer for streaming tv shows  movies  youtube etc  it works better than i hoped  i m very satisfied and think this is a great deal  i was buying dell in the past but always had a problem  this computer and the company microbee is the answer to my prayers five starsgreat deal  had a couple scratches on the case  but no problems  to be expected on a refurbished unit smaller size makes it easy to fit somewhere out of the waywhat a deal  smaller size makes it easy to fit somewhere out of the way  all the components are easily accessible  the fan is a little noisy five starsworks just like new but at a lower price  very happy with this product five starsgreat prod  good value  fast ship five

saying this is one of the best computers you can get for the money if you are looking to get into pc gaming then this is the pc this paired with the gtx 1050ti or 1050 plain makes a simple mid range gaming pc that can run fortnite at 100  fps on ultra settings and tom clancy s rainbow six siege at 60  fps on ultra settings     when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop    i m a guy on a budget so when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to buy a new desktop but didn t want to spend on a brand new one  found these great refurbished small form factor desktops with all the speed and processing i was looking for  i love the small form and i love the price   once the package arrived i opened the desktop so i could see it s upgrade potential as the descriptions fall a bit short as to how much one can upgrade the system  i was happy to find that there are several unused pcie slots and other unused connections inside  im very happy with its performance so far and look forward to seeing all this baby can do with future upgrades great desktop pc for the value i bought two pcs for the office and the performance is great

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just right for what we had in mind perfect    a  plus cosmetic condition  100 percent accurate specs chose this unit after researching and comparing multiple units across all major sellers  including dell

wah jobs but i will update this review then five starsit is a good productexcellent so fararrived two and half weeks ahead of schedule  and was well packaged  within 30 minutes computer was up and running  monitor  keyboard and mouse appear to be brand new  the only thing we ve found wrong is a tiny foot missing from the bottom of the computer housing which made it rock a little bit  a tiny piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi capability  using this computer for our malting business  as we didn t need anything fancy  will post video review in the future five starsthe computer works very well i ll buy it againgreat deal

functioning  overall i am pleased and i will update if an issue occursgreat computer for the price works super quick and can t beat the price  bought it to replace the ten year old mac that is slow

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original product key  x ed out  i would have thought the computer was new  the only surprise was wifi adapter had to be purchased separately for the one i bought   i must have missed that when i ordered it  other than that oversight  it is great great for my aging eyesthis monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my own home  the windows product key didn t work when i tried entering at the initial set up  but the 2nd time that i tried it it registered correctly without any problems  not sure what the glitch was

purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

starsit is awesome     powerful desktop pc it s an amazing gaming desktop unit  i have been using this for the past three months and i must say that it s reliable  efficient and fast   it is a good performance computerthe package arrived swiftly and the computer is a good performancefive starsgreat price  met all of my expectationsimpressive  comes with windows 10  wi fi  seamless  plug and play  quiet  simply perfect   impressive  a much better  stronger and faster computer than i expected  just plug and play    it came loaded with windows 10   a substantial investment to buy windows   also  with a backup disk  a usb wireless adapter  not a built in wireless card   and the power cord  it s whisper quiet and ready to rumble    refurbished is as good as new for me  and at a fraction of the cost of a new one   came from linkedpc  inc     i did need to login and register with microsoft  then i downloaded my favorite programs and installed  btw the dvd cd tray works fantastic    my 10 year old dell inspiron bit the dust  i had to have a desktop to replace her  shopping around i accidentally stumbled across this  wow  i scored    it is fast  i am not an online gamer  but  i do use facebook  a lot   have thousands of pictures  watch many youtubes  and play online casino games  ect  there has not even been a hiccup in anything i try to run  seamless    update 10 01 2017  still behaving perfectly  running smooth and fast    i only recommend the very best products and this computer is by far one of them    if you want a good back lit keyboard  with large font  here s the one i bought  imbaprice large font print usb led backlit keyboard  orange and blue  imba lob bkb    if you have any questions  feel free to click my username and send email  i will answer you    hope you found this review useful  thanks exactly as advertised  fully functional for great price exactly what i was told that i would get  was it the greatest computer ever built  no  was it an very very good computer for a very very low price  yes  yes it was  i got it as a christmas present for my mom  i fits all of her computer needs  streams video just fine  smooth and quiet functioning  nothing bad  wifi  wireless printing  noisiness  slow boot up and command response time were my worries  not problems on any of those fronts  it is a more than adequate computer for someone who isn t gaming their way through the internet or doing 100 000 things at once  it works properly and came with everything that it was supposed at an extremely reasonable price  and that is what i wanted  enough said very fast basic computer  at great price bought this to replace a 9 year old dell that was running windows vista  so it was time  i hesitated to get only a core 2 duo  since there are other faster ones  but after reading some of the reviews  and knowing that i only need to do basic web surfing  facebook  word processing  spreadsheets and emails  i thought  how bad can it be for  103   i am so pleased with it  took it out of the box  read the  read this first  sheet inside the box  hooked it up and turned it on  registered the windows 10 software and was up and running in about 20 minutes  this computer is screaming fast compared to the old one and i haven t had a single problem with it  blair technologies seems like a great seller and i had very fast shipping  i highly recommend this computer excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group    excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group to deal with  they will answer any questions and help with any issues  the win 10 installed works flawlessly and the computer looks essentially new  i like that it is not a tower but has a small footprint that allows it to be laid flat on the table  it has foot pads to allow that  the cd dvd drive will work better in that horizontal layout  you can put small items on the top of it since there are no air vents on the top or bottom  i have my modem and router sitting there  while it will work wirelessly  i prefer the easy ethernet wired hookup and use the wireless for my printer  a laptop  tablet  tv  chromebook  etc  with the ethernet connection i get high speeds in spite of the heavy use of the wireless for all those other uses   easy to install and the connections are obvious  no mike or camera but those with a usb connection are very inexpensive and work just fine  good product  excellent price and good support  what s not to like for a little over  100  an awesome product that was exactly what was neededthis is a very simple  straight forward computer that i purchased for the most basic of family needs  ms word  facebook  web surfing      the only thing i had to do was connect the basic attachments  monitor  keyboard and

printer  set up was super easy and quick  just follow the instructions provided  i actually expected the set up to be a lot more cumbersome and time consuming so was also pleasantly surprised by the

folks running very high demand processes  i wanted it primarily to play downloaded movies on the big flat screen i have in my sitting area  internet surf and access my huge calibre library of ebooks  it arrived well packaged  clean and ready to go  setup took virtually no time at all and the motor is very quiet  i can t hear it from 6 feet away  wireless is via a dongle rather than built in as other reviewers have noted  but it locked right in the first time and worked like a champ  no hdmi but vga is excellent  as of this writing  i literally cannot think of one negative thing to say about this  i got it for just under  100 and it s absolutely worth the price good computer  great price it is very basic and works great  i added my own keyboard and mouse and hit the ground running  i signed into my microsoft account and the computer configured appropriately  there was a price drop after i made the purchased  i am still very satisfied with the price i paid and the quality of the

primary one crashed  got this  and what a pleasant surprise  this machine runs as fast and as well as my primary 2 9 ghz dell  even though it s way older  it was easy to set up  easy to register the windows 10  and the wireless adapter works very well  i am thrilled with this purchase  and recommend getting one like this from blair to anyone  excellent customer service  easy setup instructions  they know what they re doing  couldn t be better what a deal i was greatly impressed with this computer for  100  from the time i opened the box  i was set up and on the internet within 15 minutes  i am new to windows 10 so that is taking a little bit to get used to  i use this computer for the sole purpose of making music  the program i run is gigantic in size  approx  20 gb  yet only took about an hour to download  the processor is not the fastest  however what do you expect for a  100 computer  if your expectations are realistic and don t do a great deal of gaming or video streaming  you will love this gem of a deal  the best part of this buy is that other reviewers stated that the wi fi was an external antennae  i don t know if i got lucky  but the cpu i got has an internal antennae great pcthe computer is just as described and works great  i had a dell precision 370 that this optiplex replaced  the optiplex actually came with 250g hd vs 80 which was advertised so thats a plus  the pc and windows 10 has worked great right out of the box which was very well packed   gonna upgrade ram to 8g and a 1t hd and be set good computer for what i needed it for good computer for what i needed it for  i have it set up as a video encoding machine running plex for the house  i just leave it on all the time and load all my movies through it  so far after 2 months it is running good best

not received this yet  but i was happy with ye olde xp and used it beyond the support cancellation   one day it could not be restored   then i bought the azulle fanless small model   and it would not take my ibm m30 keyboard  with that ps2 adaptor   tried to buy another m30  but none as as good as that keyboard   have designed machines with that keyboard   it s special to me such that i bought this computer in hopes that it does not make chicken soup of the alphabet like the azulle did   i never heard of those guys    set the clock  and come back and the time is different  fanless   leave it on all the time  but had no disc drive   this one i can re install autocad and sink my teeth into an engineering project again   am so looking forward to including this computer into my daily life   am overjoyed great deal great deal five starsa ok




nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applications
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever bought
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping out  i will never buy refurbished computers again buyer bewarereceived this computer 30 days agao and it worked for 2 weeks then went dead  buyer beware arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet    arrived in timely manner   was able to access internet   system locks up when two or three windows are open   constantly  re start   fristrated  cd dvd drive is  junk    ruined two or three discs   just grinds  will not trust another refurbished system  arrived damaged   it arrived poorly packaged and damaged both visibly  and in such a way that i could not open the case to install my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the

slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot

1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing games
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i

starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like

were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most part
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

present and clean  everything was as advertised  the cpu was actually faster than what was listed works like a champworks like a champ  upgraded from my dinosaur with windows xp which i loved   but

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

straightforward machine with solid performance  works well as an entry level gamer after adding small format msi gts 1050 ti video card i like it received this yesterday  so i will update this review if my opinion changes  great computer  i work mostly at home and needed a new computer and decided to go with a cheaper desktop  haven t really installed any big programs yet  will probably install office  came with windows 10  which works fine  you have to authenticate windows using key on the back of the computer  there s a sheet of paper that comes with it stating this  but i am always the

as long as you re not expecting it to play everything on ultra  plays eso on low settings without a gpu  i get around 60 90fps eso with the gt730 good product for the pricefor the price you pay the

saying this is one of the best computers you can get for the money if you are looking to get into pc gaming then this is the pc this paired with the gtx 1050ti or 1050 plain makes a simple mid range gaming pc that can run fortnite at 100  fps on ultra settings and tom clancy s rainbow six siege at 60  fps on ultra settings     when my older compaq was dying a slow and painful death  i decided to

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five

everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter thoughhad it for a month now  works fine  needs a wifi adapter though  good for playing low end games five starsneed how to hook upgreat productthis was just what we needed  it is fast and fit just right for what we had in mind perfect    a  plus cosmetic condition  100 percent accurate specs chose this unit after researching and comparing multiple units across all major sellers  including dell hp refurbished sites good this is wonderful  works great awesome so far the computer arrived on time and so far is working great  it is only a month and i haven t started putting software on it for my wah jobs but i will update this review then five starsit is a good product
the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping

conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the

was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box

product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no

computer has no wifi  anyway  plan on spending another  40 to get a wifi adapter didn t work after installation of software this crashed after installing software two starsno wifi availability      in 2017slowthis computer is so slow it s almost unusable  it also doesn t have speakers built in tried everything to get wifi to operate on this computer    tried everything to get wifi to operate on this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all  but is in good condition  just sad once again that it wasn t the computer in the picture i seen  oh well    expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality not at all what i expected it s extremely slow and the keyboard is very poor quality two starsit was a 64 bit not 32 which i neededi bbought 2 of these refurbished computers for kids and    i bbought 2 of these

to replace the monitor  ugh two starswindows keeps giving a warning that software not certifieddisappointednot at all what i expected in a refurbished computer  non stop error messages  very slow  and getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the

all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win

1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two

computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not

thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second

1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all storage  computer now boots from power button to windows sign in in 9 sec flat good no frills systemgood no frills system  my wife s computer died  hp from stables about 3 years old  400  the hp certified systems are the way to go   200  if it lasts for 2 3 years it is well worth it  now me and my wife have one  i will always purchase systems this way  certified refurbished  it came clean and ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like

starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were

unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was

beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the

starsvery happy  only thing is speakers are scratchy  sound  and the stand broke early on no sound drivehad trouble installing my printer  no up dated drive  monitor is good but a older model  very heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way overall happy with itthe computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall

wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and many newer computers that would be considered out of many people s price range  no complaints at all perfect price great computerthis is perfect for my sone  his laptop was old and well used  nothing worked  he wanted a new one so bad for gaming and homework but we could not afford a new one  always leary of refurbished but with amazon  and sellers guarantee i felt confident enough to give it a try  computer works perfectly  price was affordable and even came with windows 10 which i love for parental controls  would definitely buy from this seller again  a  issue cleared upit does not come with windows activated  vendor provided activation instruction upon request  simple setup instruction flyer in the package would have simplified the process  so far works as expected not so good   called amazonfirst one i bought   not so good  called amazon they had ups pick it up and i ordered another one they sent it next day no shipping charge were extremely helpful and patient while i did all of my reorder and so forth on a 5 year old kindle fire  lol so the new one showed up plugged everything in and away we go this machine hauls ass and if i had the money i would buy it all over again definitely worth the hassles you couldn t build a new one for the cost of this operating system alone is 80 bucks plus the cost of a hard drive and aggravation  awesome buy  very pleasedjust unbelievably awesome for the pricejust unbelievably awesome for the price  amazing    i have a very small business and we are struggling with finances as we have only been in business for 6 or so months  thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  the price seemed almost to good to be true  this product works better then any laptop or desktop i have purchased from the microsoft store    and those products cost at least 3x s the price  we are very thankful  great supportolder unit that still does the basics perfectly well  unit crapped out about 4 months into a 3 month warranty but very supportive help via real time emails with seller  turned out to be a  13 memory chip that went bad  excellent response easily earned 5 stars for this seller  thanks works great for the investmentworks

amazing price for a great computeramazing price for a great computer  if you just want a simple  inexpensive computer  this is the one  i would expect to not get as good of a parts selection with the price  but i am very happy with processor selection and storage and os for this low of a price  i guess it s because it is reconditioned  but you can t tell it s not brand new  more port options than i was expecting also  all in all a great purchase very nice computer i purchased this for a friend and am very impressed  very nice windows 10 image with no extra bloatware  computer runs excellent and it came with everything needed to hook it up and start using  you can tell that they take pride in their refurbish process  i would buy another in a heartbeat great computer for average user

a nvidia gt 710 low profile graphics card so i could get some better performance then the intel hd 2500 graphics and to also get an hdmi port i love this pc it is so good for the price and i even play some slightly lower end games  might i add im using the gt 710 to play the games on the integrated graphics chip great value and good performancetook a little longer to get here since it came from canada  but not bad  ordered 2 for work and both look essentially new and work perfectly  not cutting edge  as expected  but quick and powerful enough for most peoples applications in my opinion

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

like excel word  thanks great refurbished computerthis pc runs just fine out of the box  i have yet to run into any problems price is fantastic  switched the hard drive with an ssdprice is fantastic  switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five starsunbeatable price  packaged well  i would definately buy again five starsworked great   five starslove itfive starsfast shipping works great looks brand new five starseverything worked as

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter

piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it is not exactly as the picture shows   mine arrived with an hp monitor  there are some visible wear and tear  however  everything seems to function perfectly   so i am well pleased  especially with it being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original

other than that oversight  it is great great for my aging eyesthis monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my

purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

the pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damagedthe pc arrived in terrible condition the box and pc were damaged  how the pc works i cant tell you but it does  it also did not come with power cord  key board or mouse as listed  badso very disappointed i would love to be able to say i loved this  per description it met all of my needs and then some  after checking with my techy daughter and being reassured that it was okay to buy refurbished items and seeing that this was a top seller  i thought why not  the price was more than good  i was excited when i opened it  i liked the look of it  it seemed to have what i wanted  until i actually plugged it in and turned it on  no os  blank screen with and error message asking for a disc to be inserted  wtf  i called the number provided for service and got voicemail  i left the requested detailed message   three days in a row  nothing  they not only don t answer phones  they don t return messages either  i returned this pos  so very disappointed  now the computer that i was replacing gave up the ghost entirely and i am totally stuck on this tablet  back to shopping  tried to save a buck and got burned  so frustrated hp 8300 elitethis pc quit after one week  the hard drive would work when it felt like it  it finally went dead and i returned the pc for a refundbad enough the cover was brokenrun away    bad enough the cover was broken  i could deal with that   they give you a bootleg copy of windows with no product code so you have to buy windows 10bad impressionthe certified refurbished hp was delivered in poor condition  it had slightly greasy feel to it and it looked like it had not even been wiped down  i know it was refurbished but you mean to tell me that they couldnt even clean it      very bad first impression  will not be buying any products from this company anymore shipped with error 2234 heci bad motherboardshipped with error 2234 heci  a bad motherboard  this error popped up on first turn on  find it hard to believe this wasn t noticed when it was  tested and certified do not buy if you want it to last more than a yeari cannot say enough about this desktop  i use it for my plex server running linux mint  it is really fast and capable of 5 or 6 trans coded movie plays at the same time without breaking a sweat  great value  might be buying another just for a desktop for myself  only a few scratches but for the money i knew that it would have some and still worth it  do not care about a scratch when the machine itself runs without a problem  i changed my review to a 1 because the machine just died  at less than a year i now do not have a machine to run plex  replaced the hard drive and still does not power on  will not buy one again slower than my 5 year older computeri bought this in july of 2017 as a refurbished pc  it works  but is much slower than my 2 6 ghz 6 ram pc it replaces  and it doesn t have hdmi  which i knew  but figured there d be attachments available to bypass that shortcoming   so far i ve tried several attachments  but none work  if you have the patience and don t mind not being able to have the output to anything other than your monitor  you may enjoy it  i definitely don t bsod1 5 stars  it runs well when it wants  this pc has been a problem sense i bought  it loves crashing  blue screen of death  also  apparently this pc doesnt have good usb ports  some days they barely work  some days no issue  no idea  i just feel like selling it off and go for something else  this really disappointed me good luck trying to figure this out with hpthe system crashed after 4 weeks and cant return it any more  good luck trying to figure this out with hp  the first one wouldn t work out of the box was able to replace for this one  basically both of them are junk do not buy i have been using amazon for probably 5 years now and this was hands down the worst purchase i have ever made  i would highly recommend not getting it  it took about 2 weeks to get delivered which wouldn t be a big deal if i can working  i got this for my brothers birthday and it just wouldn t turn on  i mean the power would turn on but wouldn t go to the monitor  after 2 days i finally found out that it was one of the ram s  memory  so now it only has 6gb of memory instead of 8  plus it just feels slow in general  not sure if it s because of the lost ram or what  i know it s not a gaming pc but it couldn t even run minecraft on the lowest possible settings  i didn t want to have to return it but i m most likely going to  if i could give this product 0 stars i would i can t even change wallpaperthe key is not activated do not buy this      the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed    hp 8300 elite desktop  the first thing i wanted to do is check all internal components  i had to pry it apart with large screwdrivers and disassemble the latch and put in a thumbscrew   i have read this is an issue with these type latches with hp but figured a seller with this high rating would have checked  their response was it must have happened during shipping and said we apologize  really  the components seem to be fine and i am pleased now that i have installed a 240gb ssd and disassembled the latch and replaced with thumbscrew  i have read other reviews of people complaining about latches being stuck and returning the machine but i didn t feel like waiting another couple of weeks for another with possibly the same problem  my advice on who to buy it from since there are 5 10 sellers of this same item is to go with the cheapest with prime shipping  i went for the seller with the highest positive reviews and paid more and still got a machine i had to fix  if you don t mind the latch issue the machine performs pretty well not much to look at   this computer is not a tower  this computer is not a small form factor  it sits flat like the computers of days long gone by  and what is this  a stall for placing a 3 5 floppy drive  not happy with this old timer  can t wait to see how it runs once i try to fit it in my office this evening  it is like i bought it from a flea market or something  i m going to have this baby partying again like it s 1999 so both are now useless to merecieved this today  and was under the impression it had an hdmi port  as it stated hd video  and hd cannot transmit over rgb cable  and when googled this model on hp website it stated it did have hdmi port  only reason i got it as my monitor does not have any other connection other than hdmi  so both are now useless to me  is there one you have with hdmi had problems with internet  the computer was not properly    had problems with internet  the computer was not properly bench checked prior to shipping out  i will never buy refurbished computers again buyer bewarereceived this computer 30 days agao and it worked for 2 weeks then went dead  buyer beware arrived in timely manner   was able to access

three discs   just grinds  will not trust another refurbished system  arrived damaged   it arrived poorly packaged and damaged both visibly  and in such a way that i could not open the case to install my wireless card  there was that built up on the fan for the power supply  i do not have faith in their refurbishing process  nor for this computer to last long at all  very disappointedthis product has windows 10 which is non compatible with    this product has windows 10 which is non compatible with this machine  i have contacted microsoft   they checked it out and incompatibility was the conclusion froze and crashed repeatedly from the beginningin the first few days that i had it  it froze repeatedly and crashed  i ran windows troubleshooting  restarted it several times  etc  i finally sent it back  i have had many pcs over the past 25 years or so  and this is by far the worst  the company should lose its status as a certified refurbisher i should have known betteri realize this is a refurbished unit but this looks like it s been through a war zone  the entire back side was destroyed  returned right away and had to order another  let s hope the 2nd one comes in better shape did not workthe product was advertized as reconditioned  however it couldn t have been plugged in and checked  the plug for the screen did not work  tried two different screen   plug combinations   the fan was very loud and couldn t have been missed if it had been checked out i guess they don t qa there productthe computer started with an error screen  saying something that can not install windows 10  reboot it the same error  the fan is noisy too  usually these desktops are really quite so very disappointed in getting helpi have had nothing but problems since i purchased this machine  they sent me new ram saying that was the problem  it will just shut down in the middle of me working  so very disappointed in getting help  now they are telling me its still the ram but i need to find the issue and repurchase something that was in the computer to begin with  not what i expect from a company    was not pleased with this computer purchasewas not pleased with this computer purchase  it came with a scam version of windows  it also stopped working after 2 weeks     hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot    hate to return the first one because it wouldn t boot properly    ordered another one i hope it works  because i really need it for work  if the next one is better i ll change my rating   not what i orderedat least they have now changed the description to match the product  i believed i was buying a windows 7 machine and would not accept windows 10  on top of that  mine kept bitching to reconnect to the internet despite the fact that it was hard wired to my router with a cat 5 cable  returned didn t workdidn t work at all  parts jingling around inside too  was returned seems like they should have tested itdidn t work out of the box  windows wouldn t even boot  had to return it  seems like they should have tested it arrived doadoa    received the item promptly and upon inspection it was clean and all appeared to be in order visually  in fact i was very happy with the condition as it looked almost new  however  the pc would not work  it would power on and check the cd then nothing  no hd activity  no boot up and no video output  checked all and reseated all connections but no luck  returned for refund lied  no keyboard  mouse or power cable i bought this computer thinking i can plug it in right away  turns out no keyboard  mouse or power adapter came with the computer even when it said it s included flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop defective  flickering screen  although the monitor was fine when i used it for my laptop   also kept endlessly restarting  was on the phone with amazon tech support and after multiple tries and attempts to fix it  he said the motherboard was no good and told me to return it disk error makes it uselesscomputer has disk error after 2 months of use and rarely turns on  not worth the hassle one starslowest version of the hp 8300 that we have purchased recently  i remember to opt for a faster processor disappointed i purchased this computer thinking it was a great deal but when i finally got to use it  after the return period i noticed it was defective the screen consistently goes blurry and the computer will restart   i contacted the seller and he implied i mishandled the computer but did give me suggestions of how to fix the issue all of which failed one starwouldn t load and operate right out of the box had to return it the same day i received itbetter to buy new than throw your money away here i bought this

time i buy something refurbished it doesnt work right or not work at all in the first place it didnt come with wifi you needed a cord i paid a tech to come out and set it up twice because he had to get the right cords and wifi it worked when he was here my wife turned it on this my all it had was a blue screen so i called amazon they tried to fix it and couldnt so i called hp support they said i had the wrong number so then i called the seller they didnt answer wanted me to leave a message you have to understand we are into 2 hours now and nothing so im sending this piece of crap back  im telling you dont buywe went out and purchased an adapter from best buy for  39we were very surprised to see that the computer did not come with a wireless adapter  we went out and purchased an adapter

me back i have not talked to any one yet   after this unit froze up on me 2 or 3 times and the videos card must have been bad because the screen would jump down when trying to use it  so i just now thru it out the door with the rest of the trash  this one i bought from blair and the other one i bought for a friend was not from blair  so now i have to buy another and it want be from blair  just now installed it  works good faster than my old one  it was cheaper to buy this computer with windows 10 on it than to update to my older computer to windows 10  i just want to buy more memory sticks to max out the memory it has 2 more slots just can found the right type  don t want to buy wrong kind any help on this  i will update review later one starslowone starpissed  won t even play minecraft story mode game  the only reason i bought this one staritem did not work at allnot recommendeddishonest description and defective product i got what i paid for   shorts on both the psu and the motherboard causes it to randomly power on or off sent it back i am a cheapskate and have bought many used computers over the years  i knew as soon as i took it out of the box that it was not what i wanted to deal with  it still had the previous owner s info  documents  pictures  ect  the usb ports were difficult to use  like they were warped  it came with an internet adapter  not the built in wireless that i wanted  i sent it back within a few days  and i am the type of person that never sends anything back or returns stuff to stores  i just knew it was not for me  i decided to not waste my money and bought a new pc that arrived today delli am u happy with my computer  it doesn t have any better features than my old one  slow as the old one
product looked clean but no operating system foundi just bought this computer and was initially impressed as the unit looked very clean  no smell   the enclosed keyboard and mouse also looked to be in very good shape  however after i plugged it in all that came up  after many attempts   on my monitor repeatedly was   an operating system wasn t found   i had ordered this computer because the description said windows 10 pro  64 bit   there were no instructions enclosed or what to do if the computer was not initially working  so i had to take another couple of hours to bag it back up and take it to ups as i did not know if i had a lemon or not and did not want to get caught accepting a uncertain product  it s a shame because if the refurbisher seller  had just included instructions or what to do and who to call in event of problems everyone may have been saved a great deal of time  maybe this will prompt them to include simple basic set up instructions you get what you pay for i don t recall ever purchasing refurbished machines before buying 3 of these  i needed 6 machines  and the price for these hp s was really low compared to new  so  i gave it a shot  and now i know  one of them had usb controller issues right out of the box  and another had a catastrophic hard drive failure within 2 months  the second issue really cost me a lot of time  and data  warning  very heavily used hard drive  bought from ustecno  everything seems to be in good working order  but i have one significant complaint  i know these computers are refurbished  but i received one with a hard drive that has already had 41 710  power on  hours  that s just way  way too much use time to turn around and re sell to consumers  in fact  that s way more use time than the hard drive i m replacing   i can t recommend these  for this reason disappointingdisappointing  the back of the machine was bashed in  dented  the keyboard and mouse are ast brand  not hp  it looks like a unit that came off lease  not something that was opened  returned  and refurbished  then to make matters worse  they put the label to register windows on the bottom of the unit  so if you don t take a pic of it before you install it  you will have to take it out  get the info  reinstall  and reboot to register  i would have been better off to pay  500 for a machine from sams  than to bother with this junk scratch off windows 10 product key is impossible to remove without damaging the label the computer seems ok  but all these refurbished computers come with a microsoft windows 10 pro sticker with a scratch off portion to reveal the entire product key  of the 3 refurbished computer i have purchased  all 3 have been impossible to remove the scratch off portion without damaging the label and making the key unreadable  since i had trouble with the first 2  i was super careful and used only gentle pressure with my fingernail to remove this scratch off  on the first 2 i tried with a nickel and a dime  neither of which worked  in the first 2 cases  after more than an hour on the phone with microsoft for each computer  i was able to get a product key that worked  i m just about to call microsoft to try for this 3rd computer  i am not sure if this is a microsoft issue or an issue with the way the refurbisher applies the labels  but it is a real pain for the customer buyer bewarethese models are very good for work stations overall  however  the parties whom re furbish these might need a lesson in workmanship you might want to avoid this model  they tend to be slower than they should be  and they are not properly pre loaded upon arrival after purchased i ve purchased my share to learn this not quite as describeditem does not look new  as description states  not even close  actually  mine came with a broken front grill  it s not shipping damage   worn looking stickers  bent tabs on the case  and the black paint of the shell was obviously touched up with paint  the good is that the inside appeared clean and it appears to work just fine  it s going to be my workshop workstation so  fortunately  i m not too concerned about cosmetics on this  otherwise i d probably consider sending it back two starsits ok not greatbought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we    bought systems 3 months ago  tested hdds as we regularly do on a quarterly basis to verify failing error sectors by performing butterfly reads  both drives showed failing sectors and errors  reported a return but all i wanted was a new hdd with the os installed on it  which they honored by sending us 1 250gb which obviouslly doesn t even meet up to the specs at which was purchased  i have 15 years experience selling new and recert systems and this is not what is categorized as  recert  when they aren t even putting new drives in the systems still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests    still reviewing this computer  need to run some tests on it to push its boundaries and ensure there are no

this computer  with research i found out that the computer was configured in 2009 and was not wifi capable  in fact  it did not contain the soft ware for wireless capability  i could only return this item  i also noticed that when windows 10 is installed on older models there is a problem getting wifi to operate on it bad purchase i bought this computer a couple months ago for the kids to do their homework  and now just stop working i trying to get in touch with the seller if he can fix it  he never get back to me the computer was nothing like the one advertisedthe computer was nothing like the one advertised  the one i received was super old looking  the price was awesome  just wish i would have received the computer i thought i was paying for exactly  didn t come with a wifi adapter at all

getting worse  every other refurbished item i have bought worked like new it works fine for now  but          the product is assembled and is not really a bad buy for the price i paid and the tasks i need it to perform  i would have rated it higher except the product arrived in dubious condition for a product advertised as refurbished  despite the fact that the external packaging was pristine and the fact that the product was adequately protected and packaged for shipping  the computer s external casing was not properly in place to the point that the disk driver was shoved back about 1 2 to 3 4 inch into the unit and couldn t even open to accept a disk  i considered returning the computer because i was afraid that if i fixed it myself and it still didn t work i would be blamed for the problem and denied a refund  however  i decided that i would risk it and took the cover off  repositioned the dvd driver so it could operate  and reassembled to unit s cover to see if it would indeed work  then to my amazement  when plugging everything in in preparation to start the computer up  i found the the mouse usb way very badly bent and would not fit into the usb port  i had to bend it back into a usable shape with a pair of pliers to get it to slide into the adapter and make a proper connection  when i finally fired it up  i found that although everything seems to be working properly  windows has a warning on the screen that my windows software is not genuine  as of right now i have not yet been able to resolve that particular issue  but the computer is at least operating and performing the tasks that i purchased it to do disapointedi ordered a computer with windows 7 and wifi installed  i received a computer with windows 10 and no wifi  i could not connect to the internet of course so i bought an external wireless adapter  i still could not connect to the internet  i had to take it in to a computer repair man and he said there was a setting wrong  he fixed it and it works fine now  after another  105 00 don t buy  refurbished   phooey   whatwas refurbished about this piece of junk  someone needs to tell me because it isn t apparent from turning it on tried

decent specs  works fine   just don t expect it to be in great shape or not smell hardware   if you are looking for a decent  powerful workstation for normal desktop use  ie not gaming  then this is a good value  the i5 cpu in this machine is still plenty fast and you shouldn t have any problems with lag or speed  the 8gb of ram is also nice especially this cheap  these machines should be reliable for years to come but the included 5 year old seagate hard drive would give me pause  with any older machine you start to worry about the mechanical hard drive after a period of time   this is no different  i factored in the purchase of a 250gb ssd into this which makes the machine fly even faster anyway  overall this makes more sense  at least to me  than buying a new machine that s less powerful  condition  ok this is where things get dicey  the ad promises  and certified by the manufacturer or by a third party refurbisher to look and work like new  with limited to no signs of wear  ha  they are literally grabbing these things from expired leases  re imaging the drives with a default windows 10 and kicking them out the door   perhaps literally  sure the machine had scratches and nicks   a bit more than  normal  use but whatever  definitely not  like new   it also had a dented case   so bad the cover wouldn t close without having someone bend the latch to make it fit  it s going under the desk whatever i don t care but this is hardly a well cared for re manufacture this was done quick  cheap and dirty  what really got me though was the smell  out of the box this thing reeked of curry  it was so bad it made the entire room smell like an indian restaurant  it took me about 3 days of a combo of vinegar  baking soda and letting it  air  out to get the smell down to acceptable levels  obviously quality isn t a big concern here  bottom line  if you are looking for a cheap  decent desktop but don t care if it looks like it was kicked down the stairs then stored in a box chicken tikka for 6 months then you ll be ok not delivered as advertisednot as advertised i purchased this machine primarily because my previous hp machine that i had updated to windows 10 from windows 7  when ms was offering that free upgrade  started  hanging  every time ms issued an update  i could not seem to resolve that conflict  i was looking for a not too expensive route to get me back online with updates again  first off     let me say that the machine arrived in excellent condition  i wasn t disappointed there  once i finally got all my applications  favorites  utilities  etc  installed on this machine  everything seemed to function satisfactorily  now for the part where i downgrade my rating  this refurbished machine was advertised as having an intel core i5 processor as well as the windows 10  professional  edition os  it came with neither of these  the specs were one of the primary reasons i selected this machine  frankly i m surprised amazon allows this sort of  bait   switch  tactic  it s clearly false advertising   see my attachments  you can see what was advertised and what came delivered on the machine weird happening gave it three stars because the computer  out of the box  was plenty quick enough for what i had to do and looked to be in good shape  started getting weird when  after a couple of days  i was asked to register windows 10  when i went to register  microsoft said the the os in question was not valid and said to validate i had to pay for the full version  okay  i waited a couple of days and tried again  same thing  then it started to really get weird  i had another user listed as an administrator  one day when trying to log on her user name disappear entirely  i went through my log on and found  not her name  but an entirely different user name set up as an administrator  but didn t show up on the start up screen  i called amazon and they said send it back and sent me the prepaid return label  as an aside  please be careful when purchasing square trade warranty for refurbs  i was told by an amazon rep that square trade doesn t warranty refurbs and that sometimes it appears on screen in error because amazon s programming doesn t catch it a good price  but check it out carefully when it arrivesi had trouble with my refurbished unit right from the start and had to reinstall the windows operating system  then  repeated errors in the hard drive  after a couple of months i contacted the seller and they replaced the hard drive  though the hard drive i received was made in 2011  we ll see how this one does  i wanted a second desktop for music composing and publishing and this had what i needed  it s not my primary computer so it won t see as much action  a good price  it is very easy to access the internal components  one lift of the access lever and you re in  then everything either slides up or pops off  very convenient  even a novice could change the hard drive  given that the novice had some knowledge of things mechanical   thanks to the seller for following up with me quickly and standing behind their product  i realize that i should have contacted the seller immediately when it arrived to tell them of the necessity of reinstalling windows came with 7 instead of 103 star for a decent product  2 stars for seller  specs are good and a decent computer  lied about windows 10 though  it s got windows 7 pro installed  gonna see if i can activate windows 10 with the product number i would recommend this machine for the price  but use a different supplier  not round sam great machine for the price  however  did not come with keyboard and mouse as advertised and i got no response from roundsam  bought a video adapter for dmi cable and got no video output  not sure if it s the adapter or the motherboard  i had a video card in my old hp and plugged that into the graphics slot on motherboard then used my hdmi cable to monitor and everything worked great  don t ask for a five star rating if the product is not going come completely as advertised or if you haven t verified that everything works  your customer service can take the time to request a 5 star rating but they can t take the time to respond to customer complaints  thanks but no thanks well the packaging was fine  product workedwell the packaging was fine  product worked  i had to buy a wireless adapter because there are no wireless drivers  at the moment this product has a non genuine copy of windows  there was no product key in or on the box   but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp       hp does not support windows 10 for this device     my audio is randomly stopping  hitting  test  on the device enables sound again  my first step  after reinstalling the audio driver  was to update it  but it looks like there is none as diver support for the hp compaq elite 8300 sff stops at widows  8 works good  but a strange size and seems that it    works good  but a strange size and seems that it is an old model but upgraded internally  time will tell if worth them money  after receiving two of them i would have rather opted to purchase new mehi bought 2 and they both have non stop hard drive chatter  they seem much slower than i expected for these specs  i ve bought refurb many times in the past and it was ok but these machines seemed like junk from the moment i took them out of the box  i ll run a long defrag and see if that helps the chatter but first impressions are not great decent machine for the price but a few issues to    decent machine for the price but a few issues to bring to light    1   the hard drive was manufactured in 2011  2   cmos battery reports it s dead during post when it s turned back on from shut down  3   for some reason if multiple drives are plugged in it only recognises 1 drivewhile the price is great and it s works perfectly wellwhile the price is great and it s works perfectly well  it wasn t cleaned externally at all  arrived covered in dust at dirt very good pc for the pricewasn t able to use the display port yet with dp2hdmi adapter  just vga  otherwise very good pc for the price it does good except the power connect socket has some problemit does good except the power connect socket has some problem  i got the power cable in the position the computer likes and have it fixed in that position  as long as i dont touch the cable works good otherwise it shuts off it works while it last  the only gripes i    it works while it last  the only gripes i had is that it didn t come with backup software in case you need to reboot  for the price  how can you complain windows 7 not 10my only problem is it does not have windows 10 it has 7 on it everything else is finenice  but they sent me a 6300  not an 8300i received this in a day  which was great  nicely packaged with a new keyboard and mouse  the processor and hard drive were as specified  and it included a windows 10 key  which worked just fine  but  it was an hp 6300 elite small form factor  not an 8300 as specified  for that reason  i m downgrading my review to three stars not happy   lost time and revenuereceived refurbished system  power supply has a loud fan cavitation  245 windows updates later i was able to install paper port 14 pro   net framework 4 0 took forever to install due to missing updates  have not been able to use the system for 2 days since i have been trying to complete all the updates  i had to pull it from my clients office over the weekend to finish all the above bs  not happy   lost time and revenue the pc worked great until it didn tthe pc worked great until it didn t  i suddenly had a bunch of trouble with internet explorer freezing up  then it locked me out of outlook  after doing the recovery thing  all seems to be well  for now three starsaverage inexpensive computer came from canada  works well  not sure about  certified refurbished was not obvious that this came from canada  was set up for canada locale settings  which i had to change to usa   keyboard was pretty horrible  and strangely laid out   mouse was decent enough  computer was clean  looking nearly new  missing a couple of pci slot covers on the back  i bought another of this same version from another company and it was obviously  microsoft certified refurbished   i had to register it with a special code on the computer   this one seemed like they pulled an image off the shelf  i m a little dubious of the certified refurbishiness of this one  overall  it s working and seems to be fine three starsworks well but refuses to enter into sleep mode when  asked  to do so three starsgreat item for the price  the power supply went out within a week of having the devicebeware  the quality control may not be up to    beware  the quality control may not be up to par when they verify the components of these refurb machines before they go out the door  i ordered this one and it came with only 1 4gb dimm and the hard drive was not the 3tb advertised size  but  you re buying refurb so it s a gamble going in keyboard was stickythe keyboard was very sticky  might be reconditioned but not cleaned three starsshort livednot as picturedit is just okay  it is not a high standing desk top as it was pictured  instead it lies flat with the monitor on top three starslove the computer  however  i should wait until today  black friday  and get better deal     no wifi or bluetoothi wish the company had explained in the discription the tower had no features like wifi or bluetooth  i feel like these are standard features i did not receive  nor was i made aware of that three starsdisappointed it does not have an sims card port  three starshardware fine some issues with the osthree starsits slow and a little noisy not just for business perfect starter pc for an 8 year old  can play minecraft and other builder games  with some settings reduced  with great parental control including schedule control and notification  win 10   most importantly  it s not a chromebook  tablet  or some other reduced capacity machine three starsjust okpc for employernot too snappy  but it does the job i bought it to do planned i5 3470   1050ti  350 pc turned into a budget gaming pc nightmare well coming from a amd athlon ii x2 220 with 4gb ram and ati hd 4200 integrated graphics this is better  however the power supply is 240 watts so sticking a 1050 ti in there is impossible and the latch is stuck on the handle to open the side panel  on a side note the only display i have access to uses vga which is old tech by now and i am lucky that it has a vga port but i would have prefered dvi which my monitor has  its a shame that this was supposed to be a  200 pc   a 1050ti so around  350 pc but the problems above stop this from being able to play the original skyrim at playable framerates  well atleast the hd i5 2500 integrated can play minecraft at 60fps at settings i have not seen since 2013 which is default settings and then some with optifine  well i am a idiot for not looking at the power supply specs and matched them to the 1050 ti s minimum  it is a great basic pc though  minus playing gameshsppy eith purchase i received the computer quickly and without issue  the computer works fine and as expected  the only note i would like to make is that the description of the computer said reconditioned and was presented as a near new  i expected yes it was something that had been returned and reconditioned to make it sellable again  the monitor is used and had scrapes along the edges  it is clearly a used monitor  the computer has dust in the vents and looks like it is used as well  while these are nothing major to me it is a bit deceiving  for the price u an happy with what i received basic computer and nothing morevery basic computer  as mentioned in the title  does not come with speakers  does not come with any pre programed  typical  operations like microsoft office  i don t see this as being a computer that will withstand moves or relocations  i had bought it for business  but am going to need to invest in a hardier version with more programs and memory  easy to set up and connect to various devices like printers and usb cables  it s priced affordably  but then you get what you pay for okay for it s priceno good for online gaming  too badhad to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason when i got it was not even the same one add on the site had to take it all ready to get fixed two times all ready keeps cutting out for some stupid reason great priceproblems with black out it will just go blank on you for no reason  keyboard suck but its really cheap and mouse also  so its refurbished and good buy for price but has issues  monitor is rally nice for someone who has vision issues and its adjustable worked good for 3 months then monitor went outworked good for 3 months then monitor went out  can t complain pc still works great bought a bigger monitor anyway good service  3 stars because of monitorjust a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an    just a tad annoyed that it wont connect to the internet without an adapter  include that info upfront so people can order one at the same time as the computer instead of finding out after an hour trying to connect bitter sweetso i love this computer but it started messin up second day im so heartbrokencomputereverything we got with the computer was great and a great value  the tower however was a different story  the tower was still full and will cost us quite a bit to get all undone  we will not be buying refurbished on anything anymore very nice  i wish the description was more clear if    very nice  i wish the description was more clear if it had win 7 or 10 it was only win 7  so i am unable to use the market to download without win 10 its okay for the priceyou get what you pay for   disappointed with the condition and quality of the items  the computer was dell but nothing else was  monitor mouse keyboard   the monitor had a piece broken off the corner  though it does still work  there were no speakers included and the usb port on the mouse was broken so i couldn t plug it in  lastly  the the items appeared physically dirty  when i would expect that they would be given a quick wipe down before shipping  i understood that this would be a used computer not in perfect condition  but this fell short of what i think can reasonably be called good quality used refurbished good computer no manualreceived by a good friend as a gift   shopping was timely and in good condition  only thing was there was no operations or tech manual included to help with set up or anything else too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows    three because i can t be mean  1  despite being well bundled  one screen was damaged  2  not a genuine windows  it will not update  too bad  mc is giving free 10 upgrade for windows 7 users  3  no  your kid can t play minecraft  i updated chipset  don t listen to intel auto detect  install public chipset yourself  go through reggedit and make sure it updated  still won t play minecraft  the keyboards  mouse etc were all cheap  as expected  but new  that was nice  no speakers  btw  the graphic card  im assuming onboard  is having issues with a blinking colors  on screen  i had a spare monitor for the broken one  this was a cheap buy  so i expected issues  the internet is having issue  i m still in process of resolving wireless connectivity  keep in mind  these are not new computers  another issue is roms  they stay stuck on running  both did that when installing wireless software  i don t plan on using rom once net works anyway   these were for kids and so for the money they ll do  even if monitor was damaged and i replaced  returning is more trouble than it id worth  three starsif it workedthree starsi liked it but i wish the screen was nt so oldthree starsit s okay not everything the  tower  arrived but never received the screen or the keyboard mouse  for now i m satisfied with the tower and its overall performance three starsit works the computer arrived on time

don t waste your time  for a hundred or two more you will be much happier not overly happyi guess you get what you paid for  the computer is scratched up and good use for kids games but stopped working after the second week    i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yetthe computer is everything that was advertised  i just can t give a better description because i haven t used it yet three starsok i guess three starsit worksvery satisfiedit is almost everything you want in a desktop   doesn t have video playback  doesn t have wifi and it doesn t have good speakers but besides those three things  i believe i made a good purchase  it was worth it   three starspretty good for normal usagefortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protectionthe system is much slower than i hoped would be the case and upon setup was very susceptible to to viruses  fortunately i got it set up and added mcafee protection  i am very disappointed with the overall speed however it is working more or less good  but lacks too many programsit is working more or less good  but lacks too many programs  i am working on it  but i am not satisfied  the add says that it is a  complete      computer    which is not    amazon still is excellent for me  i will buy always with you  but next time i ll check very thorougly the item or items i like to buy  sincerely  diana but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts    i m finding that the system is slow and not all that i wished it was  i bought a used computer  but i thought that the internet would run much better  i ve been receiving e mail alerts and other alerts that my system is being hacked  i was conned into buying a three year license  because the representative from got support said that it was necessary  guess what  my cable provider told me that i was conned  i m not a happy camper right now  i guess you have to learn what s is good and what isn t  i got my moneys worth from the dell computer  but having these hackers invade my privacy is very annoying  the epson wf 2630 printer is costing me a fortune  i really can t afford this system  with the problems with the ink and the hackers getting into my computer  please excuse me  none of this is amazon s problem  it s mine for being so uneducated about computers  i m sorry about getting an attitude  but i ve waited a long time to get a computer  i had no idea that they could be so complicated  have a good day and god bless windows xp the picture clearly has windows xp running    that might be confusing people because windows xp is very old    please update your pictures  they product tag says windows 7so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says    so far so good started right up only complaint is that it says my window 10 key is not valid so i have to pay for it but the computer does work as it should i have had it now for almost a week and have been using it daily a couple of issues     but otherwise a good computeri ran into a couple of snaffu s with this desktop  side note   i am techno retard  so please excuse my lack of expert terminology   i have a 27  hp monitor that i wanted to use my hdmi cable for optimal picture viewing  but this desktop does not come with an hdmi port   no kidding  look at the pictures   you can use your old school vga monitor cable  but if your monitor supports hdmi  don t expect to have hdmi functionality right of the bat  i did some research and to solve this issue  i bought a displayport to hdmi adapter and connected it to the tiny  unlabeled  illuminated d p port on the back of the computer  my monitor now supports hdmi quality picture  https   www amazon com gp product b017q8zvwk ref oh aui detailpage o03 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 another issue i encountered was slow internet speeds  my desktop came with a 802 11n wireless chip adapter already plugged into one of the back usb ports  i ran an online speed test and wasn t picking up more than 2 mbps  very slow  to solve this issue  i connected an ethernet cable directly to my modem from my desktop and am now picking up 35  mbps  i know this stuff may seem obvious as you re reading it  but it took me a while to figure this stuff out on my own without any help from dell  finally  one other thing  the video graphics card is pretty sub par  i tried playing guild wars 2 and it s incredibly slow choppy   to be fair  there are reviews on here stating this is not a gaming computer  just had to find out the hard way  i guess   actually  if you re reading this  is it possible to upgrade the graphics card in this desktop to make it gaming compatible   one other thing  don t get confused with  it comes pre installed with windows 10   if you re like me  perhaps you thought it would come pre installed with microsoft office  but it does not  i guess i really need to brush up on my computer lingo     overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player    overall the operating system is working great  i had to replace the dvd blue ray player because it was broken internally  after replacing it seems to work ok  the casing was a little beat up but  that s what you get for refurbished three starsgenerally like dell  ended up buying a dell computer  but this tower just did not work out for meon the fence about performancejust got everything setup and wanted to write a review  packaging was good  pc worked right out the box but since plugging it in  i ve noticed several issues 1  it s not quiet  i keep hearing a clicking noise 2  moves very slow  even before i attempted to download any software 3  screen blacks out and shuts entire internet session down  i ve never purchased a certified refurbished pc but so far not good  i love that is comes with windows though good bang for your buckgood bang for your buck  daughter can t play minecraft bc of integrated gpu  case isn t standard size limited upgradeability   great web browser three starsa bit slower than i expected fast response  other concerns my dell optiplex   it s a great little machine i loved it    great to play very fast response on clicking actions  but  for some odd reason it glitched on me  so now when i attempt to power it on  it doesn t turn on  only the  3 4  numbers light up on the front the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever hadwindows 10 is all new to me  hard for me to adjust and learn  the unit seems to be fine  however its the slowest computer i ve ever had  i need to follow up to find out why the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have    the problem is the computer randomly reboots  i have updated everything and i done all of the troubleshooting and it still randomly reboots  i have no idea why not bad okay so far  two things that future buyers need to be aware of  one  the pc i received did not work with wifi nor could i set it up  had to use a direct ethernet connection to the modem two  windows 10 was not preinstalled for upgrade from windows 7  had to download from microsoft directly  also  it is only 160 gb hard drive  but after win10 installation plus a few others i still had enough space leftover  a little  buggy  at first when trying to set up virus protection and scanning  etc  but after a few days all is working efficiently  not bad too mu8ch space used up by windows 10 too mu8ch space used up by windows 10  should have left the space open to the user not the person who gets the kick back from the advertisersgreat for it s priceit s not too bad but  it s not compatible with many things that i would like to do on it    it s lasting me long enough until i can get a new one  and it s a lot better than the one i used before this  it s a little under priced though  a  100 pc should be a lot worse than how it is now
nice but    i love all but one thing about this computer  the screen  perhaps because it is a touch screen  which i don t use  there is so much glare on this screen that in broad daylight i can hardly see read the screen  in other words  it s pretty useless for daytime use  iand i work from home in the daytime  i can t see the cursor most of the time and squint to read the text    horrible  so i need to get an anti glare screen  have you seen the price for those    80     so that significantly impacts the price of the overall unit  if not for this issue  i would give the computer 5 stars  as it is i contemplated three stars    but everything else is great  and i have to say  since i am here    i simply don t get what all the fuss about windows 8 is  i am a techno slouch  in my early fifties and have always had it staff  not computer savvy at all  but i find 8 easy  intuitive    the best operating program i ve experienced  and i agree with other reviews i have seen  windows is an operating system  don t ding the computer itself for that  do ding it hard on the screen though windows8 is a challenge  but the machine is workingi have had no mechanical problems with the 2020 so far  i am not yet comfortable with windows8  but i can t really blame that on dell  they did give a tutorial about windows8  but it was more of an overview than a nuts and bolts teaching tool works wellwindows 7 is a requirements for most of my customers as windows 8 conles with ie 10 that has issues with gm applicationsnice for work  but if you want to add a video card for games get a different systemthis is a nice systems  descent cpu  8 gb of ram  new genetic mouse and keyboard  clean inside  so it was cleaned  two pci express slots  one pci slot and one expressx1 slot  room for a second hard drive  although unless they are hidden in the case some where  you ll have found mounting the drive without the hard drive screws  power supply is small  low wattage  so no way to run like a gtx 1080 video card  and mine came with a 500 fb seagate hard drive from 2008  really a nine year old drive  i don t think this hp came out nine years ago  i m making this an untangle security appliance  so i popped in a 256gb ssd drive a dual nic and installed without any trouble  if the drive had been newer and you could upgrade the power supply  i would of given it 5 stars  but a 8 year old seagate won t last a year    so plan on replacing the hard drive  one very nice touch  they included a burned copy of a windows 10 recovery disc  that was nice  so reinstalling on a new drive should be easy good basic computergood basic computer which started right up  i had difficulty getting windows 10 registered because i didnt realize that the gray shaded area over the key had to be scratched off  i thought it was the sticker above it so got many error codes before i finally got it right  pure user error  after installing a wifi adapter  i was able to get right on line and to get it properly set up   this computer arrived well packaged and with no signs of wear  there was a cable  mouse and wired keyboard included  all standard but new and usable  we are very satisfied with this purchase  it has all the basics and seems to be fast  will see how reliable it is hard to beat it at this price solid deal for the price  would have gave 5 stars had the 8 gigs of ram had been on 1 or 2 sticks  not 4 sticks of 2 gigs  plenty of usb ports  ther eis no hdmi out on this pc  but it does have display port and vga  it is a sff machine but there is a spare 3 5  hdd bay along with spare sata connectors   215 for a 3rd gen i5 with win 10 that should handle most home users needs great for the priceordered 3  unpacked 2 so far  great price  great machines for workstations  one has a dim video card but for the price i m sure i can fix that  just ordered 4 more  great for the price actually now have a total of 7 they are all good machines although 3 had the covers jammed on incorrectly and had to be pried off the machines in order to change out the drive  threw in 250gb ssd in each of them and they are far superior to my old workstations and my employees are like kids at christmas   great machine  well worth the price nice fast machine  scores over 750 on the novabench test  good cpu  plenty of ram  only twist was mine was shipped from canada  and i had to re set some things like time and calendar display  came with a wireless keyboard and mouse  but i never got them to work reliably  oh  and no hdmi output quality computing at a reasonable price i have ordered two of these from two different sellers  skytech usa and microbee   they both had the same specs and both were delivered quickly  both were in pretty good shape physically  a locking tab on the back of the case was bent on both of them but it was easily bent back with a pair of pliers  both run well and perform as expected  both were well packed with either foam packing or plastic bubble wrap protecting them in a quality cardboard box  both came with keyboards  mice  and power cables  both came with windows 10 installed and oem license key stickers on the cases   but i didnt even boot them up before i reloaded them with ubuntu linux  ubuntu found all drivers and installed without any hick ups except for a warning message during the install that uefi was detected and previously installed operating systems may not boot if it was enabled   no big deal for me since i was wiping the whole hard drive during the install  there were two main differences    skytech came with 2 4gb sticks of ram where microbee came with 2 2gb sticks of ram    skytech had no cosmetic changes to the case where microbee had spray painted the metal case black  plastic cover was unaltered   i dont mind the paint that microbee put on the case   it was actually a nice touch in case there was any damaged paint on the case   but they could have done a better job masking the factory hp stickers  there is quite a bit of over spray on the stickers making it obvious it had been re painted  anyone looking at these computers   remember they are not high performance gaming machines  these are business class machines that are a few years old  they are great for web browsing  desktop publishing  email  light gaming  watching videos  etc  i will probably buy a few more of these to use as nas file servers and development web database servers to test with before things go into a much more expensive production environment great computer after bad ram fixed it s a risk buying something used  but it has worked out for me  so far at least    i m happy and i d give it 5 stars except it arrived with defective ram    vendor sent me new ram eventually  but it wasted my time  so for about  200  and my time  i now have a relatively modern computer with 8 gb ram  some usb3 ports  and more usb2 ports   the usb ports are stacked closely together in such a way that there would a collision between some  dongle  type usb devices  even some usb disk keys   fortunately for me i m not using any like that  it s fan noise is fairly quiet  i like to have it standing up which means that the cd drive is sideways  but i m still able to get it to load cds with a little care  i replaced the disk drive it came with with a  150 samsung 500 gb solid disk drive which does wonders for performance  i was hoping to reuse  from a previous computer  some pcie cards that provided extra usb ports  but they required power from a floppy disk power cable which this does not have  i settle for using an external usb hub  for my slower usb devices    i could have purchased a sata power to floppy power adapter  plus perhaps a sata power splitter    would voltages be correct    it has bays for two 3 5  disk drives  and power  but would need to buy an additional sata cable to add a second disk drive  in the front it has cd dvd drive  an unused slot that could accomodate a card reader     4 usb2 ports  speaker and microphone jacks  and a power button that is really hard to see in dim light  in the back it has 4 usb3 ports  2 usb2 ports  vga port  displayport 1 1a  ps2 keyboard port  ps2 mouse port  serial port  ethernet port  speaker and microphone jacks  2 pcie x16  1 pcie x  1 pci slots windows 10 system at a good pricei ve purchaced refurbished hp systems before and so far all are still doing well  this system is a great price for its specs and the fact that it contains win 10  it had some damage on the back inside case  bent metal from a previous hit  but no exterior damage and the system fired up with little issue  you will have to activate the install of 10 but the company provides a well written set of instructions for this procedure  the outer case is covered with a decal skin that covers any scratches  i like it  i will be contacting the company again for more of these systems remember   not a new machineitem is a computer with specifications as described  delivered a day early with good packaging  the windows 10 license is legit and microsoft sticker on outside of pc  machine arrived totally functional  and windows activated flawlessly  for the price  a fair deal  two things i wasn t expecting   first  the hard drive is loud and sounds awful  not a constant whine like bearings are going  but a harsh noise when accessed  with occasional hammering that sounds like potential seek errors  installed smart utility  tests fine but i will replace at earliest opportunity  so keep in mind you are getting a refurbished machine  but potentially a pretty old hard drive  second  this particular machine has two beefy fans  for the system power supply and for the cpu  both are fairly noisy and vibrate the case  if your office is quiet  this should liven things up quite a bit  not sure what i can do about that  i ll check and see how easy the fans are to replace   again  with a machine with some age on it  fans have bearings and don t last forever     product is tested and certified to look and work like new    it certainly doesn t look  newwhile the product page states  this certified refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new   it certainly doesn t look  new   the case is beat up and the product key was damaged  it came torn and taped together missing the middle 5 characters   but once the product key issue was resolved  it seems to work great bios   power supplygreat packing  the computer housing looked brand new     ok i un boxed it and plugged everything in hit the power button and nothing   i read the reviews and they said bad power cord and sure enough thats what it was  replaced it and it worked  the problem i had was when i left a usb external hard drive plugged into the computer it would not boot up  lucky for me i bought a usb hub that had on and off switches or i would have to un plug and plug in every time  customer support was very nice but it did not solve the problem  for me it is not a problem i can build them and the price of building one is much more then the price of this one  i think it is one of two things  the power supply cant handle the boot up mode meaning  drawing to much power  hard drives plugged in  usb  it wont boot   its a very small power supply   two  bios  i thought maybe when they installed an operating system they used a usb flash drive to install it the computer was acting like it was trying to boot from there  so i went into the bios of the computer everything was set right so it needs a bios update or bigger power supply  i use it to go online play some videos thats about it its very fast and in that respect it works great for the price   food for thought  refurbished not sure you can go wrong   its still too early to say if this is 5 stars  but there is no doubt that for a daily computer that is going to be used for surfing the net  writing emails  and some basic microsoft office  there isn t a better way to go  i have only had for a week but it looks great  functions perfectly  so far   and there was no smell as some reviewers have talked about  it works well enought that i ordered a second one today  for my wifes home office  will update in the future and possibly increase the rating it s nice to get a little more room at the work    it s nice to get a little more room at the work station  i don t do anything heavy duty  just music conversions  emails and face book  this serves my purposes very nicely  i was actually hoping for it to come with windows 7 but that didn t happen  oh well  when i first fired it up it was a little noisy but with it in the horizontal position  it did eventually quiet down nicely  it s pretty fast  noticeably quicker than my last computer  by the way  the last on just decided to not work anymore  i did manage to get it working long enough to print out my contacts list from my palm pda program before it died again  of coarse like the last windows 10  this computer won t talk to my palm either so it s all manually input and the hand held never gets updated to fully match the computer  i wish my smart phone was as easy to use as my old palm tx  i would buy this again and i recommend it too this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet this machine is plenty fast for folks who just need to use office and the internet  it s not for gamers or professional video editors  my only dislike is the small form factor  i can t use my old television pci card because it s too tall old bios   won t upgrade windows 10 note   this is not configured to run windows 10  it does come with and manages to run the early versions of windows 10 build 1703  microsoft and hp customer support told me it could no longer run auto updates for windows 10 because of an old bios that should not be updated  both companies said to leave it as it is and just stop updates and live on the early win 10 build  it is a great machine and runs the early win 10 version well but be aware   this machine is now strictly for older software  on the hp site it will tell you that it is not configured t run win 10  so buy it but beware of this limitation of an older machine add ssd for os  programs  and bootingproduct arrived on time  it was well packaged with plenty of padding  included within was a power cable  new usb mouse  and a new usb keyboard  initial speed was lagging  performed a virus and malware check with bitdefender   no problems  analyzed system with iolos system mechanic professional and found some file frags  windows file remnants  and a couple of registry problems  along with some unnecessary start up programs  let program repair all these  boot up sped up considerably  removed cover  latch was uncooperative and adjusted incorrectly   computer reeked of curry  took 3 full days of airing out with cover removed and warming up interior to hasten smell removal  i cloned hdd to crucial ssd 250gb  reset to boot off ssd  using ssd for all os  programs  and apps  hdd for all

ready to go  register windows and you are all set make sure you activate windows 10when you get the machine  make sure you activate windows 10 using the product key found on the 4 color sticker on the side of the machine great i got this for less than 200 on amazon  upgraded with a new ssd and logitech keyboard and mouse  dual monitor set up with the display port and vga output  for office task  ms word  excel  outlook and quickbook  etc     this is a beast  aesthetically  for a refurbished unit  looks barely used  some minor scratches  not very noticeable  i did have a noise issue with the fan  like the other reviewers mentioned  it went away for now  i will report back if this problem comes back  great value  buy with confidence great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you    great value just gotta roll the dice and hope you get a good one like i did  mine looked brand new like it had been sitting in a office but never was used  everything was nice and shiny and no dust whatsoever  works great with the gtx 1050ti low profile graphics card runs anygame i throw at it at ultra settings     its awesome never drop below 30 fps  dont expect to use this computer for more than 5 years but it will work until 2020 at least with that graphics card disappointedoriginally i was very disappointed  there were several things that did not work  however in contacting amazon they connected me with a tech who walked me thru the whole thing and i was able to get it up and running  a little inconvenient  but hey  the worlds not perfect and neither am i    thanks amazona business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard    i ordered three  two had defective dvd drives  but i had two replacements within a week that worked  i ve been assured that my future orders will confirm that all works  i will give them another chance  a business class computer for just over 200 bucks is a good bargain  note that i did install new hard drives  though  cloning the five year old drives that came with them  still a good bargain good system for the moneygood system for the money   so far   time will tell just how well it was refurbished  my wife is happy with it  the i5 with 8 gig does what she needs it to  and then some  this company did what they said they would power cord wasn t as good  too sensitive  other than that it ran smoothly the power cord didn t work that great and it was very sensitive  luckily i had an extra power cord from my xbox 360 to use it on this computer  other than that  the computer runs like its almost brand new  it can run games like world of tanks and arma 2 smoothly but not on high graphics just in case you plan on getting a computer to play games on  it also has a reliable windows defender to protect you from viruses that make an attempt to enter your computer easily powers my home media center for kodidecent pc for what it is  easily powers my home media center for kodi  has a problem booting with an external drive attached  even though i ve disabled the settings in the bios a nice inexpensive quad core computergot this as a christmas gift for my father  basically it was the only one with adequate features at a price i could afford  he needed my brother to set it up for him and it was only done so about 3 weeks ago  so far it has worked well  only real problem is the dvd drive is read only  but as i said  it s the best i could afford  so my dad will have to make do solid  fast pc    bum tech supportthe computer is great  this is the least i ve spent on a desktop and the best one i ve owned  i would say that the mouse they sent me did not work and they are terrible about getting back to me as far as support goes  i bought a mouse at walmart and all is well  overall it s been a couple days and i am very pleased for the price it was a good purchase for usworks as advertised  it came with a boatload of bloatware  but we had that removed with little effort  for the price it was a good purchase for us good starter computer that can be upgraded this was a gift for my son  he s 13  and this is a great starter for him to build on  he s already used his allowance to increase the ram and buy an external hard drive nice quiet desktop with good performance and a great pricei bought this as refurbished  the unit is very quiet  graphics are good enough for my wife to use as a business machine and she is happy with the startup performance and running word  excel  mail and so on  windows 10 professional is running on it just fine its pretty good its not too hard to set up and use  i wish it had a microphone for alexa  i am having a problem with the number 1 on the keyboard already  all in all though  its better than i expected  i m pretty happy with it looks like it had never been usedpackaged well  looks like it had never been used  started right up with windows 10 pro  works very well with everything i need a pc for  i would buy again this computer is great for the moneythis computer is great for the money  inside is clean and easy to get to  took the average amount of time to load up and register everything  only thing is no wi fi  i purchased a sub wi fi device and it gets better signal than the old computer so  yay  powerhouse for under 200 00  definitly the sweet stop on price vs performance worth the money even though it was a refurbish i purchased two of these  one from my mother and another for myself  both set up easily although mine has a glitch in boot up that delays start time  i was worried about how secure a side mounted cd dvd would hold the disc but there are little notches to keep the disc secure  this is a decent purchase it s a great system  but it did not come with windows    it s a great system  but it did not come with windows 10 like it advertised  it came with windows 7 professional  and when i talked to customer service    my choice was either to stick with it   or ship the system back  so i kept it the way it is good valuenice little box for the price  no room to do any upgrades  so plan on keeping it a basic pc after that there were no issues and functions great since some minor issues when during initial set up  after that there were no issues and functions great since great machine very competent for multitaskinggreat machine very competent for multitasking  running videostreams on 2 browsers simultanously finally able to utilize w  10 w o any issuesfour starsgreat pc  with the addition of a graphics card im using it as a gaming pc missing mouse and keyboard but the desktop is greatit is an excellent product for the price  it works great and i repurposed my asus pci wireless network card  from old desktop  and installed on it for wi fi  only complaint is that the seller didn t include the keyboard and mouse like mentioned in the product description no hdmiworks great  did not have hdmi  i am ordering more with hdmigood seller  unfortunately defective productseemed to be a nice computer  unfortunately it failed due to a defect  the staff at bt was courteous and professional in attempting to resolve the issue  unfortunately it was determined over the phone that my machine was defective and it was returned quickly and easily for a full refund  too bad  it performed well  until it didn t  thank you bt goodworks well  the only reason i gave it four stars is because i had to re enter the windows product key  also the case had a few more stickers than i would have liked to have seen woyld buy again i can t say anything bad about the refurbishing job that was done  everything worked as expected out of the box the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise older style of hdmi port so had to get an adapter  otherwise  the tower was exactly what i expected  the seller even included a keyboard and mouse which was not expected but a nice surprise nice unit   fast and plenty of front facing usb ports up and running   a bit of a scare when it started scrolling at high speed when booting up  had to shut it down a couple of times  problem resolved itself without further ado   thank god four starsso far so goodsurprise  came a day early   this computer is meant to supplement my mac for cross platform development  it is reasonably fast with win 10 pro 64 and came a day earlier than promised  packed well with good instructions  very little bloatware  i would give it 5 stars  but i am a mac guy and it just goes against my grain good performance for an older computerthe hp 8300 is used for accessing the internet and it does a good job  the only deficiency is that it does not have a memory card port i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one    i am currently satisfied with my purchase but i am holding back one star as i do not know how it will perform in the long haul it shuts downeverything seems to be great so far except it powers off it the tower is moved    like if my desk is bumped or my knee slightly bumps the tower it completely shuts downgood pc for the pricegood pc for the pricebeen using this for a few months now  have    been using this for a few months now  have not came across any issues with this pc  definetly worth the money  stuck a gtx 1050 in it and can handle everthing i need it for  totally reccomend four starsgood value but keyboard and mouse rejected for bettergood purchase good purchase  six months and no problems  runs like a champ four starsi like the slim design  so far i have found nothing wrong with it almost perfect   i would have given this desktop 5 stars if it hadn t had a problem with booting up  but all i had to do was look up the error and how to fix it  and it was perfectly fine  i recommend this to anyone who needs a computer faster than a laptop for work works great as advertised  i did get the warranty   i think that makes a difference in what you get  works great watch out for win 10 registration number cannot seem to get windows registration to work and no call back as of yet four starsgreat product  good price  fast shipping four starsafter some updating it works well product looks clean and nice i received the product in nice condition with keyboard and mouse  mouse was cracked but emailed the customer service and they shipped the replacement immediately  overall i am happy with the purchase and it came with windows 10 64 bit  running vm and ubuntu without any issue so far shipping was on time with good packing  pc worked goodshipping was on time with good packing  pc worked good quiet

occupied with 2gb ram  attached an sdd under the optical drive but needed the 3 5inch case and sata wire  also no wifi link adapter so requires one  all in all pretty good for the price four starsworks like a charm so far  very pleased with our purchase buy with confidence the computer broke within two months of use  contacted the seller after the memory failed and the seller went above and beyond to replace the unit  buy with confidence great gaming pc for the price  medium range really great computer  runs good  awesome specs for the price  if your looking for a medium range gaming pc then this ones for you  the only downside is it doesnt come with a vga cable  mine came with a generic mouse  and keyboard    me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly    got to me on time with windows 10 mouse and keyboard great condition only thing is it that it restarts randomly so one star gonei love this deali love this deal  it is amazing as i was on a very tight budget when i purchased this  however  the only downside is that you can find them for much cheaper on ebay but maybe missing windows  which is only  30  besides that  it has worked well for my internet browsing and schoolwork needs the computer hardware is okay the computer hardware is okay  however windows 10 is not intuitive and continues to try and over ride my google apps preferencesa good upgrade from my old windows vista machineworks well  a good upgrade from my old windows vista machine  still getting used to windows 10  some things i like  some not  the computer itself functions well everything works great with iteverything works great with it  however the fan is considerable loud  it doesn t bother me though  not for the price     im very satisfied runs great  good valuequick shipping  runs great  good value  one issue  the computer console had a big dent on one side  not from shipping  as it was well encased in styrofoam and box had zero damage but other than that it has been working good didn t have wi fi built in  also didn t have enough correct ports for my monitor  but other than that it has been working good so far so

packed well looks newall worked great  packed well looks new  only complaint is an excessively loud cooling fan  so much so im ordering replacement fan four starslow price and it worksfour starseverything is as advertised no  have had nothing but problems with this pc  i will never purchase another refurbished electronic devicegood value for the price liked the price  it was easy to set up  works very well  windows activation was also easy four starsgoodmine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10    mine came with windows 7 pro  wanted windows 10 pro but can deal with this  there were 186 updates needed to fully update this machine plus it came with ie 8 so i had to update this as well to ie11  purchased 7 of these to use in the non profit organization i work with  which is why i was willing to go refurbished  had 4 days as of this post and all is well  gave the 4 stars just because of the 3 hours i put in to update and install the 3 programs i use  15 min for these 3 programs   if was already set up and activated with a lot fewer updates  then 5 stars  it performs as advertises and no other problems  it is a definite computer if you want something cheap  one last pet peeve  i don t consider this as a sff machine  small form factor  as the case is almost full size four starsbought multiple units and has served us well for the most partcan t beat the price  runs greatarrived in 5 days west to east coast  seller gave us auto upgrade from 745 to 755  has a duel core  2gb ram we updated to 4gb today  has a dvd burner  plays video and games no problem  monitor was damaged from shipping we suspect  computer itself looks very used but runs great  keyboard  mouse are cheapie and used  item was listed as  like new  but looks very used all around  no speakers  just internal on board sound speaker so you will want to buy external speakers for sure and a usb wifi adapter also as it comes without that too  for the price it is worth it not perfect but   the delivery speed was awesome coming before the first estimated date of delivery without the speakers which arrived separately about a week later  for the most part its good for the price but the disk drive doesn t work as i bought this computer partly to watch dvds i was disappointed but i couldn t afford to return it to be replaced and be without a computer for another two weeks and all the programs i needed had on line downloads  also expect to have to buy a wifi connector they are cheaper on amazon than in store  i will be getting another computer when i have the money but this one is a good stop gap until then system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was    system is working fine only problem was the cpu body the frame was cracked and doesnt sit properly on cpu  but as a whole set system works perfectlyperfect purchasehave had it for almost a year now  i use it for my music studio  i have another monitor and tv connected to it  its perfect  runs great  only thing i would say is avoid getting a modem and or router for this computer because it will not work  the signal will not get picked up  i recommend a wifi usb adapter  it works great for computers like this one cool but  so far so good    but     it cuts off at times  i will be notifying the owner overall nice thogood value a good used computer  i had to have them send me another monitor as the first one was somewhat defective  wouldn t turn off   they were quick and helpful to replace it dell computersthe whole set up for  125  you can not beat it  i bought a usb for wifi and all set  easy instructions and set up  a little plastic damage on the corner  other than that  its great good value for the moneyhuge monitor  crystal clear resolution  not a genuine copy of windows 7  though  i would buy from this company again  good value for the money the computer came in good condition and also work greatthe computer came in good condition and also work great  the only hangup was that the keyboard that came with it didn t work and i had to go out and buy another keyboard and also had to go out and buy an ethernet cord that supports the monitor  other than those things the computer runs really well and have no complaints four starsvery nice computer for the price  runs a little slow but that may just be my wifinice very nice  runs a bit slower then had hoped  but overall looks new and clean  the screens resolution isn t great buy that s always replaceable     was broke off but other than thst its a good deal only thing wrong with mines i got was a couple of the keys on the keyboard was broke off but other than thst its a good deal   broken keyboard when openedkeyboard came busted  bought a wireless to replace  no big del  computer awesome  it will be great for school in augustit works like newbought as a gift  grandkids love it good buy for the price   i purchased this computer refurbished from the seller linked pc inc  straight out of the box this computer was easy to set up with some very minor and self explanatory assembly required on the monitor    this is my first desktop computer  having come from a generation mostly dominated by laptops  but found that this system was easy to set up  plug in  etc  again  very self explanatory    there was some minor damage on the back of the housing on the computer tower  but as it does not affect the computer s functionality or appearance  as it is located on the back  i am not too bothered with it  i got what i paid for  a used  somewhat battered  refurbished pc    there were other signs of reasonable wear and tear on the computer  further indicating to me that it was indeed used and refurbished    none of these reasons are the reason for my one deducted star  i chose to deduct one star because the keyboard is frustratingly dirty  several of the keys seem to stick a bit as if it is dirty and was not cleaned properly    i ll clean it up of course  it s not a huge enough issue to contact the seller and whine about it  but i do feel that it s a flaw on their customer service abilities  it would have been nice to receive a computer that was at least free of other people s dirt  i have my own dirt to clean  i don t really appreciate being given more    just a principle thing  i suppose    aside from that  it started up beautifully  quickly set up the os and allowed me to name and personalize the computer and os in a way i ve never seen on a refurbished computer    i do recommend buying from this or other sellers who are certified microsoft refurbishes because they guarantee an authentic operating system without any crap and bloatware to bog down your system  which i have experienced and been frustrated by with other sellers of other computers    regardless of the few little flaws  i would recommend this computer to a prospective buyer  for the price i don t think it can be beat    happy shopping decent computer for a good price sometimes it takes long to start up  my advice is to give it some time in advance to let computer load up  5min  before using then computer works good  this computer is ideal for simple task as like school work  paying bills also for entertainment  youtube  google ext    great computer i was happy to receive this a day early but the only problem was that the description said that it comes with a 19  monitor but what i got was a 17  monitor  i only gave this product such a high rating because they were so willing to send me a 19  monitor and let me keep the 17  monitor for my troubles     no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and    for gaming this is a no no but other than that this is a great desktop  i installed windows ten onto it and it runs very smoothly  too bad i couldnt download counter strike on it though witch was the only reason that i wanted it lolgood computer but keyboard damagedall in all the computer is fine and as i had expected  however  the keyboard that came with it is cracked which may have occurred in shipping but nevertheless cracked and a piece fell off it was easy to set upi was please with the computer   it was easy to set up  it is well worth what i paid for it can t beat the price for the product you re getting i bought this for my wife and thus far she loves it  there were some upgrades made to it bye the shipper that were a pleasant surprise  if you want a budget priced desktop this fits the bill four starsafter the third hard drive it is working fine hope it will be fine from now onomgim on this computer right now lol i love it and it was fairly cheap to get a nice onefour starsgreat product only on amazonfor the price we will be back   best deal on amazon   four starsall that for under  100good system for the

that it was not set to 230v and it blew up ok computergood computer the monitor sucks but if you have another one it looks perfect keyboard is cheapfour starsgood for video streaming and normal internet browsing  but it runs slower after upgrade to windows 10 four starseverything was in excellent condition and is working fine the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunki ve actually received the optiplex 755  the computer looks brand new and works great  i would say this was a slam dunk   love it four starsa little slow but ok for price four starsnice unit i bought  2  of these plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive    everything arrived on time and well packaged  plugged it in and everything works great  my only issue is that the disk drive will not open  for me this isn t the biggest issue i m not doing anything serious with this computer  it is mainly for my young daughter to use abc mouse and basically practice using a computer  she s 5   to return it i would need to pay for packaging since i threw out the boxes it came in already  pay for shipping and a 15  restocking fee  so i will keep it as long as no other issue arises  would have given 5 stars if the dd worked properly good deal  works just fineyep works and for the money very nicefour starsneeded a video card to be of use in

four starsvery good   but the speckers sounds cheaper  well worth the money they had a great customer service  they called me and worked with me for about an hour to ensure that i was satisfied  i had to return the monitor because they had sent me one that didn t have the correct connections   i returned it even though it would have worked fine with other computers  it was more costly than the one they should have sent  but i didn t need another monitor and returned it and they credited me for the monitor  good people   and a great customer service works fine  the only thing i had to do was    works fine  the only thing i had to do was buy a  28 part to make it wireless  so far i am very pleased four starssatisfied customergoodit came with win 64 a bonusfour starsis good for the price

beat the pricewell worth the price  i brought this computer for mr 11 year old to help with school work and other things like surfing the web  when i unpack it i was a little concern because the computer had a few dents and some scratches  the monitor had a few scratches  the keyboard looks new and the mouse looks good also  i had to buy a wifi card and a pair of speakers found them both for under 10 dollars on amazon  after setting it up and connecting everything it works great  it also came with a free upgrade four starswas everything i expected four starswork good so far  very satisfied four starsi have been very pleased so far four starsworks fine as shouldfour starsquick delivery great computerworth the money  but not quite good as newif i were evaluating this against a standard desktop computer  i would give it less than 4 stars  but for the price  this is a pretty good machine  it s not without its issues  even after purchasing and installing additional memory  i still get frequent low memory warnings that force me to close my browser  and every time i turn the computer on i get the following message   this version of audio esp is not intended for this operating system   i just x the message out and it doesn t seem to have any effect on the computer or sound  so it s more a nuisance than anything else  but it does seem like something that should have been taken care of before the computer was shipped out  the monitor  keyboard and mouse are all very nice quality and work great  i especially love that the monitor is adjustable in height  if your monitor arrives locked in the lowest position like mine was and won t slide up  just push it down a bit and the lock will release and let you slide it up to your preferred height   the tower has a couple of dings and scratches  but they are only cosmetic and don t appear to affect performance  at least as far as i can tell   the speakers were terrible  they were flimsy and produced a constant crackling noise like a radio with a bad signal  but i figured that they were the least critical piece of hardware  so i wasn t too disappointed  i bought these instead and they work great  amazonbasics usb powered computer speakers  a100    again  my rating is for the value of the product for the price  for a little over  100  this is a great buy  as long as you are not expecting the versatility or performance you d get with a newer  more high end machine  this is definitely worth the money four starsitem lived up to my expectationsfour starsexcellent for the price four starsgreat

starsvery happy  only thing is speakers are scratchy  sound  and the stand broke early on no sound drivehad trouble installing my printer  no up dated drive  monitor is good but a older model  very heavy cpu unit has a few scratches a very older model  came with no speakers bought headphones and still no sound has a cd slot and a floppy drive but no sd card drive  good for the money except for no sound that is the only thing i am disappointed with the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality produce the company responded to me in a timely manner  during shipping the cpr was rather beaten up  causing the harddrive to disconnect  additionally  the computer screen plastic surround was chipped  initially  the technician thought the drive was bad and sent out a new one  when i opened the unit  i learned that the drive was unplugged  the next problem was that i could not connect to the internet  i again contacted the company  after several tries and after speaking with the technician again  i was transferred to sales  the company sent a pick up ticket for the computer with the problems and replaced the unit  we are very pleased with the unit and i certainly would recommend this company  the company went above and beyond to see that we received a quality product that met our needs i received what i was hoping for i m happy to say that i m enjoying this computer and all my doubts have been erased  i would not hesitate to buy another the same way overall happy with itthe computer is very fast  but the mouse doesnt work correctly  overall

are certainly better systems  but for the basics  this is great  had to replace the memory after 3 months  still not a bad deal  but down to 4 stars  the machine appears and operates as if new and is very fast  my only complaint would be that it seemed plagued by a number of outdated drivers  although i had to employ a third party vendor to correct this deficiency  the cost was nominal  and overall i am very pleased with the purchase and consider it a wise investment had to purchase a new key board as my old    had to purchase a new key board as my old one had an out dated connection end  no big deal as key boards are really cheap nice computercomputer works well  i don t like windows 10 and seem to be having problems with the email app disappearing but the computer is good four

four starsworking well so far and i been happy with it four starsso far it works fine four starsseems finefour starsso far so good everything as advertised recommended to friendsthe windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set upit is a fast running computer  the windows 10 works excellent  it just takes a while to set up  the start up is the same as any other windows version computer  i bought mine for an excellent price around  95 and it is worth every bit of it  i have had it for two months and use it everyday to do basic computer work and some school studies  it is wifi compatible but they send an antenna with it to pick up the wifi service and the wifi does not work on this device without out it  also there is no bluetooth  so you also have to buy separately a bluetooth transmitter  the wifi antenna they sent with it stopped working with this after a week and i made dozens of calls to local computer servicing businesses and they did not know why so i spent  15 to buy a new one which was very aggravating  also the windows office products do not come with this device so you have to purchase them separately for like  99  it has numerous little bugs and fixes but just for an at home pc to do some work on it works fine  not highly recommended otherwise  my best advise is to do your research and find out exactly what you need and are looking for    don t go wrong with a machine like this cause it can just become a money drain like it has for me  fan is loud  gets hotgets really hot and fan becomes very loud  not on floor or against surfaces blocking vents  works well otherwise four starsthe sound quality is not so goodfour starsperhaps it is my internet connection  but sometimes slow
wonderful machinethe new dell touch screen computer is wonderful  it takes a little time to get use to  but once you learn how you will never go back great computer love this computer  i am disabled both in eyes and hands  and the large touchscreen is a real asset  i live in a nursing home  so the all in one style is compact  and i easily found space for it  i did get a faulty power cord  but dell sent a tech out the next day  no problems since that  i would definitely recommend this desktop good computermost excellent computer for the money  we are using these with windows 8 then realized how much better windows 8 1 is  definitely plan on several hours to upgrade the operating system five starsoklooks goodjust opened  looking good  have to learn how to use it so will have lots of question  adding information i had in former computer and so far no problemsfive starsgreat deal  love this producti just purchased mine and have to say it is way neater then i expected  it is easy to use and actually a lot of fun even for an older lady like me   my son could not believe the price on this unit  no big heavy modem   just quick and easy set up best computer i ever boughtmore worth for your money than i expectedafter reading many of the reviews  i had a flash of regret having ordered the refurbished desktop  after 2 days of eager waiting  this was delivered and it left me beaming with satisfaction and relief to find a sealed  that s right sealed  desktop looking barely used and unrecognizable microscopic scratches and strangely smelling new  it was packed with a pretty cool balloon pack  the sellers name is  microbee  and they are microsoft certified refurbished  they also added in a brand new keyboard and mouse  although i plan to use my existing logitech keyboard which i m so used to   i plugged it in and windows 10 professional setup almost instantly after i keyed in the product key  to my surprise microsoft office was pre installed  i already have an office 365 account and i could login and access all my old files from the cloud account  the only things i had to purchase extra were an usb wifi adapter  5ghz works on usb 3 0  and a displayport to hdmi cable  now it s all set and i m so happy i bought a refurbished desktop  i m proud that i did my bit to the environment excellent deal   good machine   packed well so  i was in the market for a  new  pc that was modern  but old enough to be have hardware designed for windows 7  been looking at tons of these slightly older business machines and decided i wanted an hp elite 8300  it s a model that is old enough to be compatible with windows 7 without any fuss of finding drivers  but modern enough to be equipped with lots of fast ram  a fast bus  and a fast intel i5 processor with decent graphics  these hp elite machines are well built  fast business grade machines that are perfect for home users that know what they want in a slightly older machine  much better quality hardware than the retail consumer pcs at walmart  best buy etc  it s not a gaming rig   period  and not designed to take a super powered graphics card  but with a clean copy of windows 7 installed  these machines fly and will effortlessly handle any home office browsing tasks you throw at it  and if you enjoy windows 10  these machines will run it smoothly as well  i just don t agree with the way windows 10 works   i wanted a machine specifically to run windows 7  it came with a clean copy of windows 10 installed  along with a coa  but i immediately formatted the hard drive and installed windows 7  windows 10 was not a selling point for me  i bought this pc specifically because it was a high end business grade machine from the windows 7 era  i am a home user and i am sticking with windows 7 until no longer practical to do so  i absolutely hate windows 10 and refuse to ever use it  i nearly cancelled my order after reading reviews about bad packaging  or machines with major damage  but i decided to roll the dice  i m glad i did  the pc was packaged very well and professionally  it is clean inside with only minimal dust build up on the fans and heatsinks  nothing nasty  just light dust  all the usb ports and display port are tight and not worn out  the case is in very good shape with only minor scuffs and scratches on the top where a monitor would sit  the front is clean as new  it was shipped with the usual brand new imicro brand cheapy keyboard and mouse that most refurbished systems come with  along with a power cord  these are not top quality keyboards and mice  but they will work just fine if you re not particular like i am  i already have a nice keyboard and mouse  so no big deal there  these are used machines  so i think it s natural to expect some with hardware issues to occasionally slip through quality control  but generally these are a very good bargain for users that know what they are looking for  the one i ended up getting turned out to be a gem  i can t say that your luck will be the same  but mine arrived with 4 matched sticks of 2 gb ram  for a total of 8 gigs as advertised  and a western digital enterprise grade 500 gb hard drive that surprisingly has lower power on hours according to the smart data  glad i bought it  i m thrilled the perfect ultra cheap gaming pcthere are a lot of reviews and answered questions saying this pc can t be used for gaming  but that s simply not true  this hp elite 8300 arrived in like new condition with a brand new hard drive  new ram  and an unused windows 10 key  and i was able to slot in a low profile geforce 1050 video card that s so far been able to run every game i ve thrown at it in 1080p with max settings  including skyrim  gtav  the witness  counter strike global offensive  and others  it s a perfectly zippy computer on its own  but dropping in a decent graphics card  it appears the 1050 ti is the most this system can handle  particularly with regard to its proprietary 240 watt power supply  has given me a system that well exceeds my expectations and runs video games better than any other device i ve owned  including my past computers and home consoles  i did have one minor issue with the system when it arrived  the fan on the power supply made a curious grinding noise that sounded like it was going out  to fix it  i slid a screwdriver into the back of the power supply to stop the fan from spinning  then started the computer  after a few moments  i pulled the screwdriver out  and the fan sped up to its max speed  likely in an attempt to rapidly cool the system  after spinning at such high speed  the fan stopped making the noise at lower speeds  and i haven t heard the grinding noise nor heard the fan spin up to its highest speed since  it s been over five months since then  and i haven t had a single issue to report otherwise  it s also worth noting that the computer shipped in a box indicating that it was a microsoft certified refurbished system  this isn t  or wasn t  listed in the product description  but for some users  this certification is added peace of mind  edit  ten months have passed since i first started using this pc  and nearly everything is still working perfectly  i say  nearly  because after months of ignoring the system s front facing headset port  i finally plugged one in only to find that the port doesn t carry microphone audio as indicated  for me  this is no big deal  otherwise  the system has been a treat  i installed a pci wireless network adapter and an lg branded blu ray burner  both of which have been working flawlessly  my 1050 has been also running smoothly with absolutely no problems  to be honest  i ve had fewer problems with this system than any other pc i ve ever owned  granted  most of my others were built from the ground up  my experience has been such a success that i even convinced a buddy of mine to buy his own 8300 several months back  and from what i ve heard  his system has been functioning perfectly as well gaming potato  love it    pair this with a gtx 1050 ti low profile  and i m in business  runs most games i throw at it on ultra  getting it some extra 8gb of pc 12800 for cheap  don t get ecc or registered buffered   make sure it s non ecc non registered ram  for  40 here on amazon and i ve got myself a nice little 3 year proof rig for 350 total  not bad at all  shop carefully for gpus  they are on the hike right now due to bitcoin miners  this machine does not come with wifi or bluetooth  fyi  ethernet only  after putting in a low profile gtx  only the pcie x 1 slot remains open  both full laned pcie s are taken by the video card  keep this in mind when buying a wireless adapter  or go with an usb one  i love my  350 potato it works great  zero problemsi put an msi 1050 low profile graphics card in this machine and have ended up with an impressive  per my standards  and inexpensive gaming computer  it works great  zero problems looks good  works great  no complaints nice pc  clean  works  windows 10 pro activated with no problems  purchased for my mom to browse the internet  play solitaire and non graphic intense games  has decent computing power  new mouse and keyboard  it s everything it was advertised as  was a little worried when i saw the box  but it was a box in a box  the inside box was packaged very well and sealed  pc wrapped and sealed  keyboard and mouse in there respective boxes  500gb wd blue  dvd rom  everything works  i build custom systems for others  high end water cooled gaming units  could not build a system like this for what i payed  excellent deal on price  some of the bad reviews were scaring me  but i trust in amazon to take care of issues if one should arise  purchased the   squaretrade 3 year desktop protection plan for  14   they will fix whatever breaks up to the price i payed for it  that s cheap for another mobo  power supply or hd  any electronics are subject to moisture  power spikes  static  environment  a new product can be bad right out of the box from a weak component  all it takes is 1 transistor in over 3 to 30 million inside of a single chip to fail and bring a device down  worth the insurance great deal  great support from skytech this is an incredible deal   as are many of the other small form factor computers   great quad cpu speed  big disk  usb 3  way faster than almost any laptop  and a much cheaper solution  i actually bought two of them  and am very happy with performance  sometimes you just need a desktop instead of a laptop  one of the power supplies failed after a couple of days  and i called skytech usa support  number is on the info card that came with the computers   it was a great support experience  rather than make me send the whole computer back for what was clear a failing power supply  they offered to simply send a replacement supply after asking if i was comfortable replacing it  no fuss  no questions asked   just an easy fix  the replacement came in a few days  and was trivial to replace  and now all is well  this is how support should be it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for    this desktop looked almost in mint condition and came ready with windows 7 pro pre installed up to where you select language and finish setting it up  so i did have to go through the windows update process  but other than that  it works like it supposed to and was a welcome upgrade for my work computer no complaints so far so good with this purchase  i was a little wary of going with a refurbished unit  but the thing booted up like a charm  i bought this for my stepmother who only utilizes it for facebook and casino games  basically  so she wasn t in need of something crazy powerful  so i can t comment on how it would work for graphics heavy gaming purposes  for those who had problems with the packaging  i must say mine was packed up amazingly well  it was well cushioned with airbags  or whatever the proper name  and wrapped up like fort knox and the outer box remained undamaged  not even a scratch on the case of the unit  i must say you can t tell this thing was refurbished  they even included a mouse and a keyboard  so far i m very satisfied computer arrived like new  unusedcomputer arrived like new  unused  software registration was fast  direct and easy  updates were flawless but took almost 6 hours to get to win 10 build 1709  ram came with 4 slots  2 had 4gb each  2 were empty  added 2 more 4gb sticks of 1600 ddr3 with no problems for 16gb total  added crucial 275gb ssd with no problems  acronis software was extremely easy to clone existing hdd and customer service was prompt and great  removed original hdd with updated win10  build 1709 and put it away in case of a major crash  got a wd  1tb  7200rpm hdd for under 50 00  instead of trying to install it internally  i put it in an  eaxer  external drive container that works on usb 3 0 and labeled it storage drive  this is a great box for 20 00 as it has an on off switch and many other features  saved me from going into the bios and trying to change the boot disk and other settings  i ve had problems working with hp bios systems before and a mistake in the bios setting can cause whole computers to turn all disks into raw files and unreadable  i do a lot of high definition video recording and processing  this machine screams with the upgrades and provides a perfect match for working with large volume real time video  to say i m extremely pleased  would be an understatement  well done skytec and amazon great buymy only complaint  the ram was installed in the wrong slots upon arrival  quick fix and runs like a champ so far so good no damage or issues with any of the hardware  the inside was clean as a whistle  popped a gtx 1050 ti lp in it and now i m downloading games and updating the os with the insider builds  web browsing seems fine  haven t found any issues to speak of so far  anything bad comes up and i will update my review but so far so good  edit  i just so happened to have 8gbs of ram from my old pc to ad to the 8gbs in this machine so now i have 16 gbs of ram and man does it make this thing a gaming beast  some games today do need 16gbs of ram or they stutter  such as cod wwii  able to just about max that out at 1080p 60fps without it ever dipping below that  i tried mkx and came close to max 1080p 60 fps as well  if i maxxed it it would stutter though  it doesn t look any different to me anyways though  this thing is flying and stays cool too  edit  2 just so you know the ethernet has slow speeds so you wanna look into getting a usb to ethernet adapter with speeds that exceed your upload and download speeds  i just so happen to have one laying around and it made download and upload speeds way better  even if you don t have one they re fairly cheap  edit 3  got it running vr with a mixed reality headset  works great while recording at 1080p 30fps using obs  only one issue is that i have to restart the machine if it s been turned off and swap the usb cable into another port on boot or it won t work with the mixed reality portal  i ordered a usb 3 0 pci card  hopefully that fixes the issue  either way i got the headset for  250  and i have a perfect vr machine on a budget    take your  1 000  pcs  and  600  headsets and shove em   dnice computer with usb 3 0you for around usd 200 you get an excellent computer  i love the fact that this has usb 3 0 which opens the machine up for a whole bunch of devices  fast external transfers to hardrive or even an hdmi to usb adaptor in case i need to run more screens  mine did not have hdmi  only vga  and the new video connector  be prepared to buy an adapter unless you want to use vga  i added a low profile video card which allows me to have three screens  it comes with windows 10  i got the 500 gb model since i knew i was going to replace the hard drive with ssd  i have had great luck with easus backup  it just copies your system to another drive then you replace the drive  it did come with a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse like brand new   excellent dealthis refurbished computer is an excellent value  first of all  the computer was packaged as if it were new in a box with heavier and thicker cardboard than i am used to seeing on new desktop units  i had read all the other reviewers on the refurbish units from the various suppliers and i was concerned that i would get a unit that worked ok but looked liked as it served about 3 years or so in heavy use under lease   that the cabinet would come all banged up with dents and scratches as some other reviewers noted  to my great surprise and delight  the unit looked totally brand new  the steel outer box was perfect with no scratches  also  the fan and hard drive were nearly silent making me think that they may have been replaced  the only thing i could find wrong was that the ethernet socket seemed to prevent the cable in making a solid connection  therefore  the loose connection caused the the internet connection to go on and off when the computer was moved  however  i added a usb plug in wifi adapter and all was well  i have not yet tried the dvd drive but everything else so far is working great  so that you know about my experience in purchasing computers  this was my probably my 7th desktop computer i purchased for personal home use  and many more for work  but my first refurbish unit  therefore  i have some reference in judging the quality of the case  quietness  and other features of the computer i absolutely love this computeri absolutely love this computer  if i didn t know better  i thought this was a new computer  it is in great shape  no sign it was ever used before  the inside was absolutely clean too  i am very impressed by the way they refurbished the system  it came with windows 10 pro  a brand new hp keyboard  mouse  mouse pad and even a warranty card from hp  you really can t beat the price  the system is fast and extremely quiet as well  as a bonus  it didn t come with a bunch of bloatware like some brand new systems do  the motherboard came with 4 memory slots and only 2 were used to make up the 8gb  so i can always add more memory if i ever have the need to  this is the second used computer i purchased from amazon  the first one was sold by a different seller and the quality of that computer and the software installed was no where close to this one  i will continue to buy from this seller in the future like new condition  it is rare for me to give five stars for a computer  but this computer is way better than what i was expecting  basically it is brand new  it just worked right out of the box  the registration process for windows was exactly as described and quick and painless  it is a really fast computer  i really could not be happier  the case itself had one tiny scratch  and was very clean  it has a built in speaker that is very good  the included keyboard and mouse are perfect  for what they are  i got this for my kids  but now i am jealous mucho bang for the buck i can t be happier for the price  the pc arrived clean  with win 10 loaded and activated  as well as some quite useful apps  vlc  open office  7 zip   although not advertised with one  mine came with a nano wi fi adapter plugged in the back  first thing i did was swap the hard drive with a new 240gb ssd  so i shouldn t have any hd issues anytime soon  pc is running smooth and snappy  the only con i see is that if the power supply ever goes out  i might have trouble replacing it  it is a snug  case fan power supply combo  l  shaped  and if you did find one that fit  you would also need to buy a 20 to 4 adapter for it  the power supply is weird  and definitely one of a kind  definitely the way to go for either a work or home pc if you don t want to break the bank  8gb memory  quad core i5    a new machine would be twice as much with same specs  i recommend this unit highly thanks for a great experienceboth orders were as described  one was dirty in the dvd tray  had problems with software on one  i caused the problem  called support and a very helpful person walked me through it  i was so impressed that i ordered a second computer    thanksgreat computer  fired right up and works greatgreat computer  fired right up and works great  windows license verified properly and i was able to upgrade to windows 10 right away  works perfectly for streaming video  would buy this again if i needed a new pc games with the best of them got this for  185 before the price started going up  came in excellent condition with a new hard drive  keyboard  and mouse  i was able to activate windows quickly  came with two 4gb ram sticks and i intend to add two more for a total of 16gb ram  i dropped a  150 gtx 1050 ti mini in it  while i can t close the case now and should have used a gtx 1050 ti low profile  it works great and crushes all of my games at 1080p  i m amazed at how well this thing works best bang for your buck this is an amazing offer  the pc looks clean and brand new  could ve fooled me but the refurbished box it comes in gave it away  had a small issue with the activation of windows but they responded quickly and just told where to find the product key in the packaging   i just missed it  at this great price i was surprised to find it came with a mouse and key board  although i won t be using them since i have my own set that s a little bonus i didn t expect  sure the mouse and keyboard aren t the best quality but they work  the case is actually not as ugly in person as i thought mostly all of its metal  i was just looking for components because i ll be moving them all over to a new case  had it up and running with all the updates after an hour or so after i activated windows  all specs match and all i think i need now is a hdmi card and graphics card  this pc is perfect to build on and the inexpensive aspect makes it good for a beginner or child s pc  1st pic is pc  2nd is included mouse and keyboard  3rd is case i ll be moving it to along with my other peripherals vga display port output  slim design so far so good  i purchased hoping to be able to add a video card and drive two more monitors  added the xfx amd radeon hd 5450 1gb gddr3 vga dvi hdmi low profile pci express video card and it functions perfectly  the computer is slim and really needs to be horizontal because the disc drive does not hold cds securely  note  you will have to modify the bias and enable the onboard video and make it the primary to get more than 2 monitors running  i have 4 running now  the machine has a vga and display port output  i bought some display port to hdmi cables  the video card has hdmi and dvi  so i had to buy the dvi to hdmi cable to connect it  the computer is really fast  you will not be able to add a bigger power supply   just no room steal of a dealafter reading some of the negative reviews i was a little apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished computer  after receiving this computer all of those negative reviews were proven wrong  this computer came well packaged  with a new keyboard and mouse  and a fresh version of windows 10 ready to boot up and register under my name  it was almost as good as getting brand new computer  it is a fast little computer that i am happy i purchased  i feel i should mention that the cd dvd drive in the computer was a little iffy when i started installing my software packages  occasionally it wouldnt read the disk and i had to eject it and try again  it eventually gave out completely  i contacted the seller and they without question sent me a replacement  installed it tonight and all is good  for the price this was a heck of a deal  i would not hesitate purchasing a refurbished computer in the future and if i did i would make sure i purchased it from skytech usa llc bargain computer that works great i picked this up streaming in my bedroom  i installed a  20 dual band usb wifi adapter  a bluetooth adapter  and a cheap hd low profile video card and still only had about  250 invested  this works incredibly well for this purpose  the sling tv app which has issues periodically has worked incredibly well using this as has the tablo app  great solution for cord cutters hp did not design support these machines to work with windows 10  update your bios from hp to v2 99 if not already there i m giving 5 stars because these are really good machines  and the company appears to have done an excellent job making sure they were in top condition for resale  i even ordered an extra one too  they all came nice and clean  with a fresh build of windows 10 pro  and valid license  all was going good until microsoft pushed out the  fall creators update   and during one of the many reboots  the updating machines now decided to not come back up  a very frustrating blue screen at start up saying they needed to be repaired  hmm    the company was responsive but at this point could only offer a build disk  i had already downloaded the win 10 iso from microsoft  as i was trying to make the repairs via a boot thumb drive  nothing worked  although i could not decipher the error code  i felt it somehow was hardware related  so  doing some research  i found a blog entry asking if the main bios version would work with a different graphics card  this was not my case  but i checked on my bios version  both computers came with 2 51  on the hp web site  there is update bios available  version 2 99 and version 3 04  why two  hmm   opened the readme in the 3 04 update and it states if upgrading from 2 xx  you must first upgrade to 2 99  reboot  then upgrade to 3 04  thank goodness i read the readme  so  2 am  i m up  i build a dos boot thumb drive  thank you rufus  and copied over the 2 99 version files  i also copied over the 3 04 files to an additional directory  in anticipation on going up to 3 04  another interesting thing on the hp website  these machines are not supported for windows 10  hmmm  interesting   they worked when i received them with windows 10  after the 1st machine successfully update the bios to 2 99  i tried booting with the win 10 ms boot media  all of a sudden  the win 10 updated started up again  whoo hoo  so  while that was updating  i went ahead and started the 2nd pc  good update to 2 99  but the win 10 build media was still in use with the other machine  so i went ahead and pushed up to 3 04  all looks great  when i freed up the win 10 boot media  i did not get the same elation of my hd going into update mode as the other one did  i ended up with the same previous  something wrong  boot blue screen  after machine  1 finished updating  i went ahead and updated that bios to 3 04  all is well  machine  2  although never came out of  upgrade hell   is back up and running  but i had to reinstall win 10 from scratch  so far  the license on the machine seems to be fine and no issues from microsoft  oh   when the 3 04 didn t work on the update  i tried to downgrade it to 2 99  it would not let me downgrade  all attempts created checksum errors  my 3rd machine came with bios version 2 98 and didn t seem to experience these upgrade problems  i have a feeling that further microsoft windows 10 updates may crash these systems  i kinda hope the company can send us windows 7 re install disks for when this happens this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based    this pc was in exceptional condition upon arrival  based on looks alone you wouldn t have any idea that this was a refurbished device  it boots up in less than 20 seconds  is virtually silent  has not slowed down during browsing or streaming 4  different videos from various websites and normal day to day usage  installed a gtx 1050 ti and it is able to play cod ww2  the witcher   wolfenstein 2 and quantum break at 1080p averaging upwards of 58fps for all with mixed settings  the included power supply unit is capable of powering a 1050 ti with no issues excellent deali m very happy with this purchase  setup took under 1 hour even with a separate new monitor  i should have bought them together to get the  20 amazon discount   and i was watching the winter olympics during setup    we considered a chrome book  which i think is a good solution if you want a laptop  but my wife said that she would never move it off of her home office desk  this provided a lot more computing power and storage per    i d already ordered a monitor   two things to consider  1   it doesn t come with office software  we bought home and student from amazon  cheaper than getting it from ms   and we only needed 1 computer  so 365 was a more expensive rental than just buying it  2   it s designed to sit flat with rubber coasters  it works fine set on end as shown in the photo  but it was a little too deep for my wife s shallow desk when set flat  so we put it on the floor  in that orientation the cd dvd drive is vertical  that s no big problem imo  but some people may not like that  performance has been excellent awesomehaving researched a vast amount of time  and being doubts about buying a refurbish model  i can tell you this  it was exactly as expected  arrived clearly on time  package was well packed  and the system worked just great  i ordered a display port to hdmi adapter and worked like a charm  ordered a wifi   bluetooth adapter  that worked great  and yes there was sound to the 65  samsung via that adapter  i couldn t be more pleased  by the way  this review  however rare for me  was unsolicited by the seller    they don t even know      excellent bargainvery pleased with this purchase  apart from one tiny scratch on the base  a black sharpie soon took care of that  it s in excellent condition  barely even a hint of dust around the fan intakes  the supplied keyboard and mouse were fresh off the shelf  no problems with the genuine windows 10 installation   my biggest problem was running the gauntlet of adding it to my  mycrostuffed  account  hardly the fault of the pc supplier  pleased to report a distinct lack of pre installed cr  p ware and ad ware  the only thing i could see was vlc player which i would have installed anyway  i m using it exclusively as a stand alone audio workstation and it runs like an express train it works like it is brand newordered sunday 09 24 17  this item arrived on 9 26 17 with free shipping  the computer looks brand new  it works like it is brand new  the item was easy to set up  it runs very quietly  everything is as advertised  the price of  182 00 is well worth it  i purchased a four year warranty from 4 square  the only problem with that i believe they will only repair up to what you paid for the computer for a standard contract  the price of the contract was only around 23 00 with the tax  i wonder if they would send you a new refurbished computer of the same specifications  well all in all it was a great product  and the package came very well packed  very neat clean machine and excellent support i purchased this from ustechno  it arrived way ahead of schedule like 4 days ahead  the computer was properly wrapped and in an hp box  i had a problem getting the cover off  which i found out from google is a problem with this style computer  i called technical support  which answered promptly  they couldn t get to me right away but promised to call me back shortly  within 45 min they called  now  i couldn t get to the computer so they promised to call me back on saturday and the did  the problem was resolved  once cover was off the inside was very clean and computer booted to windows 10 screen  all ports are working  very nicegreat budget friendly desktop for multitasking or light gamingfor anyone looking for a solid foundation in a machine for light gaming or multitasking  this is a good place to start  i added an 850 evo and the machine is very responsive now  it s the only upgrade i ve done to it   highly  highly suggest to put an ssd in this if you re going to buy it the packaging was very well done  the desktop was protected in styrofoam  there is a key you will need to use to activate windows  the machines that i got  i purchased two  look incredibly clean  brand new even  i had the machines since november with no issues at all  no situation for me to use the warranty  i can see myself adding a low profile gpu  but since the psu is specific to this case  i know i won t be able to go too crazy with power  but that s alright because this isn t meant for all out powergreat desk topcomputer arrived on time and was well packaged  booted right up and had zero issues loading up windows 10  computer operates fast and smooth  needed to upgrade our old dell desk top as it was slow and nearing the end of the line  looked at new dells and other similar desk tops and they ran over 400 dollars new  glad i went the refurb route  will update my review in a year but so far i d recommend so glad i bought thisfor a little over  200  this is a great deal and i couldn t be happier with it  the windows 10 activation code worked  it boots quickly  there wasn t a bunch of extra junk installed  just the junk that normally comes with windows 10   i ve been using it for almost a week and i haven t had any problems at all  the computer actually seems brand new  i got mine from microbee and it came securely packed with industrial strength bubble wrap  it even came with a new keyboard  mouse  and power cable  they re just generic  but it s nice to have back ups impressedvery happy with my purchase  although i will be using this as a secondary computer  i couldn t be more happier  came with an official windows 10 installed  no bloatware  out of the box  everything ran flawlessly  i know it refurbished because i was told so at purchase time  otherwise  everything looks pristine  outside and inside  not a single scratch or dent  either  the hdd runs at 7200 rpm  so that is a plus  i don t intend to run any games on it  so no opinion about that  but  even with the intel graphics 2500  autocad 14 runs as a charm  and loads it pretty quick  i was not expecting that   all in all  for the price  it s a bargainall capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the    bought this from sj computers llc  the pc has no physical damage on it and came clean  opened case to inspect motherboard for bulging capacitors  all capacitors checked out perfectly fine  booted up the computer and ran through the windows first install  got into windows and noticed firefox browser shortcut on the desktop  i checked the system specs to make sure the processor was correct and the amount of ram was correct  i then exit windows and ran a memory test and hard drive test built into the diagnostics section when tapping  esc  key while the system is booting up  hard drive and ram check out fine  i then used my download ios of windows 10 pro on usb and re installed windows pro by deleting all partitions  then installing only that  windows 10 pro prompted me to insert the windows cd key that is on top of the case on the outside on a sticker  windows accepted the cdkey and windows 10 pro installed without issue  once back into windows  checked system properties and it showed windows 10 as activated  this is a extremely good deal for a 4 core i5 and 8gb of ram this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer    wow  this is an amazing deal  not sure how they can even offer this price with an authenticate version of windows 10 pro  great all purpose computer as long as you don t expect to play modern  graphics intensive games for an unbeatable price  i bought this to replace my basement computer that runs two monitors including my 110  projector screen  surround sound and outdoor patio speakers  the computer is not used often  but when it is i am usually having guests over and streaming a webcast concert  playing movies or just playing music on it  my old computer was taking too long to boot into windows and load apps even off standby or just being left on  it started to take 5  minutes to become usable which was embarrassing in front of guests  i bought this computer and swapped out the hdd for a 500gb ssd and it kicks butt  the boot time to the windows desktop is literally about 6 seconds and i can immediately load spotify or a browser to youtube  i run a normal monitor to the desk on vga and another display port to vga to my projector screen  i am not gaming  but full hd video looks great  i have a usb audio device which pushes digital optical surround to a sony receiver for the movie room or stereo to another sony receiver to power my outdoor patio and deck speakers  everything runs smooth and fast and looks and sounds great  still can t believe i got this computer for  200 or  365 with upgraded ssd  really great deal quad cpus  8gig ram  integrated usb3the computer was delivered and packaged in a perfect fit oem box  well placed and insulated against damage  there isn t one blemish on the computer  not a scratch  nick or anything to give one the impression this computer was ever removed from the box and used  it even had the slight smell of new electronics  win 10 was pre installed  it is a turn key system  all you need do is turn it on and the boot is so fast you can t read what keys are used for setup or boot menu  and fast  one of the reasons i selected this model was it had usb3 integrated  i don t want to buy and install a usb3 host card  the usb2   usb3 adapters are tight  the on off switch feels like it has never been used  and the system is fast  i m a retired programmer and this is now my recreational computer  household networked wired at 1 gigabit  whether work or play this computer is fast  meets and exceeds my expectations  i recommend the make   model of this computer  i highly recommend purchasing from blair technology ordered 3  got 3 good pcsreceived 3 of these for the office  the appearance and specs are pretty close to the other 100  already in use  most of them were also refurbs  but these have the better core i5 and more memory than the others  it was not one of these 3 but far i have only seen one bad refurb unit that had the rear by the expansions cards smashed in which shorted something on the motherboard  of these 3  all arrived in good shape  no dust  a few small scuffs and tiny scratches but nothing that affects functionality  they all had 3 different brand model 500gb hard drives  2 different seagates and 1 wd blue  likely also refurbs   they all work well  no complaints  and i am picky  perfect computer for my mom  i bought this computer for my mom  who just needs to surf the internet and play some games on it  it works great  just follow the instructions on activating the windows program and you are on your way to a very fast computer  she has had it for a few months and has had no problems with it  the case was clean and it was shipped in a sturdy box  no problems at all  i was wary buying a refurbished computer  but it works great and the price you just can t beat good value for a refurbished computeri was also a bit paranoid about buying this computer with the mixed reviews for other verified purchases  my computer was packed perfectly  smelled and looked like a new computer  i also has a normal noise output  it is quite fast for work processing and internet use  i wouldn t expect this computer to perform like a state of the art workstation for photo and video editing  its a great deal for  189  but    the keyboard didn t work  not a biggie since i had the one from my broken computer  also i had a challenging time setting up my login id for the first time  this is a windows 10 thing  not really the fault of the computer  i spent a bit of time surfing the internet reading about all the other people having the same type of problem and eventually figured out the workaround  dammit microsoft  i d say its worth buying  if you get a lemon  then send it back and order another one  i couldn t fix my old computer for the price of this one the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan    the computer booted upon being plugged in  not a fan of this but i expected it   performance feels right  not slow but not an ssd  i m using it to run 4 1080p ip cameras using blue iris  it is hovering about 38  cpu utilization  note  dp and vga  no hdmi  half height cards only  the computer arrived clean with no noticeable odors  i ll update this review if it dies excellent computerthis is an excellent computer for its price  i bought two of them so far for my kids  10 and 7  and plan on buying another one soon to replace my daughter s  12  laptop  my kids are really into gaming and this computer handles games like world of warcraft  league of legends  and fortnite  with 8 gb of ram and an i5 processor  you are on your way to a beastly little machine  for my kids  we plan on getting them a video card replacement  i read through other reviews and it seems that the geforce gtx 1050 low profile is one of the best for it  even without the video card though  they are very happy with the computer  on other notes  the case is small and perfect for laying down or standing up  it is easy to open and everything inside is easily accessible if needed  oh  and don t forget to buy a usb wifi adapter if you don t plan to plug directly in great customer service received the pc  and upon arrival noticed that it had bent in corner  not allowing the side panel to be removed  and it appeared to have been dropped  but  that was pretty much irelevent to me since i wanted performance  setup was non existent  it is simply plug and use  the pc performed flawlessly  btw  yes it can be used for light to medium gaming  except that there was a grinding like noise coming from the hard drive  i understand that hard drives make noise  but it got really loud at one point  the computer was probably fine  and i never noticed any issues with the computer s actual performance  that being said  i let my picky nature get the best of me  and returned the pc  i will gladly say that the ustecno customer service it top notch  totally satisfied  they even paid shipping   got my money back way sooner than expected  ik its weird that someone who decided to return the product is giving it a 5 star review  but i got my money back quick  and the pc didnt actually have any performance issues  overall satisfied  fyi i purchased mine through ustecnosuper happy with purchase i got this for my wife  one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  i built the desktop my wife was using about 5 years ago and she was complaining how slow it was  rather than build another i got the hd that came with the pc as a back up  super happy with this purchase  the corner was slightly damaged during shipping and the company gave me a small credit for the damage  great company to do business with  no complaints from the wife any more and that was the goal  keep em happy what a great deal i was looking for a computer that i can setup as a dedicated file server for my business  typically since i am handy i buy all the parts and assemble it myself  i ran across this refurbished unit and just could not see how i could beat the price  a i5 quad core with 8gb ram for under  200   the unit was packed very well and arrived in great shape  what a deal  being it is a refurb there are parts that are old that you may want to replace  the 500gb hdd was made in 2008  so it is 10 years old  i was able to replace it with a ssd and a 1tb hdd  everything else has an mtbf of a long time from now  additionally the hp compact cabinet is nice and small and very well designed for servicing and limited expansion mine runs great 60 days of daily use for my wife seems to work fine  i have this setup on dual monitors with the use of a display port to vga adapter    your setup may be different    runs great  she accidently somehow hit ctrl win c key combo which turned the displays b w and i thought the video card had gone out for a minute   but i was able to correct it with a little search on the internet  if you just want to surf the internet  work with office docs  email and play some games that don t require a video card   this is great little machine  try troubleshooting and searching things up yourself in a search engine before calling a service man or sending things back   sometimes it s simple user error great deal  even better customer service great deal  and superior customer service  i had a couple problems that they resolved in a reasonable amount of time  the system itself is fine  i added an ssd and now it s lightning fast  perfect for my home media center server  after a video card upgrade this is a very  very nice gaming system for cheap  for less than  150 more you can have a more than adquate game box  look online or youtube  alot of people know this is the cheapest build for the power you need for high end games    jus sayin    and remember  their customer service is really great works like a champi use this as a media server for my living tv  i run kodi and plex fine  had to purchase a dp to hdmi cable though because it didnt have that connection  other than that its rock solid  using it daily for almost two months without any issues  the fan is super quiet bargain price for a solid machinemuch nicer than expected  computer arrived nicely packaged and clean  only a few minor scratches on the bottom of the case  inside was clean as well  booted up without any trouble  registered a clean oem version of windows 10 pro as advertised  ran a scan on the hard drive  no bad sectors  the cost of the computer was less than the cost of buying windows 10 pro  that coupled with the i5 processor makes this a great bargain excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that    excellent  after about 30 days my software reported that it was not legitimate  so i contacted the seller and they advised that i needed to activate windows by using the windows code on the back of the computer  now i have a great computer with legitimate windows copy  the mouse and keyboard that were included came in broken  keyboard was missing buttons  yet i had my own so no need for those  thanksnice little packagei compared every desktop i could find on amazon and this one seemed to be the most bang for the buck  i just received it and had to change a few things  i am running an older cpu on vista  trying to keep my business organized  i was very pleased with this upgrade  fast processor  whisper quiet  8 gb ram  and 500g is plenty of storage  fairly represented and delivered very fast  this turned out to be such a nice cpu that i upgraded the monitor     computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass upi was skeptical at first about buying a refurbished computer but i figured the price was just too good to pass up  after reading the other reviews and looking at some other desktops i went ahead with the purchase and i do not regret it at all  the computer came boxed up very well and included the keyboard and mouse  i have had no problems with the computer and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a desktop computer but cannot afford a fancy one  this does everything i need it to do and it s slim enough for the desk i bought  10 10very surprised by the qualityfor    200  this is an excellent purchase  mine came with very few scuffs  but the hardware on the inside looked brand new  hdd seems to be brand new and runs fast  i am able to run photoshop  dreamweaver  and have multiple tabs on chome open at the same time  i haven t had the need for higher performance so i don t know the limit  for a refurbished desktop  i was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product  comes with windows 10  you just have to activate it    super simple process that is explained in a piece of paper that they send you   you will need to buy your own usb wireless adapter  i bought mine for less than  10  to connect to wifi or just hook up to ethernet  desktop has built in speakers better than i thought it would be  so far this is an amazing machine for the money  it was very professionally packaged  booted up and activated fine  and i m installing adobe cc on it and apps are running great  i have all my syncing going on to adobe  google drive  and one drive all with no problems  i m not sure what happened to you other folks that say these are bad because i m seeing nothing of the sort  mine was refurbished by ast and everything was clean inside and out besides very minimal wear  like three tiny specs on the bottom edge of the case   no dust or wear on the inside at all  oh  and they sent along a usb keyboard and mouse i didn t expect  win    now to just get a upgrade for graphics and additional ram and i ll be set  a bad ass bargain hot rod wow  this thing is bad ass   i have another desktop with an i7 possessor but this one seems to move just as quick  a very good bargain  no matter what you get today  it will be out of date in less tan five years a great bargainreceived the pc today and had it up and running without issue in 30 minutes  you can not tell it s a refurbished unit from the look of it  specs match what was posted and is a great step up from my 10 year old desktop for general family pc use  can not find a better value for performance vs cost with this gently used business pc with better specifications than a new same cost unit at a big box brick and mortar store works like a charm at a discounted pricewas a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished desktop pc  but after reading the reviews and test driving this puppy for a week  i am more than satisfied with my purchase  was delivered earlier than quoted  fully loaded with windows 10 os  took minutes to set up right out of the box  works like a charm  and i would gladly repurchase good dealgot this for a set up i was prepping for someone using a cnc machine  paired it with a 5v parallel card and he says it s working great  i build and work on computer regularly  this computer was cleaned up well and in good shape  only thing i was a little iffy about  was the hard drive  mine had like 50 000 hours on it   but no bad sectors and drive is working fine as of now  drive are easy to replace though too  so even if it went out i would say this was a good deal for the price great computervery good computer for this price  i previously had an issue with a faulty power cord and after contacting the seller  in my case  microbee  they sent out a new cord  i d bet my cord being faulty was not the norm  i m very satisfied with their customer service great    super fast with ssd upgrade  we had to install a cheap graphics card to get hdmi support for large 32 in monitor  total money in this fast computer is way less than a new one with comparable specs i had none of the negative issues that some people    i had none of the negative issues that some people have had with this pc  well maybe two small issues  one with the initial opening of the side panel  it took me about ten minutes to figure out why it was stuck and now it opens and closes with no problem  there was a metal tab inside of the lever that was hanging up  i was able to use a small jeweler s screw driver to bend it so that it wasn t hanging up  the other issue was where i took the advice that one person mentioned about not using a coin to get the windows 10 product key  i lightly scratched the surface  it was a little hard to see one of the letters clearly but i was able to see enough to try a couple of different values to get to the correct one  if a value wasn t one of the accepted microsoft values it wouldn t let you type it in  those plus a couple of small scratches were minor  i have purchased refurbished monitors that had more scratches on them but have been functioning for about three years now with no problem  after i fired it up i applied all updates and cloned the hard drive to a larger hard drive and haven t had any problems with it  i plan on adding another 8 gbs next month very happy with this machine so farvery happy with this machine so far  quick  windows 10 installed  simple instructions to register  i just loaded my paid version of office  works great  i am very happy with the test run so far  it will be a second work station and basic home use  for the price i m excited  and manuals are available online    professional packing as well with keyboard and mouse includedvery please with this upgradeinstalled and runs great  i added a 250gb western digital blue solid state drive and after building my system as i wanted it  cloned to the ssd  it is more than powerful enough for office work  as clean as a new unit  installing windows 10 from the image on the hard drive was easy  but i must say installing all the software i used on my old pc requires considerable pc smarts  you obviously need to have original cds  keys  etc  then moving data files from the old pc may not be easy for many folks as some data files are not easy to locate  i had to upgrade several programs and you may have to uninstall from an old pc to use the license for the new pc  email accounts need to be set up again  these are things to deal with when buying an off the shelf new pc also  just warning you it isn t entirely easy to upgrade mine is great idk about all these other reviews       i was skeptical at first about buying a  used  computer but this thing is nice  sure it is a desktop and old fashioned looking but its fast and nothing came pre loaded from the previous owner  8 gigs of ram and an i5 for  212 at the time of purchase is an incredible deal  mine came with a mouse and keyboard this computer is perfectto be honest    at first i was skeptical about buying a refurbished desktop computer  and there were several horror story worthy reviews on similar models  however  the desktop arrives exactly when it was supposed to and booted up like new out of the box  just to be thorough  i did my own factory restore so it was as clean as possible  it s fast  it s quiet  and i intend on installing a gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 and turning it into a gaming computer  couldn t be happier this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order    this is a wonderful computer  i was a little hesitant to order a refurbished computer but this little jewel has performed outstandingly great deal on a computera good system for less than half the price of a new one  this unit looks like it was very lightly used  not a mark on it and very clean on the inside  using it as a dvr as well as other computer functions  very fast for an older computer  i m very happy with it and i would order it again it does the job after some additional option additions the unit is just right for my purposes of using it exclusively for my home entertainment system  i did add a graphic card upgrade and an hdmi splitter for connection to a local monitor and to my onkyo receiver  so far am very happy with the unit  blair s customer service was very responsive to my inquiries a five star experience from start to finishmy refurbished hp compaq elite 8300 sff pc has been an absolute delight  its condition  inside and out is absolutely indistinguishable from brand new  the case design  in my opinion  is brilliant  with four available pcie slots  10 usb ports  and front   rear audio output ports  the case is easily opened without tools  and the drive cages are very easy to access for swapping things around  the first thing i did was to transfer the system drive to a 240gb wd blue ssd  and format the original as my d  drive  hp s technical manuals  which are available as pdfs at hp com  are models of clarity and fine detail  i am also pleased to give kudos to the vendor  ast  astsys com  for their excellent technical support when i had some questions about drivers  with amazon s usual prompt and efficient delivery as promised  this purchase has been a five star experience from start to finish solid pc for the price this is a great buy for the price  i don t need anything fancy at home  just some web browsing and microsoft office  i hate to spend a lot of money and so far this has worked well  came well packaged and in like new condition with no noticeable dings or scratches  windows launched the first time and activated successfully  one of the best things to note is that it did not come with a bunch of bloatware very easy setup  everything went smoothlyjust as promised  very easy setup  everything went smoothly  plugged in usb wifi  600mbps wireless usb wifi adapter  faytun  prior to turning on and setup went perfectly  tip  take a picture of the windows 10 product key  located on a label on top of the case  with your phone so you can zoom in to see it clearly when you enter it to authorize windows during setup  case was clean inside and out  pc runs fast so far  no heavy software installed yet  plenty of usb ports some other reviews indicated they were surprised to receive a keyboard and mouse  my didn t  not that i was supposed to  pc came in a padded box with a power cord and hdmi adapter essential for a budget gaming build arrived 4 days ahead of time  very well packaged and easy to set up  came with mouse and keyboard  the only thing i needed to purchase was a display port to hdmi cable  it doesn t come wi fi ready  have a long ethernet cable or adapter ready  the computer was undoubtedly a steal  the processor alone is nearly  150  if you re doing a budget build  pairing this with a gtx 1050 lp is the way to go  seller went by the name  microbee great value  works well and looks goodlove it  arrived very quickly  excellent packaging   the ups guy could have run over it with his truck and not damaged it  very clean machine inside and our  if the light is just right  i can see a couple of finger prints on the outside   could very well be from me  good people to work with  i had a couple of issues  not the machines fault  and they when above my expectations to resolve  they are a small company  so don t expect a receptionist to answer the phone if you call  left a message and they got back to me within an hour or so  i would use again and recommend  if you don t need the latest and greatest  this will save you hundreds pretty and practicalfor day to day tasks this machine is a bargain  it s compact  silent  looks neat  and is fast enough  win10pro is also a plus great windows 10 pro machine for the price   i will probably buy moreloving this computer  great form factor  great specs  i am using it as a normal house computer  it is a windows 10 pro machine for a great price  mine came packaged great and really i dont see any scuffs on it  may buy a few more for our church office great pc  mine looked brand new  fastexcellent desktop replacement for my wife when her computer was dying  this thing is quite fast  it required about 5 10 reboots at first as windows 10 updated itself  after that i cloned the hard drive to a ssd drive     and removed the original hdd  the thing is very fast  quiet and looked brand new  no smell whatsoever on mine  this was a steal  very satisfied with this purchase ustecno is awesomethe first computer arrived damaged  but it shipped from canada so that is to be expected some of the time  i don t blame the seller at all  and when i contacted them about it they sent a replacement right away  the pc is a great deal  throw a low profile 1050 in it and you can run any modern game  you can buy a 24 to 6 pin adapter for  2 and hook up any power supply you want  the i5 3470 in this computer makes it worth purchasing  i initially gave a 1 star because it arrived damaged  but after the outstanding responce from usteco i m giving it 5 because this is a steal for the pricedelightfully i received a real good oneextremely satisfied with this hp  the power of processing is a huge improvement over the old hp i was still using vista  you can imagine the learning curve with windows 10  however once i made the adjustment  wish i had up graded a long time ago  machine was just like brand new one little scratch mark on the back of the computer access door  i did call customer service regarding the verification of windows 10 or registration  very nice and courteous and responded with in hours  i am impressed  turned out the solution was with the computer all the time  i had over looked the obvious great for the moneygreat computer  little dirty and could not get the side panel open for the life of me  i had to disassemble it in all kinds of ways to get it to come off  then i had to youtube it to rebuild it  i didn t take a star away from it for that as i will assume it was not done on purpose  it works fine now  to grade it on speed and response time i have to say it s great  a great experience computer was delivered on time and was packaged well  appearance of a brand new computer  it s early  but so far  everything works as hoped  this replaces a 32 bit dell xps machine and  for the cost of about  200  is a significant step up and a real bargain  it s the first refurbished machine i ve ever purchased  i only wish i d done it earlier  i appreciate skytech s service and professionallism its a performer the processor on this is solid  ram is good  hard drive and networking is working  what more could you want for 200 bucks great cheap gaming computerlove it for sims 3 plus all expansions   also play koatr perfect plus sims 4  skyrim se tho i took this off as it limited space and i dont play skyrim that muchgood computer  ready to work  and great pricethis computer has been flawless since i got it  it was well packaged and ready to use right out of the box  i opened it up whenever i received it to check things out  and it was as clean inside as a new one right off the line  this computer has been gently used and was ready to go to work  it has been exactly what i needed for my home office  windows 10 was pre installed and a cheap  but functional  keyboard and wired mouse were included  i was concerned about buying used electronics  but this has turned out to be a very good purchase omg excellent computer  crazy fast  worth every pennythis pc its excellent  i play games in this  super ultra fast  i install a ssd  but the difference its not big  because this desktop its crazy fast with the hdd  i will upgrade to 12gb of ram amazing computer for super entry level costwhen the desktop arrived i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the computer for the price it was listed at  i ve replace the hdd with a 2 tb model and i m using the 500gb one that it came with in another project of mine  i ve successfully turned this into my own home virtualization server and find it is able to keep up more than i originally thought it would  for those who will more than likely keep windows 10 installed and use it as their day to day machine this definitely can and did keep up better than my work issued surface pro 4 and

to an hp pc i bought about 8 years ago and was priced over 800 so this one was the same or better specs and i love it  plus hp offers all downloads for the hardware and i like that it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer outhey  i don t know what to say  i m not going to get into technical details here  i don t have that much time  but i can only say that this is the first computer that i have bought  and i have bought many in the last 40 years  that really impressed me right out of the box  i brought the box it came in  unpacked it  and plugged it in and wham mo it worked  i was up and running in less than 20 minutes wed  15 nov  first thing in the morning i came in and turned the computer on  and was instantly confronted by a blue screen informing me that it was installing updates  next it restarted and i was confronted by the blue screen of death  i click on the options and was taken to a recovery screen  but none of the options there worked  i went and turned on another computer  then looked up the seller s web page  and both emailed them and called their tech support  that was five days ago  and i still have not heard from them  having a pclinuxos operating system on a live cruz flash drive  i plugged that into a usb 3 port  and rebooted  it came up just fine  and i proceeded to check the computer out  operating on pclinuxos  the computer worked just fine  so i did a search for  windows 10 pro download   and a microsoft download site came up  so i went there and sure enough  microsoft let me download a fresh copy of windows 10 pro  and media creator program to build it  i built it on a flash drive  i took the flash drive and booted of it  and did a fresh install of the operating system  i will say that it installed faster than any operating system i have ever installed  even going back to dos  3 1  it is now nov  20  2017 and everything is working just fine  only exception to that is the touch screen keyboard that keeps showing up on the login screen  this is still the fastest computer that i have ever owned  including the i7 that sits next to it five starsgreat value   five starsworks great  thanksfive starsworks perfectly

like excel word  thanks great refurbished computerthis pc runs just fine out of the box  i have yet to run into any problems price is fantastic  switched the hard drive with an ssdprice is fantastic  switched the hard drive with an ssd  and it became a rocket ship  slim in size with windows 10 license  fantastic can t beat thatfive starsworks great  five starsa very well built  fast  reliable  computer  install an ssd and it will fly okokpleased with purchasevery satisfied with product much faster than old unit has met my expectations five starsthis is my second small form factor  the hp is much faster than the dell i bought earlier five starsvery nice computer for the price  easy access to internal components very nice pc for the price arrived sooner than expected  and performed well  exterior finish on the case was in good shape  package included new mouse  keyboard  and power cord  bios on the 8300 does not support booting from a pcie slot m 2 card  this isn t criticism  it is just an observation that this pc wasn t intended to do so  even with the latest bios from hp  on the other hand  the sata controller is one of the best i have seen  as even the included 5400rpm hard drive could get occasional bursts close to 600mb s  the sata ssd i ended up using actually benchmarked better than the nvme i had tested in the pcie x4   x16 slots   there is also a pcie x1  and regular pci slot on the motherboard  there is no standard internal drive bays for mounting additional hard drives  this pc was used to replace the controller pc for a computer guided cutter   cutter itself is rented  but terms stipulate we have to replace the failed pc  my intention was to leave the hdd mounted for use if the ssd fails  and add in the second drive  but  without any standard mounting options  i left the ssd sitting loosely in the case  in other words  the case cannot be used to draw heat from the ssd frame  nor is the ssd securely mounted  i doubt the connectors will work loose  as the pc is not moved often  and is not subject to external vibration  one hard lesson learned  as this was the first windows 10 drive i have cloned  windows 10 has  fast bootup   which is really just an improved hibernation mode  enabled by default  when you select  shutdown  in windows 10 with  fast bootup  enabled  it really just goes to  hibernate   when you clone the drive in that state  windows will give an error about a device required to boot the system being missing or inaccessible when you boot from the newly cloned drive  it is a very simple matter to disable hibernation or  fast bootup  in windows 10 before making a disk image  but it took me a while to make a correlation between that feature and the problem which occurred on boot up after cloning five starsmet all

reliable  true work horse five starsgoodgreat product and fantastic customer service2 days after i received my computer  it was infected with a malicious virus that froze everything  i contacted skytech usa llc  they explained that this was not covered by the warranty but because i had only for a couple of days  they would send me a new windows 10 disc or a hard drive with the os already installed  i chose the hard drive  this is customer service at its finest  they are to be commended for caring for their customers  thank you skytech and amazon for having them as a supplier worked as intended have had it for a while now  packaging and delivey was great as well as the product itself  no issues  and it works fine five starsi ofive starsworks great looks great  performs wellpleasantly surprised  looks great  performs well five starsworking wonderful fastest computer you will ever buy for this price  way over powered fastest computer i have ever bought   i mean yeah it wasn t brand new but you could barely tell  the only sign of use was they forgot to put back a small metal part of the back panel but that s it  it looked and smelled brand new  it even came with a keyboard  the only complaint was that it didn t come with the vga cable and the vga is horrible for photos and text but you tube is fine  you tube shows in 1080p just fine but i was surprised to see this used vga not div or hdmi  just how fast  i hit the power button and in less than a minute it loads up  to turn it off hit the power button and in about a minute it completely turns off  just how fast  i launch mozola browser and in seconds it loads  i then got to you tube     open up 25videos and play them all at the same time     open chrome browser open 25 youtube videos and play them all at the same time then open 50 vlc player instance and play them all at the same time  then open as many photos as i can plus open 25 windows folders plus google earth and the results       no problems  the cpu never ever goes above 17  never   i have been unable to get the cpu to go above 20  memory  the highest use the memory went was 40  and remember that s with 50 youtube playing at the same time  25mozola 25chrome  25windows folders open  bunches of photos open  50 vlc videos playing at the same time    yet the memory never goes about 40 five starsfast  very nice  and so cheap five starsgot it for my dad  it works five starsno glitches  gave my dad a affordable upgrade  thanks much works wellthe pc sent to me looks great with no visible signs of wear  the machine came pre installed with windows 10 and even came with a wireless network adapter  i think the experience may slightly differ depending on the seller  my seller was amazintechdeals and i couldn t be happier with them  as for the product itself  it s pretty snappy  i m only using it as a media server so won t be doing too much on it but it seems pretty solid  a couple things to note is there is no built in wireless and there is no hdmi connection for your monitor  so you ll need a wireless network adapter  if not provided by seller  and a different cable or adapter for your monitor five starsunbeatable price  packaged well  i would definately buy again five starsworked great   five starslove itfive starsfast shipping works great looks brand new five starseverything worked as

expectedbetter than expected   runs great has like ten usb ports which is great for usfive starsgoodgreat computer for low cost    couldn t be happier with it   one of my old computers was running really slowly on windows 10 to the point that i just stopped using it  so i decided i would get a used one that would make it less painful to get on line to do the things i do there    like answer e mails  pay bills  etc  my son  who is a computer engineer  recommended this one  it arrived and i have to say i am very pleased with it  it runs windows 10 easily and life on my computer is good once again the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports    the only problem i m having is the usb 3 ports will not read  this is a minor point but one that needs attention  we sat it up yesterday and everything excpt assre3 mentinned is reat greatsolid computer and good customer servicewe purchased this computer and  like most said  its not in perfect condition  but you can t expect a refurb to have no scratches  however  one great thing about these is there is no unwanted software on the computer thanks to them cleaning it up  we had an issue activating our windows license  and the customer service was extremely helpful in figuring out the problem  definitely would purchase from again if you need an affordable workhorse and can accept a few blemishes it looks like new and if you are worriedbought one at microcenter and i have to say that it is just as well built as lenovo   ibm  i pulled out the 500gb drive as it was slow as sin booting up   3 5min   put a firewire card in one slot and an inexpensive asus r7 240 video card and a dvd burner   comes with dvd reader only   it looks like new and if you are worried  visit a microcenter  put windows 7 ulitmate as this is what it came with and dont forget to go to hp web site to get the drivers if you run win 7      this system is quiet and powerful  from what i can see  it is an incredible buy for around 200   you could not build one for any where near this price  i usually do not buy hp since carly fiorina ran hp into the ground  but i have to say this one is solid and well built  it has 4 usb 2 0 ports on the front  but i want usb 3 on front  so i found a 3 5 inch 4 port usb hub on e bay from china   it plugs into a standard usb 3 port this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive    wanted something to edit my photography and do online shopping  this is perfect  will have to add a external hard drive soon but otherwise a great pc for those who want one to play with works fine  needs a wifi adapter

piece of folded paper taped to the bottom fixed this right up  did not include microsoft office  for the price we paid for this system  we are very pleased as long as it continues performing like it has so far  would absolutely order from this company again great value for the price  received item as described  works perfectly  beware  read the description carefully   it states monitors vary   it

being certified refurbished  i wanted to add wi fi on this computer  so i bought a simple wi fi usb plug in that i plugged into the back of the computer   cost was around  10 and now it has wi fi

i think for the price it is fabulous  i elected to get the refurbished versus the used option when purchasing from amazon  other than a new microsoft 7 product key on the side under the original

other than that oversight  it is great great for my aging eyesthis monitor is huge  great for my aging eyes  bigger than i had planned on it slickly adjusts up and down  i feel like an executive in my

wanted   www jw org  great computer  great company in blair technologygreat computer  great company in blair technology very good for the pricevery good machine for the money  over all this was a good purchase  i didnt expect this machine to be as good as it is  only had this for a few days but it is working fine so far  the case has a few marks on it and the screen looks like it has been used lightly before but the both look better than what i was replacing  the screen is clear and doesnt have any major defects  even though the cpu case isnt perfect the electronics work fine  i didnt expect a show piece i just needed a computer that works  the win 7 is the real reason for the purchase  the operating system is easy to use and has win 8 and 8 1 beat  if i knew that a refurb machine was going to be as good as this one i would have rethought putting off the purchase  i dont usually purchase used electronics but this purchase was worth the try  the packaging was very adequate for delivery through all the miles to florida  plenty of syrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap to keep anything from getting smashed  shipping and handling price was worth the price i paid  mouse and speakers are good enough to get the machine running and use till i get the more expensive ones that will probably break before these will  first time boot wasnt any different than any new machine   it took a few minutes of concentration to complete but not time consuming five starshi  i sont know what to say so hi great shopping experiencegreat shopping experience  smart  sophisticated  modern look  great

 quiet  simply perfect   impressive  a much better  stronger and faster computer than i expected  just plug and play    it came loaded with windows 10   a substantial investment to buy windows   also  with a backup disk  a usb wireless adapter  not a built in wireless card   and the power cord  it s whisper quiet and ready to rumble    refurbished is as good as new for me  and at a fraction of the cost of a new one   came from linkedpc  inc     i did need to login and register with microsoft  then i downloaded my favorite programs and installed  btw the dvd cd tray works fantastic    my 10 year old dell inspiron bit the dust  i had to have a desktop to replace her  shopping around i accidentally stumbled across this  wow  i scored    it is fast  i am not an online gamer  but  i do use facebook  a lot   have thousands of pictures  watch many youtubes  and play online casino games  ect  there has not even been a hiccup in anything i try to run  seamless    update 10 01 2017  still

found this review useful  thanks exactly as advertised  fully functional for great price exactly what i was told that i would get  was it the greatest computer ever built  no  was it an very very good computer for a very very low price  yes  yes it was  i got it as a christmas present for my mom  i fits all of her computer needs  streams video just fine  smooth and quiet functioning  nothing bad  wifi  wireless printing  noisiness  slow boot up and command response time were my worries  not problems on any of those fronts  it is a more than adequate computer for someone who isn t gaming their way through the internet or doing 100 000 things at once  it works properly and came with everything that it was supposed at an extremely reasonable price  and that is what i wanted  enough said very fast basic computer  at great price bought this to replace a 9 year old dell that was running windows vista  so it was time  i hesitated to get only a core 2 duo  since there are other faster ones  but after reading some of the reviews  and knowing that i only need to do basic web surfing  facebook  word processing  spreadsheets and emails  i thought  how bad can it be for  103   i am so pleased with it  took it out of the box  read the  read this first  sheet inside the box  hooked it up and turned it on  registered the windows 10 software and was up and running in about 20 minutes  this computer is screaming fast compared to the old one and i haven t had a single problem with it  blair technologies seems like a great seller and i had very fast shipping  i highly recommend this computer excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group    excellent product  btg refurbisher is really an excellent group to deal with  they will answer any questions and help with any issues  the win 10 installed works flawlessly and the computer looks essentially new  i like that it is not a tower but has a small footprint that allows it to be laid flat on the table  it has foot pads to allow that  the cd dvd drive will work better in that horizontal layout  you can put small items on the top of it since there are no air vents on the top or bottom  i have my modem and router sitting there  while it will work wirelessly  i prefer the easy ethernet wired hookup and use the wireless for my printer  a laptop  tablet  tv  chromebook  etc  with the ethernet connection i get high speeds in spite of the heavy use of the wireless for all those other uses   easy to install and the connections are obvious  no mike or camera but those with a usb connection are very inexpensive and work just fine  good product  excellent price and good support  what s not to like for a little over  100  an awesome product that was exactly what was neededthis is a very simple  straight forward computer that i purchased for the most basic of family needs  ms word  facebook  web surfing      the only thing i had to do was connect the basic attachments  monitor  keyboard and mouse   turn it on and away you go   there are 10 usb ports  a dvd read write and a nice size hard drive for what it will be used for  while i was not expecting such a large cpu tower  it does provide some room for any additional memory  drives ect  an older  refurbished  not super modern computer sometimes fits exactly what is needed  any more would be a waste  the shipping was super fast  it arrived a week early five starsgreat computer at a good value i liked it so much  i bought another one for home use wow  am i impressed  i bought this refurbished little gem to replace my 2012 dell

folks running very high demand processes  i wanted it primarily to play downloaded movies on the big flat screen i have in my sitting area  internet surf and access my huge calibre library of ebooks  it arrived well packaged  clean and ready to go  setup took virtually no time at all and the motor is very quiet  i can t hear it from 6 feet away  wireless is via a dongle rather than built in as other reviewers have noted  but it locked right in the first time and worked like a champ  no hdmi but vga is excellent  as of this writing  i literally cannot think of one negative thing to say about this  i got it for just under  100 and it s absolutely worth the price good computer  great price it is very basic and works great  i added my own keyboard and mouse and hit the ground running  i signed into my microsoft account and the computer configured appropriately  there was a price drop after i made the purchased  i am still very satisfied with the price i paid and the quality of the

primary one crashed  got this  and what a pleasant surprise  this machine runs as fast and as well as my primary 2 9 ghz dell  even though it s way older  it was easy to set up  easy to register the windows 10  and the wireless adapter works very well  i am thrilled with this purchase  and recommend getting one like this from blair to anyone  excellent customer service  easy setup instructions  they know what they re doing  couldn t be better what a deal i was greatly impressed with this computer for  100  from the time i opened the box  i was set up and on the internet within 15 minutes  i am new to windows 10 so that is taking a little bit to get used to  i use this computer for the sole purpose of making music  the program i run is gigantic in size  approx  20 gb  yet only took about an hour to download  the processor is not the fastest  however what do you expect for a  100 computer  if your expectations are realistic and don t do a great deal of gaming or video streaming  you will love this gem of a deal  the best part of this buy is that other reviewers stated that the wi fi was an external antennae  i don t know if i got lucky  but the cpu i got has an internal antennae great pcthe computer is just as described and works great  i had a dell precision 370 that this optiplex replaced  the optiplex actually came with 250g hd vs 80 which was advertised so thats a plus  the pc and windows 10 has worked great right out of the box which was very well packed   gonna upgrade ram to 8g and a 1t hd and be set good computer for what i needed it for good computer for what i needed it for  i have it set up as a video encoding machine running plex for the house  i just leave it on all the time and load all my movies through it  so far after 2 months it is running good best

this computer in hopes that it does not make chicken soup of the alphabet like the azulle did   i never heard of those guys    set the clock  and come back and the time is different  fanless   leave it on all the time  but had no disc drive   this one i can re install autocad and sink my teeth into an engineering project again   am so looking forward to including this computer into my daily life   am overjoyed great deal great deal five starsa ok
