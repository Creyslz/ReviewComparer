great_blender  excellent customer_service  i_bought_this_blender exactly 1 year ago and_i_am now writing my_review on it  i_never write reviews but my experience with ninja s customer_service was_so exceptional that_i felt compelled to write one  i_ll start by saying the_ninja is_an_excellent blender_for  70  i blend frozen_fruit with it every single day  it pulverizes everything_into_a smooth drink every_time  about 1 week ago  for_an unknown reason  my blender stopped_working  when_i_went to_turn it_on_the_power_button just started blinking instead  i_wasn_t sure what_this meant so_i emailed ninja  the representative was kind  attentive  and replied to_my emails extremely promptly  sometimes within minutes   i let him know_what happened  and all he asked me for was  1  the_blender model number 2  where_i_purchased_the_blender and_the approximate date of purchase 3  the_warranty number  which happens to_be just_a 4 digit number engraved on_the prongs which plug_in to_your electrical outlet  as soon_as_i_gave him that_information  he emailed me with_a confirmation of shipment of a_new pitcher along_with_a tracking number  the_new pitcher arrived_in 3 business days and my blender_is working like_new again  i_never figured out what_was wrong with_the_old pitcher or why_it_was preventing my blender from turning on   i_love companies that provide exceptional customer_service and_i_will never purchase another blender other_than ninja  thank_you ninja   blade housing   operator error  to all_the people giving this_blender a poor review because_they_were harmed by blades  popping out   the_blender lid locks in_and_the_lid itself has_a pouring spout that_you_are supposed_to_open to pour the drink or smoothie out with  personally i_like how easy it_is to_remove_the_blades  makes for_easy cleaning if_you_re making something more_than_a_smoothie where_you_have_to_take_the_entire lid off  you_can reach in  grab the head of_the_blade attachment and just easily pull the_blade out  it_s a_fantastic product_and you_can_t blame the_product for_a  design flaw  when_it_s simply operator error   smoothie magic  there_are_some products that just change your life  i_wanted_to_get in on_the smoothie thing  and_there_simply is_no other way_to_do_it than with_a_blender  and no better blender to_do_it with  the_blender_is mostly plastic  but_it_doesn_t feel cheap  it_is_very secure  it locks onto_the_base with_a satisfying click  the_lid locks down with_a similar click  unless_you_have heard both clicks  the_blender won_t start  and_good thing  the_blades_are_very sharp  they_are angled to create a vortex that_instantly turns any fruits_and vegetables inside into viscous liquid  i_like_that_the spout has_a lid that locks open so_you_can pour easily  the_blades come out so_that_they_can_be cleaned easily  along_with_the_inside_of_the decanter  i_saw that_another buyer was cut when the_blades  flew out  during cleaning  i_have looked carefully and my blade assembly does_not_appear to_be capable of flight or_even mild levitation  nonetheless i lift it_out carefully  and_if_i_am_going_to_use_the_blender again_i_just rinse the_blades  if_i_want the_blades completely clean i_use_the dishwasher and not my hands  it_has_been_a_long_time since_i_used_a_blender  i stopped because_they sucked  old blenders leaked out_the_bottom  they_were hard_to_clean  they had_a_ton_of different buttons for blending speed with labels that required a thesaurus next_to_the cookbook  and however_i parsed the gradations of perturbation between  emulsify  and  macerate   they didn_t actually blend  what_was_at_the_bottom_of_the_blender became_angry and confused while whatever was_in_the_top two thirds of_the decanter remained beatifically serene  this_blender has high  medium  and low settings  you_can pulse  it_is loud  which_i take to_be_a feature and not_a drawback  even more_than_my espresso machine  this_blender_is extremely effective at ending unwanted conversations  for particularly persistent interlocutors  use_the pulse setting  neither my_kids_nor i particularly like fruits_and vegetables and as_a result we don_t get nearly enough  and yet i_can put_in 10 bananas  two cartons of strawberries  two_of blueberries  a bag of spinach  yes  spinach    a cup of plain greek yogurt  one_interrupted conversation     and  ambrosia  the decanter is huge  and yet between_the three of us we can and do empty it_in_one meal  yay   amazing  i_was_a_little skeptical on spending so_much for_a_blender after_reading some_of_the_reviews that_said they had troubles with equipment failure  i_bought my_ninja with_a 4 year warranty for_about  11 for peace of mind  i_am glad_i_purchased_the_warranty  i_would hate for_anything to happen to_my_ninja  i_am loving it_so_far  i_ve_had_it_for_about_a_month and_i_make_a_smoothie about every other day  it_has helped tremendously for weight loss and eating healthier  it_s easy_to hide some healthy foods in_your smoothie and not_even notice them  my_favorite part_of_the_ninja has to_be how easy it_is to_set_up_and_clean  in total  the_ninja has 3 pieces   blender cup  blade and top   which_makes_it a_quick clean  the_blade comes out very_easily_and_i_can clean my_ninja in_about_a minute and reassemble it_in seconds  the_fact_that_it_s such_an easy set_up_and quick cleaning process leads me_to_keep making more_and more smoothies  i_have found_that peanut butter and_some heavier foods do tend_to stick to_the_side of_the_blender  but_for_the_most part  everything gets blended down really_nice  this_is my best purchase of_the summer  i_used_to_have_an old magic bullet and this blows it_out_of_the_water  i_would highly_recommend_this to_anybody who_is on_the fence of buying it   great_blender  i_was concerned buying_this_blender because_of some_of_the_reviews about blades popping out  so when the_blender came  i_was sure_to_be_very careful with_the_insides   to_my relief there_are many safety precautions on_this_blender to_make_sure that_the_blades stay on_the_inside  and once reading the_instructions all_my concerns went away  the locking lid and_easy pour top make_it_so_i_don_t need_to_remove_the_top when pouring smoothies  and when making salsa  the_first thing_i_do when the_top is removed is to_take_the_blades out  easy_to_clean  and remove   i_would purchase this_again   rivals the vitamix  at one fifth the_cost  this_is_a_great_blender that rivals my much_more_expensive vitamix  ive taken a break from_my vitamix 5200  which retails for 5 times the_cost_of_this_blender  to_test this_one out_for_a_week  i_love_it  it gives my vitamix a run for_the_money  here are_some observations  for chopping  this_blender_is impressive  it_looks so_much like_a food processor that_i_tried chopping an onion  and_got_acceptable results  i_would absolutely use_this for that   the vitamix cant do this_at_all   for ice crushing  yes  yes  yes  yes  snow_in blazingly fast time  sno cones  margaritas  whatever  this_blender has that_application covered  fantastic results  far better_than_the vitamix  for pulverizing  i_thought it_was_very_good  this_was the area that_the vitamix outshone the_ninja  but_i_think the_ninja did just_fine  in_my_homemade jalapeo coleslaw dressing  the_blender didnt quite get_all_the jalapeo pulverized  and_there_were little chunks_still in_the dressing  the_ninja had_a_little trouble pulverizing 2 large bunches of kale  and_i_had_to stop the_blender a_few times to_use_a scraper to_push_the leaves down  i_also needed_to_add some water to aid in_the blending  the leaves ended_up rather smoothly pulverized  although_i_dont think_they_were quite_as fine as_in_the vitamix  i_love_how the_blades remove completely from_the_pitcher every single time  it not_only makes_it easier_to scrape out all_the food from_the_blender_but_also to_get_it perfectly clean  the vitamix always ends up_with food stuck under the_blades  and_if_its something like hummus  its really hard_to_get_it clean  so the_design on_the_blades in_the_ninja is brilliant  be_careful  though  those blades_are sharp  i managed to to slice my hands open on two separate occasions while trying_to_put_them_in or take_them_out_of_the dishwasher  seriously  having tried this_blender  i_cant see recommending that_anyone spend the_extra money for_a vitamix  this_is_a_really_nice blender   love_it  this rascal will cut up_and pulverize      love_it  this rascal will cut up_and pulverize some frozen_fruit quick  the_pitcher connects quick to base with_one hand_also_the pour tap will lock in_the open position which_is helpful  cleanup is fast_and_easy but careful with_the_blade device pick up_and wash s l o w l y because_it_is_very sharp  we_had_a nutribullet and_the_power base went bad so after some_amazon shopping and a_lot_of reviews this_arrived 2 days later and_it_is preferred over_the previous device we_had  just_a_little history at no extra charge      my_wife and myself have chemo treatments and have found_that_it helps to self doctor if_you_can so_we_have_a_smoothie every_morning consisting of cottage cheese and flax seed oil  cancer killers  and_the taste is covered up_with_frozen_fruit  almond milk and a_good ripe banana  i added to let you_know_it_is used daily with great results compared_to infrequent use  hope this helps you make_a decision   i_like_it a bunch   i_used_to_use_a food processor but  being we_are a_small family  i_ve found_this_blender will do most everything my processor did  the_quality feels_great_and_it_s easy_to_clean_up  it_s my_favorite appliance these days   this_blender_is_a boss   for_the_last couple_of years  i_have_been making veggie smoothies  because_you_know  health  they_are gross  but necessary for_my health  in_the_past  it_would take me_at_least 5 6 minutes for_the smoothie to_blend in_my ol  trusty cuisinart  i_would_have_to stir and stir before magically  everything was blended to perfection  i_couldn_t justify spending      on_a_high dollar blender  because_it_s a_blender and_i d prefer to_spend my discretionary income on something more sustainable  like shoes  sarcasm   lately  my_old blender has_been heating up quickly_and_the_motor gives off_the  i_am_about_to die  smell  so  off i_went to_the great_internet highway_in search of blender reviews  i stumbled upon_this_blender and read_the review located near the_top  which made me chuckle  i_took the plunge and ordered it  wow  it_blends like_a freaking boss  it blended everything  avocado  spinach  bananas  blueberries  ice  other gross stuff  in seconds  no_longer will i_have_to retreat to_my spoon_arsenal to_get everything blended  this sucker blends like_a champ and_i_love_the pour spout  no green gross sad spinach stains on_my counter  hooray  if_you make_smoothies_and don_t want_to shell out big money  this_blender_is for_you  for_the_money  it_s a_great_deal   powerful  wow  this_blender_is magnificent  these blades will cut anything  i_bought_this mostly to_make pineapple hull juice and_it easily works_as_described  now_i_use_it_all_the_time  besides its power  this_blender_is beautifully designed   it_has_all sorts of security features  so_it_s impossible_to_screw things up   for_example  the_lid is_airtight and_has_a sensor click that_will prevent the_blender from turning on if_it_s open  there_is_also_a  power  button you must turn_on first  so_there_is_no risk of blending anything by accident or getting startled  oh  and_it_has_a_very obvious way of attaching the body to_the_base  remember those blenders you had_to_try a million_times to rotate the thing_into_the_base  and_still you weren_t_even sure_it_was securely attached   yea  not with_the_ninja  best purchase i_ve made in_a_while    great_blender  i_was contemplating breaking the bank and_buy the vitamix which_was like  400  so glad that_i_gave this_one a try instead  not stating the obvious money saving  but unless_you_want_to_make soup_without_the stove or_some crazy stuff  this_blender_is_an_excellent choice  we pulverized ice to_make snow cone_in no time  fruits_and vegis gets blended into smoothly nicely  love_the_product  just be_careful when cleaning the_blades  they_are_very sharp   i_do love_this_thing  i_do love_this_thing  this_is my second_one  it_does the_job of a vitimix for_a fraction of_the_cost  the drawback with_this particular model is_that_if a part breaks  the_lid broke on_my_first_one   replacement parts are hard_to come by  and_if_you_do want a_replacement  it_will_be cheaper to_buy the_entire unit than_the part  ninja has so_many different versions of_this_thing and_the parts are usually not interchangeable  but  aside from that  it_works_great   best blender_i_ve_used    i_love_my_ninja and absolutely cannot say enough about_it  first off_the_power of it_is_amazing compared_to all_the_other blenders i_ve_used such_as oyester  black_and decker  and a_couple others  it_s power is far stronger than_all_the_others i_ve_used  but what s more amazing about_it_is_that_it_s so_much quieter than_the_others  it_s a win  win situation for sure  this_blender_is_also_a food processor_so the range of things that_can_be done with it_is limitless  i enjoy juicing fruits_and vegetables  but don_t_like typical juicers because_it throws away all_the pulp  and that_is where_the vast majority of nutrients are  with_the_ninja i_get_the_best quality_of fresh juices  smoothies  and protein drinks  i_also really enjoy making my baby s food  and with_the_ninja it truly makes_it a_breeze  only the_best for_my little one  i_have_also made soup_with it by blending my steamed veggies and_then heated on_the stove  the cleanup is_so_much_easier than_any_other blender_i_ve_used_as_well  i_have_been_using my_ninja for_already 5 months_and_it_works_like_a charm  this_product_is_something_i_would_recommend to_anyone   tons of room and power  after years of using_and burning out cheap blenders i_finally decided_to upgrade to this quality blender and_i_am so  so glad_i_did  this_has_a_very_sturdy base which does_not shift while blending  the_carafe locks into_place with ease and_does_not shift at_all while blending either  the_lid also locks into_place and_does_not move while blending or pouring so_there_is_no need_to_hold_the_top_of_the_blender while_it_is going  the_carafe holds a_ton_of stuff as_well so fewer batches are needed when pureeing large recipes such_as soup  the_blades_are super sharp_and slide into_place quickly_and easily  they_are_not mounted to_the_bottom  similar to a food processor blade  so_it_is easiest to_keep the_lid on_and pour through_the pour hole on_the_corner and_then remove_the_lid and blade unit_for washing afterwards  contrary to_other_reviews_it_does_not  pop out  for no reason  it_does  however  fall_out_if_you hold_the_unit_upside down with_the_lid off  due_to gravity   this_is incredibly powerful as_well  i_very rarely need_to process anything for_more_than 30 seconds_no_matter what_it_is  i puree soups and make_smoothies_and milkshakes all_in under thirty seconds of blending  ice simply gets eaten up_and_there_are no large chunks as_i_ve found with other_brands and models  i_also use_this to puree food scraps for_my worm composting unit and_it fully purees a_full carafe of eggplant peels  pepper insides  and celery ends  along_with_some water  into_a v8 consistency in thirty seconds  overall  this_is one_of_the_best additions to_my kitchen this year_and worth every single penny  i_highly  highly_recommend_it   frozen_fruit_smoothies  no_problem  smooth  ninja lives up_to_the hype   smoothies are smooth  the_unit_works_as_advertized  appears_to_be_an_excellent product  i make_my_smoothies_with_frozen_fruit which_is_very hard on blenders  this did a_great job of converting the frozen_fruit to a smooth consistency with_no chunks or uncut pieces  it_did_not_appear to strain  the question is  will it hold_up_to_doing this day after day  i_am betting the answer is yes  the_design_is_quite good  i_bought_this_unit to_replace a breville that_had died from hacking one too many bags of frozen strawberries  where breville makes_a beefy brute force machine that hacks the fruit  the_ninja is_a smart design that cuts  as_another commenter mentioned  the stacked blades_are_ingenious  the_blades appear flimsy but_their shape and sharpness does_not expose them_to forces that might harm them_so_they appear to_be up_to_the task  the_blade stack reaches all_the_way_to_the_lid and this_is one_of_the_design innovations  by having_a bearing in_the_lid it dramatically reduces the lateral torque on_the_main bearing thus allowing it to_be much smaller  smart and efficient means less stress on components and less power is required  this_is_why_i anticipate it_will last longer despite weighing about 1 3rd of what_my_old breville boat_anchor weighed  and_it costs about 1 4 what_it_would to_replace my breville with_an equivalent model  designed for_the_internet age  light so shipping is in expensive  clever design so_that_it_is exposed to less wear_and tear  hope to_be back_in_a_year with_a glowing report of long life  watch out_for_the_blades  this_is_a rare case where razor sharp really means razor sharp handle with care or you_will get cut  i suspect the lifetime of_this_blender_is mostly dictated by how_long the_blades remain sharp   must_have blender recipe  2 oz white rum  don q cristal   1 oz coco lopez coconut cream  1 oz heavy cream  6 oz pineapple juice  1 cup of ice  1 spoonful of unsweetened coconut shreds  put_aforementioned ingredients only in_a ninja_blender on_medium blend for 11 seconds  garnish with_a cherry  pineapple and cocktail umbrella and blaaaam  a_perfect pina freakin colada brah  very_good blender    very_good blender  it meets all expectations  with_the cutting system of several blades allows to grind up_to_the ice  it_is_a robust blender  the use_is_easy and safe  it_is_not heavy  the jar is_made_of_plastic  the_lid has several opening systems that make_it_easy_to_use  the_price benefit ratio is_excellent  the_packaging box is_excellent  the_seller made the shipment on_time_and_the_product was received on_time  the_product arrived_in_good condition   worth_the_money  best blender_i_ve_ever had   i_purchased_this_blender a_few_months_ago  i_was hesitant to_spend the_extra money for_a ninja  since_i_usually purchase oster or black_and decker blenders  but_this_was such_a_great decision  the_blades going up the_entire blender makes_it_so_much_easier for_my_smoothies to_turn out consistent  especially since_i_use frozen_fruits  and_it_blends rediculously fast  i make_smoothies daily and_i_won_t ever buy_another brand  the_price_was seriously worth_the splurge since_i_use_it constantly   and this looked good  i_liked the_description_about_the technology to      i_am_a diehard vitamix person  but wanted_a_second blender to_keep where_i rent in_the winter  i_did_not want_to_spend the_money for_another vitamix  and this looked good  i_liked the_description_about_the technology to crunch ice  because that_was_my biggest challenge with  regular  blenders  i_use_a_lot_of ice in_my shakes  this_blender_is_awesome  crunches the ice with ease  i probably will never get_a vitamix again  as this_is_just_as_good_but_for_a_much_better price   this_thing_is_a marvel of smart design and high_quality precision manufacturing  this_thing_is_a marvel of smart design and high_quality precision manufacturing  they_do_not lie   fill it with ice cubes  run it and you_get snow  because_it_has blades top to bottom this baby kicks out my breakfast smoothie in less_than_a minute  everything_is_good  the poor spout stays open when pouring by magnets or magic  i_can_tell but_it_stays up  yet never opens when blending  the_pitcher locks onto_the_motor logically and effortlessly  clean_up is_easy  warm water and a drop of soap  run on high for_a minute and rinse  done  it_s even really_easy_to_clean_the_base  sealed and wipe able all_around  bummed i_didn_t get_one_of_these long ago       month or two now_and_so_far it_s been perfect  i mostly use_it to_make_smoothies but      i_ve_been_using_this_blender_for_a_month or two now_and_so_far it_s been perfect  i mostly use_it to_make_smoothies but have_used_it_for other recipes as_well  it_s_not the_most powerful but_it definitely gets the_job_done more_than enough   awesome  i_have_had_a basic blender_forever  i_have wanted one_of_these_for_a_long_time  finally got_it  this_is_a_great_blender  it_isn_t as loud   easy_to_assemble and_clean  there_were some reviews that mentioned the_blade popped out when pouring the contents  the_instructions clearly state leave the_lid on  it holds the_blade in_place   and_use_the pouring spout  if contents too thick  remove lid  and blade  you_can grab it_safely from_the_top   and_then pour out  just read_the_instructions before you_use_it     i_love_it    i_was_looking_for_a vitamix alternative when_i came      i_was_looking_for_a vitamix alternative when_i came_across this_blender  when_i_was trying_to_make crushed ice  it_was_so strong  it turned the ice into snow    the_blades_are_also very sharp as_i cut myself trying_to_clean_the_blender   super     i_love_this_blender   it_works_great   other_reviews stated that_they got hurt using_this_blender or cleaning it  but_if_you close the_lid properly and pour your shake into_a cup through_the_top  secured  opening  then_you_will_be just_fine     and to_clean it  just make_sure_you carefully take_the_blades out_and wash that_separately  if_you follow these steps  then_i promise that_you_will_be injury free    definitely_recommend_this_blender     4 years_and_still_going strong   ive_had my_ninja for nearly four years_and_its_still_going strong  my average use_is_about_3 times week  it_still blends_great  ive_never_had the_plastic break  ive_never been cut by_the_blades  handle it with care and youll definitely get your_moneys worth out_of_this investment   great purchase  i_never thought i d get excited over_a_blender  how did i live so_long without this_thing  it_is well designed  easy_to_clean  i_like_the_way_the_blades_are held in_place by_the_lid which_makes_them easy_to_remove  it_is powerful  and with three blades  blends in_a snap  wish_i_had purchased_this years ago     better_than_a normal blender  so_much_better_than_a normal blender  really gets everything_into_a liquid state quickly  easier_to_use_and_clean than_a food processor  i_use_it_for fresh fruit_smoothies almost daily  no_problem handling ice cubes or sticky ingredients like_almond butter  just_have_to_take care cleaning the removable center stem with six very sharp blades on it  it_s taller than our blender was  so_we actually can_t push_it_up against the_wall under the cabinet  so_we store it with_the_blender jar removed   great_for_smoothies   after my_old blender gave up the ghost  i_got_this  i_was_a_little skeptical because_of_the_plastic canister    but man is this_thing awesome  i_love_the_power and_the_design_is_perfect   the tall blade unit_is_easy_to_take out_and_clean  frozen smoothie stuff never gets stuck or needs stirring like my_old blender  i_didn_t use_my_old blender as_much as_i_would_have liked  because_it_was such_a hassle to_get smoothies pureed to_the_right consistency  but my_kids and_i_have_been_using_this ninja every_morning now for_a_couple_of weeks   this_is the_best blender_i_have_had  i_have_used_this_now for_a_few_months before writing a_review  this_is the_best blender_i_have_had  i_can_t afford the vitamix  so_i_bought_this  i juice protein_powder with_frozen_fruit almost everyday now  and only because_this makes_it_so_easy  blends ice water frozen_fruit_and powder so_well  my_husband loves me having it because we both benefits with_the protein drinks  this_is_and affordable amazing blender   can you_really be in love with_your blender     yes  oh my yes   we_are_in love with our ninja_blender  it_will blend anything and_it_is_so safe and_easy_to_clean  the_design_is incredible  my_husband blends smoothies_with protein_and frozen_fruit_and_i_used_to dread_the mess he made  the_ninja comes apart in such_a way that_it_is_easy_to_clean_and_the_blades lift out  i_love_the safety handle  you_cannot take of_the_lid with_the_ninja in motion_and trust me this_is_a_good thing  the_blades_are_so sharp  caution when cleaning blades  use_a_long dish washing brush to_clean instead_of a sponge or rag because_of_the sharpness and shape of_the_blades  don_t leave them around small children   adopt a ninja today   it_is_as strong as_it_looks  that_s for sure  i_loved it  it_s easy_to_clean  and_i_loved the safety feature  it_also_has_a_very soft lock system  and you only need_to_clean 3 things  the jug  the_lid and_the easily removable blades  there_s_no rubber blade plastic combo that takes hours to dry out or smells like baby vomit  no  just one long set_of blades in hard plastic  omg   o i_only_had cheap blenders before this   a whole life of regret     i_love_this_blender  prior to_ordering this ninja_blender  i_had_been_using_another  it_was heavy  glass  with_a sort_of vintage y vibe  after receiving and using_the bl610  i_don_t know_what took_me so_long  i_love_this_blender  it_s thorough  quick  and simple to_use  i_love_that_it blinks when_it_s plugged in but_the_lid isn_t on correctly  super_easy_to_clean  too  i_ve_been tons of things with_this_thing    from salsas to smoothies  my_only_advice would_be to_make_sure_to_take_the_blade out before pouring  and be_careful when hand washing  or just picking up  the_blade   margaritas forever  nothing worse than having your old blender die right in_the_middle of a batch of margaritas  my_son had_been singing the praise of his blender so_i_decided_to_order one up  glad_i_did  this_thing creates incredible ice shavings which are excellent for making adult snow cones  as_well as kiddy versions  and_it_also blends up mean margaritas with only_a_few seconds of blending  unit_is well constructed and_the features were well designed  easy pouring lid  locking top  clear controls with_good sized buttons  easy grip handle   you won_t be disappointed_with_this_unit   powerful blender  easy_to_use_and_clean    great_for frozen drinks alcohol included  and smoothies   i_always wanted_a powerful blender_but all_of_them are_so expensive  anyway  i bumped into this_one and when_i_saw the_reviews_and_the_price       i_said_i_can_t say no to this  i_am very_happy_with_this  as soon_as_it_arrived  2or 3 days maybe  i_wash it  and_the_first thing_i_did was to_do the ice test of_course    hmmm  frozen strawberry margaritas  smothies  etc  well  with_a_little_bit_of noise  my dog ran away_to_my_daughter s room  it passed the ice test  in seconds i_had crushed ice  the_next step was to instruct my_daughter to never ever put her hands inside_the container  no_matter what  even if_is_not on  she looked at me with big open eyes    yes never  these_are extra sharp blades  this morning i prepared my_first smoothie  kale  carrots  pear  honey  banana and_ice  i_will_not say the drink is delicious  but_the_blender did his job  in seconds all_the fruits_and veggies were crushed and blended  you_will_not_be disappointed  go_for it  easy_to_use  powerful_and_easy_to_clean   ninja professional blender  this_is without_the_best blender_for_the_money period  in_the_past i_have_used from waring to kitchen aid and none_of_them crushed ice like_this_blender does  brought it_for_smoothies_and protein drinks  consistency is like_at_a juice bar  well_worth_the_money  five_stars  makes_great smoothies   couldn_t be_happier  this_is how_much i_love_this_blender    i included it when loading the_car with_a_few belongings prior to evacuating for hurricane irma  it completely delivers on_all its promises  there_are multiple warnings about handling the_blades  and_they_are_indeed sharp  i_don_t_have_a dishwasher and hand washing the_blade is painstaking  so_i_ve started filling the jar half up_with soapy water and_running it on low to swish clean_the_blades  works_great   what_a joy   my mother who lives with us needs to_have her food pureed now  the_blender we_had could_not handle pureeing many of our usual food items  after some research i_decided_to_try the_ninja professional blender  bl610   now most_evenings when mom smells dinner cooking she can look forward to enjoying the_same freshly prepared meal we_are having  what_a joy   new generation design shows how far we ve come_with_a_blender  sturdy  well designed blender that_an grind anything without breaking a sweat  easier than_anything_i_have seen prior to_clean as_you easily remove_the_blades and_clean_the_inside very quickly  blades just wash off_and that_s good because_they_re sharp beyond description  and_the_design of_the_lid is genius  really_like_the_way_it locks into_place on_the_base so_you_don_t get partial engagement of_the driving gear  nice design  good_value_for money   frappe anyone    the_instructions are clear  turns ice into_anything frosty that_you_can_think of  do you_have_any idea how_much starbucks charges for_a coffee slush  it_s paid_for itself twice over_already  i m in love    great_and very affordable   first of_all  this_is my_first blender that_was manufactured later than_the 70s  thanks mom for_the hand me down osterizer   i_am_a product of_the 80s  so yeah  obviously  much improved  i_ve_been excited to_get up this past week to_make_my coffee smoothies before work  it_is loud  i hope that_my neighbor doesn_t hear it_downstairs  but_i_don_t know_if_there_is such thing as_a_blender that_can quietly chop up ice  one_of_my cats watches me prep my smoothie but runs when_i turn it on  and_the_other cat runs over to_see what_is making that noise  so_it_s tolerable for_a non fraidy cat  i_ve read reviews of complaints that_the_blade doesn_t snap in_and people have cut their hands  so_i_was nervous about that  but_i sat down_and read_the instruction manual all_the_way through and_it_states it a bunch of_times that_the_blade doesn_t snap in_and to lift it_out before you pour with_the_lid off  so_i_ve paid very close attention to that  always be sure_to_read instructions  reviews have complained that_the_blender somehow broke within weeks of purchasing it  if_you_read_the_instructions  you_ll see to register it within 10 days and_they_have_a one year warranty  i_highly_recommend_this_blender and_it_s super affordable  my mom said her vitamix heats up whatever she puts in it  so_i_was worried my smoothie might come out warm  but_it_stays cold  maybe it_s a_better blender_for 1 4 of_the_cost  pro tip  from mom   after using  fill the_blender with warm water a_little_bit away_from_the_top with_a_tiny amount_of dish soap and run on high and_it_washes out_the_pitcher      scary powerful_and fast  intense you guys got_it_right  totally more intense powerful machine then my oster  really fast  great clever safety features to prevent injury from large blade  much_better machine than_expected  unfortunately it_did_not create a fine creamy shake  the shakes were coarse in texture with chips and pieces  no_longer how_long it ran  my oster took longer but produces a_much much finer creamier result   good blender   great_for_smoothies  so_far so_good  great_for_smoothies  having the_blades along a shaft from bottom to top_of pitcher seems_to result in faster more efficient action when compared_to models with blades only_at_the_bottom  the_pitcher is fairly large so_if_you only want_to_do one serving at_a time you might consider similar models that_include the_option of individual serving containers  i prefer this size to_make_a_full batch and keep second or third servings for_another day or two without_any apparent loss of freshness  you_do need_to_be_careful in handling the_blade shaft especially when washing by hand or reassembling   the_blades_are_very sharp   arrived_in perfect working order everything well_packaged  arrived_in perfect working order everything well_packaged  i m 30 so_i_ve seen a_lot_of blenders over_the years  this_blender_is one_of_the_best i_ve_used_and_i_ve only_had_it_in_my_home for_a_few hours  first and fore most the_lid locks down_and may_be trusted not to pop off  second  the_blades_are_not locked in_place making removal easy  third  and sadly the_only flaw i_don_t recommend_this_blender_for ice   it_s wonderful  does everything_i_ve_ever asked it to   i_ve_been putting this_blender through its paces with_a chutney recipe that requires blending fresh ginger  which my_previous blender failed at miserably  wow  is this ninja ever a star  it_also_has several layers of very sharp blades  which cuts down_on_time  one_of_the_best features is_that_if_you_don_t_have it_securely put_together it won_t run  it_s easy_to_use  easy_to_clean  blades and container are dishwasher friendly  and_the_lid usually only requires a soapy water rinse   and_works_like  well  a ninja  you_will_not go wrong with_this_blender   works_as_advertised   in_addition_to_being the real deal  the_unit_has_a number_of safety features which will ensure family members do_not_get hurt or make_another mess for_me_to_clean_up  the container has to_be  screwed  into_the_base unti  the cap has to_be locked in_place  if one_of_these do_not occur  the_power light flashed indicating something_is wrong  under this condition  the_unit_will_not run  i_like_it   no_more hammers or mess  just_got_it today  to_test it  i_put_in_the ice from_a whole 2 ice cube trays to_see what_it_could do  15 seconds later  i_had_all_the ice shavings  and more  than_i_needed  now  i_ve to_figure_out a way_to_store the shavings so_they_re still crushed ice  but_if don_t  it ll only take 15 second  or less  to_have the crushed ice you alway wanted    and_now that_s it_s summer    how good does that_sound   way_too_much fun   i_can not explain how_much i_love_my_new blender  yes the_blades_are extremely sharp  and_i_would advise anyone to_be_careful with_them  when washing them  other_than that_the_motor is big_and powerful_and crushes anything within seconds  it_is_pretty loud so  i_would advise you to_make_smoothies or whatever it_is  when everyone_is up  so_that_you_do_not disturb them   powerful  fast_and makes effortless perfect smoothies    finally  i_can make_a_quick easy smoothie   effortlessly  its powerful   does the_job in seconds  i_dont have_to_take_the_lid off 10 times during_the process to shove the ice or fruit_down lower towards the_blades to_make_sure_it_all gets in  this pulls everything together on its own and you_have_a_perfect smoothie within seconds to a minute  the_blade isnt the typical small little attached piece on_the_bottom  its_a_long blade that_is removeble   which_makes_the_whole process much_easier and blends evenly  no_more shoving it_all to_the_bottom   love_it  easy_to_assemble  easy_to_clean  3 pieces   you_can_toss it_right in_the dishwasher when_you_are done   a_blender that lives up_to_the hype  since receiving it a_week ago i_ve_used_it to_make_smoothies every_morning  not_only does_it quickly_and efficiently pulverize ice  greens  and frozen_fruit_in moments but_it mixes ingredients well   no chunks of protein_powder or_almond butter left untouched  the pour spout_on_the_lid is key to easy transfer to_your glass  it completely eliminates the risk of smoothie ending up all_over_the counter  it_s also really_easy_to_clean  i take_the_blades out_immediately after use_and rinse them clean in seconds  sometimes i leave the_rest to soak during_the_day with_some soapy water and when_i_get home later in_the_day_it just needs a rinse and_any sticky residue washes away easily  can_t recommend_this_blender enough   very_happy   we use_this mixer for_smoothies   love_it  this beats any standard blender  just be sure_to_clean_up right after your done and_it_s very_easy_to_keep clean  the super sharp blades slice frozen_fruit   ice   bolts  just kidding    but_in_any case  the_blender_is_awesome  this_is our second_one  we used_to own an older model and_the_only_reason we needed_a_new_one_was the_old_one fell off_the counter and broke the container  manufactured solid and with_good_quality parts   amazing   best blender_i ever had   so powerful  looks_very_nice_and modern  cuts through ice like bananas  blends smoothies in seconds  i_love_the mutiple level blades  love_the squarish pitcher  very_easy_to_clean  good safety features  pour spout_is usefull  extremly good_product_and atleast half the_price_of its competition  professional quality forsure  make you_just wanna bleand_something  lol   love  love  love  love  love_this  make smooth smoothies using many ingredients  makes_a head of caulflower rice in 3 pulses  use_it_all_the_time   recommended  with three sets of blades  not just one set on_the_bottom  this_blender does a_nice job making smoothies  the_lid locks on to_the_pitcher and_the_pitcher locks onto_the_base  remember the_old days when_we would keep our hand on_the_lid when blending  just in_case  no need here  there_are three power settings  low  medium  and high  it_also_has pulse  for cleaning  the center piece with_the_blades comes out easily  i_put_the_pitcher  blades  and lid in_the dishwasher  we ve_been_using_this for six months_now_and_we re very_pleased   simple professional grade blender with_affordable price  for_the_price  this_is_no doubt an_excellent blender  i_love to_blend smoothies as meal substitute  the multi blades feature is_great  all i_have_to_do_is stuff in_all_the ingredients and turn it on  30 seconds later i_will_have_my finely blended smoothies ready  no_more problem_with ingredients stuck in_the_middle  some_people mention in_the review that_they_have problem_with_the detachable blade  but_i_can only think of one scenario that_would cause such problem  which_is press the release button while_the_blender_is blending  the_blender has_a locking mechanism on_the_lid  the_blender cannot start without_the_lid close and locked  just need_to_be_careful not to unlock the_lid while blending  and make_sure the_lid is secured before start  i personally love_the removable blade  it_is_so_easy_to_clean_and dry  i_had so_much problem_with_my_old blender when the_blade got dirty  but_not_anymore  this_blender design_is_very_well thought  practical  powerful  and_easy_to maintain  with_this_affordable price_and performance of a professional blender  you_just cannot_ask for_more   this_is the_blender you ve_been looking_for   this_is the_blender_i_was_looking_for  i_wanted something better_than_the  25 35 oster  hamilton beach or black   decker  but_i_didn_t want or need the expensive breville or vitamix  it_s multi blade spindle makes quick work of fruit or ice  blending everything completely  an extremely simple control panel   low  medium and high  plus pulse   what more could anyone want  do be warned  the_blades_are crazy sharp   but_i clean mine the_way_i_ve cleaned every blender_i_ve_ever owned   adding a_few drops of dish soap and_some warm or hot water to_the_blender jar  run it_for_a_few seconds and rinse it_out  only handle the_blade spindle by_the very top_and you_will never lose another drop of blood   this_thing_is_great  it rips up frozen_fruit like nothing  man  this_thing_is_great  it rips up frozen_fruit like nothing  used_to_have_to warm up the frozen_fruit before blending  no such problem now   best bang_for_your buck  i_purchased_this due_to_the_price_point and_good reviews_in hopes that_it performed just_as_good_as the  350  500 blenders  i_have_to_say_that_it_has outdone itself proving that_it_takes little to no effort blending up my_smoothies on_a daily basis  i_would_definitely_recommend_this compared_to_the more_expensive blenders  take_the_rest_of_the_money that_you save after buying_this to_purchase other needed_appliances   ice beware          this_will conquer you  i_love_this_blender  the 9cup capacity is far more practical than_the lesser 6 cup blender distant cousins  it_will_be perfect_for margarita time  three blades to_blend whatever the hell you shove down in_there  the_lid locks into_place as does the_pitcher  no_more blender mishaps with_the ill fitting  flimsy lids     a_solid blender that makes_a fine addition_to all_the kitchen gadgets that one needs for_a_good time   my key to healthier eating  love_this_blender  incredible with_frozen_fruit_and_invigor8 protein  health mix   so_happy i_chose this_blender  i_had_an older osterizer blender and a nutribullet    the osterizer was_ancient and started leaking at_the_bottom by_the_blade  wouldn_t blend my_smoothies_without frequent stiring  and_i_hated unscrewing the_pieces to_clean it  the nutribullet needed_to_be stirred to_blend as_well  and was even worse  i_had issues_with leaking with it as_well  i personally want my_smoothies a_smoothie consistency not_a watery drink  this_blender_is_perfect_for_me  it_has_a_lot_of great features and was obviously made with convenience in_mind at every step  we_are protein  health shake junkies  for_our smoothies we mix invigor8 smoothie powder in with water  frozen_fruits  and vanilla yogurt  these smoothies taste like desert and_the ability to_make them thicker in_a_blender like_this_is incredible  i_am one_of_those people that never outgrew the_issue_with chunks and_weird textures in_my food  this_blender successfully blended my thick smoothie to perfection  for_those_who haven_t tried it  buy some invigor8 and_use_it_in smoothies_with_this_blender    they_have chocolate and vanilla  so_good and extremely healthy  if_you like chocolate    the brownie invigor8 mix with_frozen banana  a_little frozen strawberry  some water  and_some vanilla yogurt literally tastes like_a banana split  this_blender_is my key to healthier eating and_i_am in love   efficient  easy_to_clean  powerful  loud  this performs like_new even_though_it_s refurbished  the three tiers of blades_are excellent for large volume blending  the_unit_is large but_not bulky  the_cord wrap area on_the_back_of_the_motor housing is_very convenient  i enjoy how everything locks into_place   the blending container onto_the_base and_the_lid onto_the container  it_s very_easy_to_clean because_the_blades come out all at once easily without_any weird holes or needing to root around_the_bottom_of a_blender with_a sharp object  i imagine there_is_no quiet blender_but being that_this_one_is powerful  it_s ridiculously loud   easy_to_clean  powerful_and efficient at blending  there_are 5 thing_i_love in particular about_this_unit compared_to_other blenders that_i_ve_used before  1  fantastic power that ll cut through anything frozen that_i toss in 2  the three pairs of blades at low  middle and high heights inside completely eliminates the need_to_use_a spoon halfway through blending to_push down a top layer of un blended material  this immensely adds to_the speed at which_i_can blend  3  the_volume of 72oz is_very generous and allows me_to_better make_a gallon pitcher of watermelon juice for_example 4  the_plastic construction is_very durable and eliminates the need for_any gaskets that_can potentiate leaks like is glass blenders  the simplicity of_the removable blade  which_makes_it easier_to_replace if_it were to_break or wear down  and a_single lid also makes this_very_easy_to_clean  just put_in some water and soap  run the_blender_for_a_few seconds  and rinse out after  5  small detail  but_i_very much appreciate that_there_is_a way_to wrap to cord  like on_a vacuum cleaner  on_the_back side  instead_of on_the_bottom or_not_at_all   this helps reduce its footprint on_my counter top where_i_like to_keep_it   will easily stand up_to_the vitamix  yes  this_is the_blender of_all blenders  easy_to_clean  easy_to_set_up  easy_to pour  easy_to_turn_on_and_use  forget_the vitamix because_this_blender_is_just_as_good  trust me  my aunt has_a vitamix and this_is exactly the_same for_a_small fraction of_the_price   warning  the_blade in_the center is_not fixed onto_the_blender jar  it it loose so be_careful when_you open_and reach in_there  i_read another review that_said a man was cut and he blamed the_blender  sorry  no  the_blade won_t  jump out  at you but_it_is loose  with that being said  yes  yes to this_blender  you_need_it  you_ll regret not_getting it  thick plastic jar  click release lid  pour spout  3 settings  low  med  high   measurements on jar and a twist lock to secure jar to base  this_blender_is_awesome_at chopping ice  making dough  salsa  smoothies_and_iced coffee   get_this today  
owned 6 weeks  i_m_a healthcare professional and bought_this_after researching the competition  i e    vita mix   after_reading through a gazillion comments and reviews  including cr who rates the_ninja  2  i opted for_the_lower priced ninja  i_have_used mine twice a_day for_the 6 weeks i_have_owned it  i_use_it_for making smoothies  i blend for health  i_have_a morning fruit_and berry smoothie and_i_have_an afternoon veggie smoothie  blending is_a_really convenient way_to_get in_all your servings of fruit_and veggies each day without removing the  very important  fiber  so_far  i_love_my_ninja  i_have_had stuff made with_a vita mix in_the_past  but have_never done a side by side comparison  though_i_can_think of a_few differences that_are meaningful for_me  one  the vita mix generates heat  they use_it as_a selling feature  that_you_can use_it to_make soups  but_i_like my_smoothies cold  so_it_s_not_something_i look for in_a_blender  secondly  vita mix seems_to win in_all_the comparisons with ninja on smoothness  or thoroughness of blending  the_only_reason i knocked one_star off_the_ninja is_because_i_have_noticed that_my_smoothies are a_bit chewier after several weeks of blender use  i attribute that to_the_fact_that ninja relies  apparently  on_their sharp blades  which naturally dull with use especially when blending frozen berries or ice  which both of_my_smoothies contain   i_ve noticed a subtle change in texture  no chunks  but definitely not_a fine blend  my understanding is_that vita mix has dull blades that_work_for_years  they_do_not rely so_much on sharpness as_they_do on speed  the_other thing  in_addition_to heat  that_you_get with_a vita mix is_aeration  foam   which_i_do_not notice with_the_ninja  my_smoothies are full of fruit_and veggies  so_they_are full of fiber  if_you_are okay with having some noticeable fiber in_your blend over time  the_ninja is_a_great_deal at_about 1 5 the_cost  if that matters to you  expect that_you_will_have it_in time  i_started_to notice it after_about 25 blends   the_blender cleans very_easily_and_is simple to_use  i_ve_never_had_to_remove_the_top to tamp stuff down_and_i_use 3 cups of leafy greens like kale and arugula  as_well as whole carrots  celery  apples  and never have chunks  overall_it_s a_great machine  i_cannot rate longevity since_i_ve only_had_it 6 weeks  but so_far i_m_very_pleased  update  it_s january 2018  i owned the_ninja about_3_months_and ended_up getting_a vita mix  i_still stand by my original review  but_there_is_a difference  the_ninja starts out pretty great  but_then over time things do no blend as_well  i drink 2 smoothies a_day  one veggie  one fruit   so_i_use_it a minimum of 2x a_day  over time_i_started calling my_ninja_smoothies   grainies   the_blades start out very sharp  and_the technology depends on that  but_they dull with use_and_it_shows in_the results  the vita mix does_not depend on blade sharpness  but power  it pummels everything to pieces  itty bitty pieces   i_am_amazed at_the flour i_can make with it  also  the heat i mentioned is_not_a factor but a feature  most things are blended in less_than_a minute  35 seconds often   so_nothing really gets warm unless_you leave it on in_order to generate heat  the_ninja is_a_good blender  especially_for_the_cost  but_i_don_t_think one can fairly compare it to a vita mix  it_s like comparing apples and oranges   easy_to_clean_and_does the_job   i_like_the_blender  it_does the_job but  i_wish_it blended things like spinach a_little_bit more finely  the_blades don_t quite get far enough_to_the edge and little_bits seem_to escape the_blades  this_is_a_very minor complaint  i_also find it annoying that_the_lid needs to latch on while_the blending is in progress  sometimes i_like to_add ingredients after the blending has commenced  my_old blender had_a removable center on_the_lid to_do just this_and_i definitely miss that feature  on_the positive  its so_easy_to_clean  the_fact_that_the_blade comes out makes_all_the_difference in_the_world   i_love_this_blender  i_love_this_blender  it_s easy_to_use_and_easy_to_clean  this_is my_first blender and_i_didn_t_even have_to_read_the_instructions to_figure_out how_to_use_it  sometimes when_it begins to_blend  pieces of fruit vegetables stick to_the glass  such_as_a spinach leaf  and you_have_to_turn it off_and push_the piece_of fruit vegetable back down_to_blend  but_that_s my_only  issue  so_far  it creates smooth smoothies  i_ve_been_using_it twice a_day for two weeks_now   impressive ice crusher and smoothie maker  just wish_it_was compatible with individual blending cups   we ve_been battling our blender s ability to crush ice for_years  since our kiddos are huge smoothie fans and_we enjoy frozen drinks  we needed_a_blender that could get_the_job_done without leaving chunks of ice and a metallic smell in_the air  after_reading the stellar reviews_and watching the impressive ice crushing infomercial  we decided_to invest in_a ninja  when this particular model had_a flash sale   53 49   we pulled the trigger  pros  1  it crushes ice and frozen_fruit like_a powerhouse  leaving no chunks behind  2  the_blade design_is brilliant  easy_to insert and remove with_one fluid movement   just don_t forget to_put blade in before blending   3  blade removal makes pouring  scraping  and_cleaning easy   be_careful  it_s sharp   4  secured top system locks out leaks and splashes  5  flip spout allows small food items and liquid to_be_added while blending  6  has the ability to pulse or run blender hands free  7  holds a_ton_of liquid  great_for lots_of people  cons  1  if_not full  dry items  spinach  will jump to_the_top_and stick to_the_sides requiring stopping and stirring manually  2  does_not pair with individual blending cups as recommended by amazon  3  cord_is_too short  difficult_to accommodate to outlet  given the  54 price tag  this_blender_is well_worth_the_money when entertaining and blending for groups  it_gets the_job_done quickly_and efficiently and crushes ice like magic  cleanup is_easy   simply rinse the extremely sharp blade and air dry on counter and throw the_pitcher in_the dishwasher  because_of_the excellent top lock feature and no openings on pitcher base  little to no residue gets on_the_base  i_love_this_blender  but_if_i_had_it to_do_all_over_again  i_would bypass this model and order an all_in_one ninja_blender that has the_option of using smaller cups for individual drinks  our smoothie blending would take much less time_if_the area inside_the_pitcher cup was filled with more food liquid so_that_sides didn_t need_to_be scraped of spinach  plus  we d have the added individual smoothie cups for_our two children  allowing them_to choose the ingredients inside  while_they_re battling over smoothie choices  my_husband_and_i_could enjoy blending frozen margaritas_in_a_bigger pitcher  amazon   please stop pairing it with_the  tritan nutri ninja cups   they_re not compatible with_this_unit  bottom line  ninja packs a punch i_ve_never seen with other blenders  it_s my_new brand of choice   blends nicely  but need_to_be cautious with blade   we needed_to_replace our old blender and_i_didn_t want_to_spend  300  on_a_blender  i_was_impressed the_quality_and_the_look of_the_blender as_well as the_top locking lid which seems_to_do_a_good_job preventing any potential injuries  the_only concern i_have is_that_the_blade is_very long  sharp_and you_have_to_be_careful when_you clean it  i_would_not_recommend leaving this in_the_bottom_of_the sink drain  also  if_you_do need_to agitate whatever is in_the_blender  be_careful not to stick your fingers in_the_pitcher and_use_the_back_of a wooden spoon or_something similar   dangerous   powerful  this_is_a_great   powerful blender  but    warning  the_blades_are_insanely dangerous to_clean  if_you_don_t_have_a dishwasher  you_will slice open your fingers trying_to_clean it   great smoothie maker  this_blender works_great_for_smoothies from frozen_fruit_and_also homemade sherbet using frozen_fruit  the_only gripe i_have_about_it_is_that_it_is_a_bit challenging to_clean_the_blades and lid  first the_blades_are_very sharp so_you_have_to_be_very careful to not cut yourself and_the_lid has_a_lot_of nooks and crannies  granted if_you_have_a dishwasher this_wouldn_t be_as_much_of_an_issue  overall_the_blender fits my_needs very_well_and_i_did purchase the additional warranty from squaretrade so_i_am covered if anything happens in_the_next couple_of years  which with daily use could easily happen   because_it_could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if_you      i_ve_had_a_few blenders over_the years  there_was_a krups that_was_a wedding present and lasted about 15 years followed by a_much nicer breville that lasted maybe 2 years total  it_was the cheaper of_the_two similar models  but out_of_the_box  i_could tell that_the_motor was under powered  especially at it_s higher settings  it_smelled smoky  even new and_eventually it burned out  so  for it_s replacement i landed here  didn_t want_to_spend several hundred dollars  but went for wattage hp this_time_and_it_shows  confidence inspiring and_i_m_sure will handle whatever i throw at it  i make_smoothies almost every_day with_frozen_fruit_and_it handles with ease  the_blades_are crazy sharp_and stack up through_the_pitcher and seem_to pull the contents down  so everything gets crushed blended  the_pitcher locks to_the_base and_the_lid locks down_on_the_pitcher and_the_motor won_t run unless both are locked into_place  i_think this_is_a safety feature  because_it_could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if_you got_them_in_there  the_blade stack lifts out  which_makes cleaning easy  after_about_a_month of moderate heavy use  i m impressed and happy  this_is_a_very_good blender  
good_for this_price_point     i_purchased_the_ninja last week when_i remembered i_didn_t_have_a_blender at our vacation home  i_needed something_in_a hurry and didn_t_have time_to shop  i_am using_it_for_my green smoothies  spinach kale  water  and_some frozen_fruit   i_put_the spinach kale and water in_the_ninja then liquify before adding the frozen_fruit  ending up_with_a grainy drink with_a shake like thickness  i_can_temporarily live with_the graininess  though this may_be_a_problem for_some  the_blender container is large_enough_that_i_can make_a double serving with_no_problem  the_blade is scary  but_i handle it with_the utmost care and_so_far there have_been no mishaps  the_lid  container  and blade are extremely lightweight plastic and do_not seem sturdy  they_are dishwasher safe  making clean_up quick_and_easy  but_i_ve noticed the hollow handle retains internal moisture that does_not dry in_the course of_the_day  might lead to bacterial growth    overall this does_not_come_anywhere close_to_the high_end blender_i_have_at_home  i_don_t_expect this_blender to last very long  it_arrived within 48 hours through amazon prime  was safely packaged  and as_described  i_feel i_received what_i_would expect at_this_price_point  but have_already decided_to_purchase a_nicer blender before our next visit   it_s ok  wouldn_t get_again   my beloved  and expensive  breville recently broke  and after much researching  decided_to_get_this_as_a_replacement  the_pitcher definitely feels and sounds cheap thin like_it wants to_break  i swear every_time_i_use_it  the ice cubes are going_to crack it  i_use_it mostly for protein_powder shakes after the_gym  unfortunately the square shape means that powder gets in_the_corners and stays there  also  despite using every possible setting  i_can_t get_it to_blend the ice well  i_always feel the need_to_the shake a_bit as bigger ice chips always remain  i_always hand wash  which_is_easy   yay  this immediately after using_and after just_a_month  condensation is collecting in_the_handle  not cool  i_do like_the spout opening in_the_lid  which ensures that big blobs of shake or smoothie don_t make messes as_you pour  this_is_an ok blender  but feels like_it wants to_break and_i_m not impressed_with its functionality  prob wouldn_t buy_again   just ok  it_worked well_for_the_first few_months  but_then the_blades became very dull  we_have_a green smoothie every_morning with lots_of vegetables  the smoothies were becoming more_and more  chunky  and hard_to_get through even_a_huge smoothie straw  i_tried_to_get_a_replacement part but_there_are none_for this model  since we realized that we_are_very committed to daily green smoothies  we ended_up buying_a vitamix and wow   what_a_huge difference  i_never knew that_you_didn_t_have_to  chew  a green smoothie   the_ninja never blended our smoothies to a puree consistency  the_ninja is fine_for_some things  but_it_doesn_t compare to a vitamix   not good with chia flax seeds  after my_last blender died  everyone recommended a ninja  i_just made my_first shake and_it unfortunately doesn_t grind up blend chia or flax seeds  the spinach and_ice were blended fine  and_it_looks to_be sturdy_and built well  if_you_re not_going_to_be_adding any seeds or small items like_that_i imagine you_ll_be fine  but_i_believe the tower blades don_t catch them the_same way a traditionally structured blender does   it_blends  but_i_wouldn_t buy_it_again  i_saw several reviews of_this_blender accompanied by pictures of lacerations  i_thought to_myself   i_ve_been_using food processors and_other kitchen tools that have sharp  removable blades for_years with_no_problems      well  i_have managed to avoid any injuries  however_i_have more sympathy for_those people than_i_did before for_the following two reasons  1  the three tiers of blades mean that_there_is_no safe way_to dry this without blades sticking up_in_the air  unlike_a knife or_a food processor blade where_you_can lay it flat   standing it_upright the_way_it_sits in_the_carafe will make_it prone to tipping over  2  the_top part where_you must hold_the_blade is_small  tapered  and difficult_to grip firmly with wet hands  my_other complaint_is_that because_of_the three tiered blade assembly  it_is impossible_to safely push things down into_the_blender  i make_smoothies five days a_week_and_the kale that_i_used_to just press down_to_the_bottom so_that other ingredients would fit  i now have_to_blend for_a moment to_make room  not_a_huge chore  but_it_slows me down  i_don_t love_the locking lid and_i fear the_plastic moving parts will break before the_blender wears out  but_i_ve_been_using_this several days a_week for five months_and that_s_still working fine  bottom line  it_blends reliably  i_m_not_going_to_replace it  but_i_wouldn_t buy_it_again   not suitable for_all uses  this_blender_is_absolutely excellent if_you exclusively use_it to_blend whole pieces of fruit_and veggies  personally i make_a_lot_of smoothies_with items such_as yogurt and protein_powder added in  the trouble is it_has this_very long three bladed pillar that extends almost all_the_way_to_the_lid from_the_bottom  if_you_are trying_to_add in_a powder or_something like yogurt  it catches on_all_the_blades  which means that unless_you planned to fill the_blender all_the_way_to_the_top  that_stuff won_t make_it_into_your smoothie and_will instead stick and you_have_to scrape it_in_and blend again  also_it_s ridiculously powerful even on_the_low setting  which again_isn_t good if_you only want_to_make less_than maximum capacity  since_it_splatters everywhere and you either lose a_lot  or have_to sit there and scrape it_all out with_a spatula  overall_it_s just_a_lot_of trouble unless_you_are using_it to full capacity every_time  
i m disappointed because because we cant seem_to ave the_option      my mom had got one_of_these blenders and_it_had gotten four symmetrical cracks in_all four bottom_of_the_plastic container causing_it to leak  thinking we stored it wrong causing_the cracks we_bought_another  not more_than_the_two weeks we_had the_new_one simply crushing ice had put_the_same identical four cracks in_the_new blender  i m disappointed because because we cant seem_to ave the_option to_return either blenders  which are now useless  its_a shame because_the_blenders worked_great other_than_the cracking feature  file    c  users jacob downloads img 0742 jpg  nice blender_but       i_ve_been_using_this_blender_for 5 months_and worked_great  super powerful blender with nice design  but  the_plastic jar since to_be made_of a poor_quality plastic because_it cracked while blending  i_use_the_blender around 4 to 5 times a_week  i_only blend fruits_and_i_don_t_even use_ice  i_ve_been trying_to contact the_seller but_not_answer  phone just keep ringing  i_m_very_disappointed for_what_it_could_have_been_a_great machine   poor_quality   updating my_review 1 5 years after purchase  i_loved my blender  but_it literally broke into pieces after only_a_year_and change  a_few_months after_i_got_it  a crack started_to form and_eventually just broke wide open  keep_in_mind  i_only_used_this to_make_smoothies  it_wasn_t heavily used or_anything  i_m_so disappointed  my thrift store blender lasted longer than this  i expect much_more_for this_price   pitcher cracks too easily  the_blender_is fine  but_the_pitcher keeps cracking  almost immediately  i_had_a_replacement pitcher sent after_a_month of_use  and_the_first_time_i_use_the replacement there_was_a crack forming  it_took_a_few weeks or_so for_the_corner to completely break off  and more cracks are forming around_the_base still  i reached out_to ninja and_i_would_have_to_pay  64 for_a 2nd replacement  which seems crazy since this_is clearly a defect  i m only using_this to_make_smoothies_with_frozen blueberries and bananas mostly  so_there_should_be no reason that_this keeps happening   disappointing  not worth_the_cost   was_really looking_forward to_getting this_blender as_i heard so_many people rave about_their ninja_blenders and_i_wanted_a_nice one to_make fruit_smoothies_with on_a regular basis  i_was_pretty disappointed_with_this_one  pros    blades easily remove to_make pouring and_cleaning easy   nice pour spout_on lid  don_t_have_to_remove lid to pour    chops ice well cons    because_the_blades_are_in_the_middle  i_find that_some food items i_put_in just get pushed out_to_the_sides and stick there instead_of getting blended in no_matter_how_long i let it blend  i_have_to_open up_and scrape the food off_the_sides to ensure that_it_all gets mixed together_and_there_are no chunks  even_when_i add more liquid in_the mixture  this continues to_be_an_issue    does_not chop up things like pomegranate seeds  included in_one_of_the frozen berry mixes i buy from costco  no_matter_how_long i blend it  i end up chewing on whole seeds every_time so_i_have started buying_a_different berry mixture so_i_don_t_have_to_worry_about seeds but_i_shouldn_t have_to_do_that  i_wish_i_could return this_and_use_the_money towards a_higher quality blender   because_i_hate this_blender so_much  this_is the_first_time my three young children are all napping in_the afternoon  of_all_the  many many  things_i_could_be doing right_now  i_chose to write this_review  because_i_hate this_blender so_much  let s count the_ways  shall we  1  the_blade and blade holder is huge and_does_not_allow larger chunks of fruit or vegetables to_be placed inside_the container  2  the_blades_are all placed on_the_side  and none_in_the center bottom_of_the_blade holder  meaning there_is_no centrifugal force  meaning that_the_blades scatter the components of_your smoothie all_over_the container  instead_of towards the center bottom_of_the container  this means that_you_cannot open_the_lid to_add more liquid or fruit as_it_is blending  3  the_blades_are_not locked into_place and fall_out when_you pour 4  it_is unnecessarily loud  heavy  and clunky  5  it_does_not blend properly  it_is_about_as effective as_a mortar and pestle  so_in_the spirit of fairness  i_gave this_thing two stars as_it_does sort_of blend things and_if_you_want_to_use_it to_make fruit_smoothies  i suppose it_does the_job  however  if_you_want_to_make_any creamy soups  vegetable smoothies  or sauces you_are better off with_a regular  30 oster  my cheap blender does a_more thorough job_and_gets less dirty  i_finally thought i_was rid of_this nightmare when_it  after only_a_year  with maybe bi weekly use  it crapped out_on_me  the_manufacturer offered to_send me_a_new motor  but_i_was to_pay the  30 shipping  thanks but_no thanks  verdict  not_even_as_good_as_a_cheap blender  does kind_of blend   customer_service is laughable  pros  easy_to_use  cleans easy in dishwasher  blends thoroughly  safe locking starting mechanism cons  ninja customer_service is_a joke if something fails  weak pitcher latch on ours broke 45 days after purchase   was told a_replacement pitcher was  65  warranty was only valid if purchased directly from_them_and only covered the_motor base  lid and pitcher are_not  no 60 day guarantee or years warranty   doesn_t put_the  smooth  in  smoothie   if_you_re interested in making green smoothies like i_am  you might want_to_look elsewhere  even on_the highest setting  my smoothie  kale  banana  apple  and 2  milk  is chunky and chewy  see picture   seeing a_video review comparing this_blender to_the kitchenaid 5 speed diamond blender has convinced me that_if_i_want_to_put_the  smooth  in  smoothie   i_need_to_get_the latter  which_is ostensibly quieter and blends veggies very_well  will_be returning this_one tomorrow   cracked and leaking after less_than_a_month s use  i_was_very_happy_with_this_blender when_i_first tried it  i_have_always had 20 dollar blenders so_this_was_a step up because_it_is_much_more powerful  i make_smoothies_and blend cauliflower for mash sometimes  but_the primary reason for purchase was to_make bulletproof coffee every_morning  upon first use for bp coffee it produced froth like i_have_never_had_and_it_was truly delicious  the_reason i landed on_this_blender_is_because_after doing research for_the_best blender specifically for bp coffee this_was recommended if_you_are_not willing to splurge for_a vitamix or blendtec  at_this point  i may have_to_do_that  because even this_blender has_already cracked and_is leaking after less_than_a_month s use  luckily i_am still in_the return frame for_amazon so_they_are sending me_a_new_one  i_also purchased warranty   upon doing more research  people say_in_order to_keep blenders from cracking when making bp coffee  you must release the air pressure out_of_the_blender by taking off_the_top after no_more_than blending for 10 seconds  then_you_can put_the_top back_on_and blend for_additional time_if needed  i_am_going_to_try this method  and hopefully it_will keep_it_from cracking  
blender jar exploded   i_ve_had my_ninja for_about 18 months  i_loved it  used primarily for_smoothies_with_frozen_fruit  the_other day_it exploded on_me_and tore a hole through it  i_have contacted ninja  they didn_t seem_too concerned about_it  and when_i pressed them_and offered to_send them the defective blender jar so_they could figure_out_the defect  they didn_t seem very interested  the email they gave me was_incorrect so_i_have_to call_them again to_try and pursue this  i_don_t want another_one  i_just want them check it_out because obviously there_is_an_issue   poor plastic  broke within 8 months with little usage  do_not_recommend  costly warranty   bought on october 6  2016  one_of_the clip that locks the_lid on broke off after minimal usage  the broken clip prevents the_blender lid from locking and deactivating the safety  rendering the_blender useless  their warranty states that_i_will_have_to_pay  19 95 to cover_the_cost_of returning a_replacement  factor in_the_cost to_ship the broken blender to_them  that_would_be 40 45  of_the_original purchase price  i_would_not_recommend_this_blender  stick with glass container versus plastic   broke after three uses  after three uses a crack developed along the_bottom_of_the_pitcher from one end to_the_other  the_only_thing_i ever blended was fruit  their warranty states that_i_will_have_to_pay  19 95 for shipping to_have it replaced  at 20  of_the_purchase price  i_don_t_even know_if_it_s worth_it  based_on_my experience  i_do_not_recommend_this_blender   piece_of  s ierra  h otel  i ndia  t ango  nice concept however  the_entire operations and_use comes down_to a improperly designed and fragile tab that_is_easy_to_break off_and renders the_blender useless  after the_fact  i_have read this_is_a common problem_with_the_blender  see red light blinks   now_i_have_a 1000watt paper weight  i_purchased_the extended warranty from square trade via amazon_and_the just referred me_to_the manufacture  not what_i_expected  will_not purchase from manufacture again  amazon  you let_me down   the_blender that cracks and breaks when_you wash it_in_a dishwasher  yikes  i_bought_this_blender as_i_thought this_would_be_a_solid blender to_make_my_smoothies  boy was_i wrong  i_am_an avid juicer  and normally also love smoothies  when_i_bought_this_blender_i_was_not trying_to chop up_onions or_anything hard and crazy just making a shake and_something easy_to_clean  however after 2 3 washes in_the dishwasher i_saw a crack and on_top_of_the crack i_also saw this_blender leak all_over_my counter  its disgusting and time consuming to_clean_the actual blender_for_all_the droplets of_my smoothie and_it just makes_a_huge mess  if_you_want a_solid blender this_is_not the one guys look for_a glass blender   zero stars   leaked after only 6 weeks of_use  if_i_could leave zero stars i_would  we purchased_this to_make bullet proof coffee  and that_is_all it_was used_for in_the six weeks we_had_it_in_our possession  we used_it twice daily for 6 weeks to_blend coffee with butter and mct oil  we blended for_a maximum of 60 seconds each time we used_it  we never used ice in_the_machine while we owned it  after only six weeks  it began leaking at_the_base where_the_blade attaches  there_was_no_way for us to tighten anything  for_the amount_of_money we paid_for it  this_was_a_huge disappointment   professional     yeah right    this_is_not_a professional blender  pros  it blended our contents quickly_and efficiently  albeit  it_was only coffee and butter  other cons  the_carafe is plastic  not glass  i_knew this when_i_ordered it  but_i_just cannot understand what s so hard about making a_blender that_is_made with glass and metal  i owned an oster for 20 years_and_it_was_awesome until the_blade started_to leak  and when_we replaced it  the  oem part  cracked within 2 months  they_just don_t make_appliances like_they use to 20 years ago  also  this_blender_is huuuuuuge  it_wouldn_t_even fit under my cabinets  so_i_had_to leave the_carafe off_and sit it to_the_side  taking up twice as_much_of_my counter top space  also  it_s very loud  but most blenders are  we never_had_any_issues_with_the_blade  flying out at us  like one review we read  you_just_have_to_be_careful when pouring  which_is where_the spot comes_in handy  or remove_the_blade to pour your contents  would i purchase it_again or recommend_this_product  absolutely not  i_had the_option to exchange it  but_if an appliance can show that kind_of poor design after only 6 weeks  i_don_t want anything to_do with it  we went back_to_an oster    with_a glass carafe  and_so_far it_s working_great     lasted one month  cracked and broken  leaks   this lasted about_a_month before the_pitcher cracked on_the_bottom and started leaking  also  one_of_the_black plastic feet on_the_pitcher broke off  this_blender_is ridiculously awful  worst blender  absolutely the_worst blender_i_have_ever purchased  i_used_it_all_of three times_and_the light wouldn_t stop flashing even_though_i_had_it aligned properly  i called customer_service and_they_were_absolutely useless  turns out that_even_though_the_blender says dish washer safe you_can only put_it_on_the_top shelf which doesn_t make sense because_it_s too_big to_fit on_any standard dishwashers top shelf  apparently a piece on_the jug melted off in_the dishwasher  needless to_say_i_am never buying one_of_their products again   poor_quality construction   the_blender jar cracked and leaks after just 1 and half months of light use  it_was_not dropped or slammed  just cracked by_the spinning part at_the_bottom  very dissapointed   read before you buy  warranty info   i_wanted_to really_like_this_product based_on_all_the positive reviews_i_read  i_bought_it_in_august  and_now_it_s_november and_the_pitcher has cracked  i_used_it may_be once a_week to_blend smoothies  the_pitcher is_not covered by_their 1 year warranty  which_is ridiculous  like_it_s an_extra part or_something  to_return the_product you_have_to_pay  19 99  is it worth_it  you_decide for_yourself   hate it  so let_me start by saying that      hate it  so let_me start by saying that_i_had_a_real ninja before this_one  i dropped it and broke it_so here i go and purchase this_one_for_a_great_deal  unfortunately when this_blender arrived and from_the very first_time_i_used_it  once_i turn it on to_blend the contents splash out through_the_top  i_guess the_lid doesnt fit properly or maybe its the_rubber on_the_lid that_isnt good  either way_in_order for it not to splash out  i_need_to tightly hold down_the_lid while_it_blends  and when_its time_to pour  im supposed_to easily lift the_corner and pour  however when_i pour it_comes pouring out around_the_whole lid making a_huge mess  i_have_to_remove_the_entire lid and blade in_order to free pour  big waste of_my money and time   but_this_is such_a horrible blender_for_what_you_pay  i_never write reviews  but_this_is such_a horrible blender_for_what_you_pay  i_had_to write a_review  another reviewer wrote it_takes the smooth out_of smoothie and he couldnt be_more right  im not_sure how this_blender got so_many good reviews  so_many times i_tried making my_smoothies_and aa bowls and_had_to stick a spoon in_the_blender and push all_the chunks to_the center because_they_wouldnt blend  i end up dumping my smoothie into_my nitribullet to_get_all_the chunks out_of it  the_designers went wrong when_they decided_to_put three sets of blades going up   all it_does is send everything flying to_the_sides  making me have_to constantly scrape the_sides of_the_blender  the_lowest setting is_still too high  ugh  i_need_a vitamix   stopped_working after 6 months  not_even 6 months old  only_used maybe 10 times  stoped working  power_button blinks but_nothing works  i_have_all_the arrows lined up  everything on right  nothing  went online and so_many people bought_this_blender have same problem  waste of_money  no stars_for_me  worst blender ever  as someone else mentioned in_their review  this_blender takes the  smooth  out_of  smoothie   no_matter_how_long i blend  there_are_still massive chunks in_my  smoothie   and_it_s nearly undrinkable  look_at_the variety of_user uploaded photos and you_ll see what_i_mean  also  this_blender was shipped in it_s original box  with_no discreet packaging whatsoever  so the_whole neighborhood  including potential thieves  knew exactly_what_it_was_as_it_sat on_my front porch  it_also means that_the_box i_have_to_return_it_in  the_original packaging  is_already beat up from shipping the_first_time  i honestly have_no idea how this_blender has_been so popular  it_is the_worst blender_i_have_ever used  including other cheaper blenders  
the quintessential blender  just bought_this inexpensive blender_for_my bro because his old_one broke  pros    sturdy_and made from strong metal and plastic   32oz is_a_great_amount_of space for blending opportunities   the_two 16oz jars are convenient sizes for smaller blends   simple on_and off buttons anyone could use   fast_and durable blade that cuts through even the_most unyielding fruit   sleek design and fashionable color scheme   easy_to_clean   extremely affordable cons    travel lids could_have_been built to_be_more secure   pouring from_the 32oz into_another cup is_not_as smooth as_it_could_be overall  fantastic blender especially at such_a_low_price_point  it_outperforms blenders that_are two or three times as expensive and carries out_the basic functions smoothly   great_for families   this_is my_favorite blender yet  we make_a_lot_of smoothies   milkshakes but_the_kids like different flavors than_the adults do  i make the_kids shakes in_the 32 oz  my_husband s protein shake in_the 16oz and my fruit_smoothie in_the_other 16oz  thanks to_the versatility of_this_awesome blender set now_i_can_easily make everybody s shakes and smoothies in minutes  we use_this_all_the_time_and absolutely_love_it   excellent smoothie mixer for_the_price     awesome for_what_it_is    a cost effective smoothie mixer  please don_t buy_this thinking you_re getting_a top_of_the_line food processor or juicer for_a bargain  it_s_not designed for that  i_love using_it_for protein or fruit yogurt smoothies  chops up ice relatively well if_you_do the cubes a_few at_a time when there_s liquid  i_ve_been_using_this_thing every_day for_the_past couple_of months_and no_issues so_far  cleans up super_easy as_well   super blender  great  smaller blender_for folks who don_t need bells and whistles  smooth operation  great function  and_i_ve made great use of_the mini cups for smaller jobs  doesn_t take_a_lot_of room on_the counter  and_has_a_nice sleek  modern look  definitely worth_the_money   found the_perfect smoothie maker  just_what_i_wanted  i_have_a_smaller blender that does about two cups at_a time  and_i_have_had bigger blenders that_are just too_big_and heavy with_the thick glass pitchers  this_is_perfect  we make_smoothies_and milkshakes for_the_kids  one at_a time  if tastes vary  or mix a_few in_the bigger pitcher  we really love_the_option of blending in_the  take with you  cups   a_good purchase   i_actually love_this_blender  proud owner of a vitamix here  i_needed something a_little smaller as the vitamix takes up a_lot_of counter space  this_little guy is_awesome  i_would_not suggest use_all frozen_fruits to_make_a_smoothie with_this  its_not powerful enough  i defrosted my fruits for_my smoothie and_i_used_a_couple frozen_fruit pieces to substitute for ice  with_a scoop of natures bounty vitamin_and protein mix  it_was smooth_and delicious  also_this_little guy doesnt make that much noise   works_great  very convenient   this_is_an awesome little blender  i make_smoothies in it just_about every_day  make_sure that_you_re adding enough liquid  and_use pulse to chop up frozen_fruit ice  sometimes when_i blend in_the_cup i_have_to_take it off_the_blender and give_it a_little shake to_move stuff around  but_it_s_not_a_big_deal to_do so   awesome blender  since everything come_apart  awesome blender  since everything come_apart  it_s really_easy_to_clean  and_it_s useful for_not_only blended drinks  but_also making pesto_and_the like  we use_it near daily  so_it_gets washed a_lot  the_only_thing_i_would caution someone on is_that_i_wouldn_t put_it_in_the dishwasher  even_though_it_says top rack safe  after unfortunate incidents with_another blender and_some plastic cups    i_wouldn_t recommend doing that   and_i_m so_happy i_did  my_son_and_i_have_been on_a  smoothie kick  lately  so_i_purchased_this  stay or go  blender  and_i_m so_happy i_did  we ve_been_using_it every_day  sometimes twice a_day  for_about_a_week  it_works_great with_frozen_fruit  as_long_as_you add enough liquid   and_clean_up is_a_breeze  love_the_options of_the_pitcher and or  to_go  cups  as_well     we use both  it_s much_more quiet than_my former blender     which_is_great  i_highly_recommend_this_product to_anyone_who makes smoothies   great  cheap  blender  great_little blender  love_that_it_has the different containers  i_can assemble 3 smoothies at_a time  which works_great_for_the toddlers   it_is_not_very powerful  if_you_want_to mix up greens you_will_have_to let it

worth your_money  reliable brand  powerful motor   best for milk shakes  i_was_looking_for_some lightweight blender which can chop onions  make salsa and milk shakes  this_blender_is one_of_the cheapest ones yet have_all sort_of fancy attachments  looks good and have_a powerful  650  watt motor  negative   only_one single speed option_and pulse  there could_be_at_least one more option for speed may_be_at half speed   travel cup_to_go flask s lid is_not convenient to drink  it_is practically of no use_and_i rather drink it_straight out_of_the 16oz cup    no_more usage and washing of other cups glasses      really small capacity  but_in_this_price with so_many attachments  it_has to_be small   plastic container looks_like cheaply made_and seems_like_it may break easily  however mine is working fine so_far   i_don_t_like_the orientation design of blades  only two levels  one_of_the_bottom blade could_be fixed at centre  i_ve seen so_in some_other blenders  there_is considerable gap and can leave small pieces untouched  i_wish_in listing they_would_have uploaded the_picture of blades  never mind i_am_attaching in_my_review for_all other buyers     lid for 32oz jar is_not tight enough  it just fits it but_not_like_air tight or spill free  positive   powerful motor 650 watt motor  peak speed   one single option for speed which_is top speed   probably most powerful in_this_price segment   several fancy attachments   although orientation of blades is_not good_but motor is powerful enough_to_move the_most_of_the content   lightweight  yet powerful   absolutely perfect_for shakes   for_anything else it_does the_job but_not good_enough   priced right   cheap for number_of attachments provided   little_bit_of quality compromised in plastic but still good_enough  bpa free plastic jars conclusion  if_your primary purpose is making milk shakes  don_t think twice  its the_best deal  although_the travel cup s cap is_not designed_to travel  the mouth have_no lid and_is kind_of inconvenient to drink  cheap price  reliable brand  light_weight            update on 17th december  after heavy use of 1 5 year  this_blender gave up  used_for milk shakes almost everyday  ps  if this_review was helpful to you in_anyway_then please vote  yes helpful   a_great machine for_all kinds of drinks  lots_of power  small size  well_integrated cups   we love_this_machine  we wanted_to_get_a_second cup for_a previous h b blender  but_they_were  8   this turned out_to_be so cheap i_bought_it_instead   we paid about  22  it_seems_to_have gone up since_then  but look around for_another listing on_amazon   one_of us is on_a liquid diet  so_it_gets used several times a_day  we_are now drinking lots_of fruit_smoothies  likes  well_integrated blending drinking cups  three sizes as shown in_the_pictures  plus a regular 32 oz  blender cup  overall small footprint on_the counter  we keep_it_on_the counter and never have_to_get out our full sized blender since 32 oz is plenty  many clever design touches  including the_way_the_blade goes on_the open end for mixing  then comes off for drinking  it_comes_with 2 large  sippy cup  lids  plus one lid that_can_be opened or closed for travel  very_easy_to_remove from_the_blender briefly to_add more ingredients or give_it a shake  the containers seem_to_be_a_very_sturdy plastic  no bpa  as_long_as_you clean_them immediately after use  a jet of warm water is enough although we use_a bottle brush  lots_of power  unlike_its predecessor   400 watts i_think  i_would_not run it_for 2 minutes straight  but 45 seconds is_no_problem  plenty_of power to chop frozen_fruit or_anything else   see below about full sized ice cubes   good design of_the switch  you_can_easily blip it_for_a_few seconds  or turn it on_and let it run  the parts assemble and disassemble very quickly  with_no_way_to_put_them_together wrong  except see below about_the  coupling    flaws  the biggest problem is the high aspect ratio of_the_two big drinking cups   meaning  tall and thin   this makes_them harder to_clean   the_bottom_of_the_cup won_t get clean in_a dishwasher  i understand why they did it   the_small diameter is needed_to_keep the  footprint  of_the_blender small  we_bought_a  4 bottle brush which_is_perfect_for cleaning them_and solves the problem  the_small cup does_not_have this problem   they should provide two small_and one large  instead_of vice versa  the high aspect ratio also sometimes leads to poor circulation between_the_top_and bottom when blending  be sure_to leave a one_inch bubble inside  so_you_can remove it and give_it a_quick shake  when_we first got_it  we sometimes failed to_push_the_cup down far enough on_the_base  the result was rapid erosion of_the coupler between_the_blades and_the_base   details of_the_design are tedious   it_makes sense once_you_see it   so_far this_has_not caused_any problem  minor safety flaw  the switch is_very_easy_to trigger accidentally  there_is_no  completely off  setting other_than unplugging  for_the_most part the_design_is_very safe as the_blades_are completely inaccessible while_it_s mixing  however you_can put_the_blades onto_the_base without_any cup   there_s_no reason you_would want_to  but_i_did it once when_we first got_it   in that_situation  it_is dangerous since a momentary touch of_the hair trigger switch will start the_blades and shred anything they touch  like fingers  in short  i_would_have preferred a safety interlock that prevents the_motor from running unless everything_is in_the_right place  tips  use crushed ice  if_you must use full sized cubes  take care that_they_don_t jam the_blades  order of ingredients matters  frozen ingredients go in_the_top  so when_you blend they_are_on_the_bottom  keep the overall mixture liquid enough  for_example  add milk in_addition_to yoghurt  i suspect with 90  greek yoghurt  it_would never mix the_top_and_the_bottom  overall  we love_it and_use_it constantly  as mentioned  i d like to_give_it 5_stars  but_the tall aspect ratio requires several adjustments to deal with   most_of_the_reviews are_on point  still a_great_blender   been_using_it a_while now  the_blender_is_pretty powerful  but  if_you hold it_down for_more_than 2 3 seconds  there_is_a burning smell  if_i fill it_up_to_the_top  i_have_to shake the ingredients between pulses  but with enough liquid  i_use milk   i_find i_don_t_have_too_much_of a_problem  if_you_use yogurt  i_found any more yogurt than 50 50 really taxed the_motor   great_product  i_love_this_blender  i_use_the_blade for both the_larger cup but_also_the individual bottles  i_didn_t realize it_was only_one speed  but_i_only use_it_for_smoothies so_i_don_t mind  it cleans easily  i_ve left stuff in it_for days before and_it_still cleans quickly_and easily  i_love_it  and_i_thought it_was_a_decent price   great_blender  just one small critique   this_blender set is_great_for_the_price  the_motor is strong enough_to shred through ice without skipping a beat  and_the contents mixes throughout down_to_the_blades_no_problem  the bottle containers easily transition from_the_blender attachment  screwed onto_the_top  to_the bottle easily  by just screwing on_the bottle attachment  the cheese grader works_as_expected  and can_turn whole parmesan into shredded parmesan in_a matter of seconds  i_also use_the_blender to_make frozen drinks  or for protein shakes if_i_am mixing more_than one  my_old blender  a ninja  would_have this_issue where_the protein_powder would_get stuck to_the_sides and not_actually mix into_the drink  for_whatever reason  perhaps the shape of_the bottle or the_size_of_the interior relative to_the_motor  this doesn_t happen with_my hamilton beach stay or go blender  pros  strong motor  easy_to_use_and convenient attachments  easy_to_clean  multiple bottle containers make for convenient access  cons  only_one speed  i personally don_t mind though   with_a  pulse  and_an  on  setting  the_tops for_the drink containers do_not_have_a valve to let air circulate into_the bottle while you_drink  creating a suction problem  i fixed this problem by drilling a_tiny hole into_the_top with_my smallest drill bit  and_it now works 100  to satisfaction  though_it_would_be nice if this_was done by_the_manufacturer   good_but loud  the multiple sizes make this_a_great_product  my_only problem is it_s loud like really loud  go far it_has worked like_a charm for blended coffee  fruit_smoothie  cream soup  and homemade pasta sauce  very_pleased  great_for_smoothies  best used_for making smoothies  not_really_good to_be used_as_a standard  blender  because_it just is_not strong enough  but as_a_smoothie maker i rate it 100   that_was_my purpose for buying_this_product to_make_smoothies  so all is_good  i_do recommend_this_product for_smoothies_and a_great_price  thank_you  good blender  i waited a_few_months to review this_blender  i_really wanted_to_see how_it_did first  i_have_to_say_i m impressed  i make_a_lot_of smoothies using ice and frozen_fruits_and_it_blends them well  the_only_thing_is it_will leave a_little pulp or crushed seeds  for_the_price though compared_to some very high_end blenders its definitely worth_it  i_also love_that_it_came_with two large travel cups and one smaller with shaker lid  definitely_recommend  worth a_lot more_than_the_price  ok for_the_price you might think_it_s a dud or_a_cheapie but_no  buy_it  i_have_been making smoothies_and_it_blends through oats and_ice and whole almost easily  today_i_made carrot ginger apple juice  all are_very fibrous and_it made easy change out_of it  you_will_not_be disappointed   price_is_great  wish_it_would_have came_with closed lids      price_is_great  wish_it_would_have came_with closed lids for taking the_cups on_the go  only comes_with lids with open holes in_them   works very_well so_long as_you_don_t_have_too      works very_well so_long as_you_don_t_have_too_much in_the well_for_the_motor_and blades to handle   then_it_can_get_a_bit hot and_you_can definitely tell by_the smell  the parts are a_bit hard_to_clean  but being dishwasher safe definitely helps   good_buy for_the_price_but won_t blend ice on_the_first try  great with_all_the attachments but you_ll rarely use_the_small shaker thing cause_it_s just too_small  i_use_it to_blend up fruit_smoothies_with ice and_i constantly have_to_take it off_the_stand_and shake it_up by hand_then put_it_back_on  great_buy for_the_price_but you_ll have_to_do some_of_the work yourself   this_is_a_good vendor for its price  this_is_a_good vendor for its price  works_well  unless_you_want_to_blend the ingredients very_very finely  this_will do the_job  plus you_can blend your shake directly into_the mugs   glasses that come_with_the_blender and_it_makes everything so_much convenient   powerful_and_easy_to_clean  powerful_and_easy_to_clean  4_stars_because_the tumblers aren_t very_easy_to drink out_of  and leak when closed   i_use_it_for blending frozen_fruit  okay product i_bought to_make me shakes from frozen_fruit_and_it_works pretty_good_for_the_price   great_blender  this_blender has_been great so_far  i_use_it to_make protein shakes before_i go_to_work_in_the morning and_it_is quick_and blends everything perfectly  the_only down side is the travel bottles don_t close  there_is_just_an opening for drinking or for_a straw  but as_long_as_you_are_not planning on sealing it_up_and drinking it later it_works just_fine   flimsy but functional   cheap plastic  the mixing jar is_a_bit flimsy  but_it_does what_it_is supposed_to_do  large blades_are_easy_to_clean   it_was_great while_it lasted  it_was_great while_it lasted  we used_this to_make_smoothies for breakfast almost every_morning for 6 months until the_motor died  
i_ve_used_it many times_and_still like_it  it_s compact which_is_nice  since_i_have very little counter space  but_it_can_get_a_little noisy  so_no late night smoothies  what made me choose this_one_was the individual sippy cups that blend right on_the_base  now_i_can make_a_single size smoothie  also clean_up is_pretty easy  but_i_had_to_buy_a_long bristled cleaner to_get_the crevices because_i_couldn_t get my hands in_there   cheap bushings    very powerful motor   just smaller_than we thought  after 8 months it_s leaking on bottom where_the chopper is_at   the ceramic washer fell apart an it_s really loose   contacted seller an they said_i_had_to_go thru manufacture  i_have_a backup 1 that_s a hamilton beach that_s 10 yrs old an doesn_t leak   the_only_reason we ordered new 1 is_because_it_had_a_small tear on lid   don_t buy_this 1    not_very powerful  not_a_full sized blender  not_very powerful either but_it_does the trick for_smoothies  i_feel_like_the_motor is going_to_go out pretty quick though  wish_i_would_have spent a_little_more_and_got something_else but_im making it work as_long_as_i_can   lids don_t close   the_blender_is_better_than_average for_the_price  ive_had_it_for_a_year_and_it_s_still running strong   but_the stupid cups it_comes_with don_t_have lids that close  they_are permanently open  even the one with_a twisty top  pictured ont he smallest cup_in_the_image  is completely insecure  so don_t_even think about  go  ing anywhere with those     good_for_smoothies_without_ice if_you think ahead  it_s ok_i_can_do_a_few things_i_got_it_for but_it_seems_to leek really easily_and jams even on partially thawed frozen bananas  the travel cups_are an absolute amazing bonus with_this_item however_the_blades suck and      i_bought_this_because_i_needed_a_blender  the travel cups_are an absolute amazing bonus with_this_item however_the_blades suck and_it_really doesn_t blend ice or things like_the_way_i_expected it too  
it exploded  i_ve_had_this_blender_for_under a_month and_use_it to_make_smoothies  this morning  i_was making my smoothie like usual  the_blender started making weird noises  smoke started coming out from under it  and_then weird pieces of burnt plastic started flying out from it   this_was_a_great_little blender_for_about_3_months when_we used      this_was_a_great_little blender_for_about_3_months when_we used_it_for primarily fresh  softly frozen or_almost thawed fruits_and yogurt  frozen_fruit with yogurt and milk killed it  absolutely burned up the_motor_and filled our house with_a stinky burning smell   i_am disappointed in_this_product_and_will_not_buy_another   very_small   the  large  part_of_the_blender_is_very_small  contents do_not fill a mason jar  i_wanted it because_the thought of being able_to_take_the portable cups was_appealing  i_would return_it  but_the_box got thrown away  there_is_also only_one button option   not_very_happy_with_this  not_very_happy_with_this  i_thought the to_go cups would_be nice but_it_doesn_t make up for_the loss of power  it left ice cube chunks as_well as chunks of frozen strawberries in_my_smoothies  kind_of defeats the purpose of a_smoothie  so_it_is_super_easy_to spill them  it_doesn_t blend very_well_and_the_lids of_the_cups don_t_have_a way_to_close  the_holes are open   so_it_is_super_easy_to spill them it_would_be nice if_there_was_an adjustment to_blend the_cups themselves instead_of using_the big blender to pour into_the_cups   refund was quick_and fast   was_a_good blender while_it_worked  but just quite turning on_one_day  i_used every_day but only for 2 weeks then_it quite  returned for full refund  bought_a_different kind  so_far no_problems   i_m_sure_it_s a fine blender  but who wants to deal with_all      i_m_sure_it_s a fine blender  but who wants to deal with_all_these pieces  it_doesn_t fit a mason jar as someone_indicated in_the questions  and_it_comes_with_a_ton_of varying sized plastic containers  the_main blender part is weirdly small   maybe enough_for two big smoothies  i m returning_it   the_cups_are a_nice add on  you_get what_you_pay_for  the_blender doesnt mix well unless_you add alot_of water  the_cups_are a_nice add on  but_the_lids leak  i_ve_been_using_this for_a_month for shakes in_the morning and_it_takes forever to_blend properly  next time_id just invest in_a_decent blender   good luck with_this_blender  good luck with_this_blender  if_you_put ice in it it basically clogs up  it_doesnt blend worth a crap  you_get what_you_pay_for on_this_product   two stars  it_s a_decent little machine for_the_price  tends to over heat_and smoke if_your not careful  
really disappointed     got_this to_make_smoothies_and after_adding the fruit_and liquid i turned on_the_blender and_it made noise but didn_t really blend anything  i added more liquid and moved everything around with_a spoon_and turned it_back_on but_it_still only cut through what_was on_the_bottom  i_think_it_was peaches  but_nothing else really happened  i_finally added even more liquid and_still it_didn_t blend the fruit  i_wish when_i_bought_this_that_i_had tried it_sooner so_i_could_have sent it_back but_i_was_in_the_middle of moving and just_got to_try it recently  it_has_been sitting in_my cabinet unused since_then and_we already got_a_different blender to_use_instead  i_know hamilton beach makes_great_products but_this_one just isn_t one_of_them   do_not use dangerous if making more_than one  the_cups_are awesome but pointless since motor burned out a_month after having it and_we only_used_it_for making smoothies which we love but only_had maybe three times_and_there_s 4 of us so the_two to_go cup_and_the_pitcher   2 servings  perfect_for_my family except that_it burned out when making the_last smoothie  i_had_to grab it by_the_cord and chucked it_outside in_the snowbank cause_it_was smoking so bad i_was worried it_would actually burst into flames  luckily no one got hurt except my pride since now_i m the mother who can burn smoothies  probably fine if only making one but what_if_it_would_have done this to one_of_the_kids they might not_have_acted quick enough could_have started house on fire  poorly made  i_just_got my blender this week went to_open_and_use_it_for_the_first_time  and_there_was black stuff coming out_of_the_bottom  the_bottom is poorly made_it_came_apart the_first_time_i_used_it and_got my counter top super dirty  i included a picture   terrible blender  i_ve_used_this_about_5 times  i_was making herbalife  which_is_just powder  smoothies_with it  it first started_to smoke after the_2nd use  i  d turn_off_the_blender  rearrange the device  stir it   try again  i_thought if_it_could crush ice  like_advertised   it_could blend frozen_fruit  along_with regular fruit with_no_problem  it_s overheated so badly  that_it just stopped_working  i_ve_had_it no_longer than_a_few month  very_disappointed in_this_product   going_to_be looking_for_a_new model   brand for_my next purchase  wouldn_t advise wasting your_money on it   cheaply made_and broke after 7 weeks of_use  do_not_recommend     a friend and_i_ordered these right after christmas to mix up our protein shakes and one already broke  was smoking last night  i_noticed when_i_use mine  it_also smells hot  we_are_only mixing a cup of crushed ice and plenty_of liquids so_not putting a_lot_of stress on_the_machine  the_window has closed for return so very_disappointed  i_do_not_recommend_this_product  i_guess you_get what_you_pay_for   as cheap as_you_d expect     the_blender struggles to_blend the simplest items  even_a yogurt based drink takes multiple minutes and leaves your kitchen smelling like burnt rubber  every_time_i_want_to_use_the_blender  i_have_to shake the_whole thing as_i blend and must continually tighten the_base  because_the vibrations will loosen the_fit and cause_a major mess   the_motor is_also very loud  i_m_a college student and require thrifty purchases  but_this_is_a waste of_money  do yourself a favor_and spend the_extra  30   one_star  this_thing came broken and started sounding weird  smoke was coming out update  order a_different one and_got cancel by amazon  because_there_was_none left  i order a_new_one_of_this thinking maybe the_first_one_was defective   wronggg    this_thing_is loud  makes_noises that_im afraid its going_to_break  i_did a banana a frozen strawberries smoothie and_i felt like i_put rocks inside that were destroying it  smell like_its burning  start shaking strangely  im not giving this_another chance  im returning_it asap and don_t_even look back   wouldn_t recommend or purchase again   i_bought_this to_make_smoothies  and_the_first two came out great  but_when attempting to_make the third  consecutive days  not_all on_one_day   the_motor started smoking and almost started a fire in_my kitchen  i_did_not overload it or use_anything different in_the smoothies  it_was such_a_huge disappointment and waste of_money   not worth you    bucks   invest in something more powerful_and_something_that lasts  worked well to_start with but_it lasted for 3_months only  over it  looks_like_the_company  hamilton beach  will take some time_to respond to_my complaint as_it_has_been_a_couple_of days_now  the_product_had_a warranty of 3 years but_the_company s ignorance after just 3_months is kinda turning me off                  reducing rating to 1 star as_all efforts to reach customer support have_been in vain for last 4 days  thank god that we_have_amazon backing it_for us     leaks from_the_bottom after 2 months  initially really_liked this_blender because_it_was_easy_to_make_my smoothie in_the to_go cup_and head out_the door  however  after using daily for two months  it_has started leaking from_the_bottom  doesn_t matter whether i_use_the_cup or the_larger assembly    i_thought i might not_be tightening it enough so_i_was extra careful to_make_sure the seal was tight but_the_same thing happens when my_husband_uses it   disappointed  this_product worked_great_for_all_of 3 days  i_received my package on friday  march 3rd  in_the afternoon  on saturday morning i_made_a berry smoothie and_it_worked_great  the_same happened for monday_and tuesday  on wednesday morning while making my peach and mango smoothie  the_motor started smoking and_the smell of burning plastic permeated my house  i_am extremely disappointed as_i_have_had several hamilton beach products and_they_all worked just_fine  unfortunately i_would_not purchase this_product again   it_didn_t blend well_for_me     i m doing the green smoothie cleanse and_the ingredients needed_to_make several of_the smoothies would_not_all blend in_the_blender  due_to_being to small  i_had_to_blend the ingredients in 2 parts and_then mix together  due_to some ingredients_not_being broken down  processed i e   frozen strawberries and bananas  the_cups  smoothie containers were efficient  however_if a lid or cover for_the opening would_be_better for travel  had_to_purchase a_different smoothie  blender due_to_the longer process in_the morning of having_to_blend the ingredients in batches  then together   i_never thought that_someday_i_will give a negative      i_never thought that_someday_i_will give a negative feedback_to a product that_amazon sells  i_received the_product today_and just opened the_box_and pluged it  i_just press the on button_once to_blender my shake and pofff  product burned instantly and never worked again  i_couldnt used_this_product_even once  please do_not_buy_this_blender_in_any circumstances  i_ve_never seen that much low quality product in_my life   this_blender was completely disappointing  its cheap  not      this_blender was completely disappointing  its cheap  not just in price_but_in quality  everything_is plastic  you_can find other blenders for_the_same price that everything_is glass and_its going_to_be_a_lot more durable  it broke when_it tried_to_blend the ice for_a_smoothie  so on_the_second time_i_used_it it broke  not durable for_smoothies   piece_of junk      absolutely awful  first_one we ordered arrived with_a rattle sound  turns out_the_motor was_already broken into pieces before_it_shipped  got_a_replacement one and truly only_used_it_for_smoothies_with fresh fruit  not_even frozen_fruit_and after 3_months it just died suddenly  the_motor won_t_even work anymore   broke down within 3_months   broke down within 3_months of buying the_product  waste of_money  buy something_else   gasket malfunction no response from_amazon  do_not_buy_this_blender  the gasket  on which the_blades_are attached  popped out after the_second time_i_washed it  i_have_been contacting customer support and have_had_no replies on how_to resolve the_issue or go about returning for_a_refund  in_addition  the container is_a_very thin plastic  it_took very long for this_blender to_blend  even_without my issue i_don_t_think the_blender_is worth_the_price_i_paid   so disappointed      i purchase this_item off of amazon  i_used_it_for_smoothies_and soups  it_started smoking after using_it less_than 10 times  so disappointed and this company does_not_have_a return policy  wish_i_had known that before hand  smoking motor  i so excited to receive my blender and thought hamilton beach was_a_good brand but_i literally only_used_this_blender 5 times before_it_started smoking and_the_motor went out  very dissatisfied and disappointed  cheap_and not_recommended  feels cheap_and_the_bottom part that_s under the_blender where_you connect it to_the_blender_for it to spin fell off   five_stars  junk really junk  used four times_and each time stunk like electric wires burning even_with_no load   to late to_return  wish_i_used_this_item in_the return timeframe   don_t waste_your_money    about_the_only_thing_it_is_good_for is_just blending protein_powder and water or      this_product_is worth about  10 00  it_doesnt blend frozen_fruit  your fruit_comes out still in frozen hunks  it_is loud  about_the_only_thing_it_is_good_for is_just blending protein_powder and water or milk  forget spinach  because_it_is_still large soggy peices that come out  this costed  40 and_its_a pos   it_s been exactly 6 months   my blender base is      it_s been exactly 6 months   my blender base is smoked out  i_don_t use_it everyday   i_was simply blending my black beans   mushrooms before_it_started_to smoke  literally smoke was coming from_the control buttons as_well as underneath  i_ve tried_to_find replacements  nothing    i m thinking of simply calling the manufacture  hopefully this didn_t happen to all_of_them   stop  do_not_buy_this_product   i_never do reviews but_i_have_to warn you guys  this_is the_worst buy i_have_ever made in_my life  never buy_this_product  it damaged just six months after_i_purchased it  spend your_money on something better   not_recommended  lasted less_than 2 weeks  it_had_a_bit_of a burning smell when doing shakes but_when_i_tried cheese  as per the_instructions  it completely smoked  not_recommended   you_get what_you_pay_for  the_way_its built the_cup sometimes doesn_t sit_right so when_you turn it on it jumps up off_the_base  what happened to_me is_that_it jumped up_one to manu times_and knocked out all_the_rubber teeth that connects the_blade to_the_base  save yourself the heartache because when_it_worked it_was wonderful  on_a positive note amazon returns could_not_be easier   one_star  this can_t mix a think  instead_of sending it_back i throw it_out  
common sense   maintenance   it may_be clich  but_it_seems common sense is uncommon  prior to purchasing my_first nuti ninja as_a family christmas gift last_year i poured over_the_reviews of various products here on_amazon_and_there_seemed_to_be_a common_theme_among the negative reviews  sanitation_and leaks  after using my blender_for_the better part_of 10 months i_ve come_to a conclusion   1 don_t overfill  2 clean_the seal  i_m_sure all_of us at some point have_been guilty of over filling a conventional blender and_the result is material fit_for_a comedy  if_you_disintegrate a_solid object into_a billion pieces it_s going_to_take up more space  the_blender will_become_a pressure vessel   hydraulic forces will find_a way out  don_t over fill this or_any blender_for that matter  i suppose too if_the_base is cross threaded it won_t form a proper seal  if_you look_at_the_reviews of_all brands of blenders there_is_a common thread to all_the negative comments  are all blenders poorly designed  not_likely  it more plausible to_me that_a certain percentage of folks either ignore the_directions or_are_in such_a hurry they over fill the container  of_course there_is the possibility a individual product_is defective but_that_s going_to happen regardless of brand  the_second big issue seemed_to_be cleanliness   sanitation  in_my_opinion not_only is the seal removable on_the_ninja but_it_is_absolutely imperative that_you_do so  no amount_of soap and water is going_to_clean around_the seal  once_you_see how_it_is constructed i_m_sure_you_ll agree  i_guess they_re fragile if_you go digging it_out with_a buck knife but don_t do_that   use_the correct tool  again_this_issue is_not unique to_the_ninja but common with many blenders  the seal on_the_ninja is_not_an o ring or flat gasket style   it_s a 8mm wide silicone 1mm thick pcompression seal and with_a_little care can_be removed allowing for proper cleaning of_the seal and_its seat  and replacement seals are available if_it_does get damaged over time  i located scores of sellers online  once a_week at_a minimum i_use_a dental style pick tool to carefully lift the seal out_for_a thorough cleaning  once_you pull that_seal out_and observe how_it_s made_it_all makes sense  so  don_t put too_much stuff in it and take 5_minutes a_week to_clean_the seal and you_ll_be golden  now on to_the good stuff  for_a personal blender_in_a pregnant category where many sell for  200 00 to  400 00 this comes_in_at_the_low end_of_the_price_range but appears_to_have good_quality_control using_the_same materials as higher priced designs  the_walls of_the blending cups_are thick as_are the stainless blades  another feature i_noticed was the where_the_motor drive mates with_the_blade cap  the latter is_made_of a softer material that_absorbs shock rather_than transmitting it thru the drive assembly reducing the chance of fractures  no it_s_not quiet by any stretch of_the imagination but_the vast majority of_the_noise seems_to_be produced by_the blending process_not the_motor itself  i_read a_review by one poor_soul who s unit belched sparks out_the_motor ventilation ports  needless to_say an isolated issue  in summary  i_ve_used my_ninja for 10 months on_average 6 days pre week  i_ve put every combination of foods in from ginger root to grapes   yogurt to yucca   cucumber to cranberries  peanuts to passion fruit_and with_the proper ratio of solid to liquid filled to_the correct level i_can honestly say_i_ve_never_had_a_problem   i_ve concocted some nasty tasting mixtures i_ll never do_again but_the_ninja still looks   performs like_new  i_m_a_very skeptical customer and was_in_a quandary about which blender to_buy  every brand was on_the table  oster bruan vitamix jamba juice blendtec nutribullet and believe me i_have_no_problem returning a sub par product but_this_little guy has given me no reason to_say anything but good things  there_s literally millions of_these out_there being used by every variety of person_and_the odds are_some will_have_a_bad experience  is the vast majority that love_these   haven_t_had_an_issue wrong  or is it more likely the_few that for_whatever reason had_a_bad experience are upset and vocal  common sense tells you the answer  even rolex has_its critics  one last thing  the 32oz cup is_a handy addition_to consider  i_can_easily make drinks for three in_one shot   be done with it  i_received nothing_in return for_my_review  i_am in no_way associated with_this_product  i_am_a 56 year_old retired truck driver  i_highly_recommend_this_product   user friendly  this_was worth every penny  and_i_feel_like i_got so_much_more_for_my money  having_also owned other  significantly higher priced juicers and mixers  this_one_is more compact  looks good on_the counter  is way easier_to_use_and_clean  and makes quick work of_any ingredients you_put_in it  i_love you_just screw off_the_blade lid  rinse it  and_then screw on_the regular cap  and_go  this_is_no sissy blade  either  go ahead  put whatever you_want in it  and watch it grind it_up_with ease  i add nuts  seeds  frozen_fruits_and veggies  protein_powder  and literally  within seconds  i_have_a_fantastic drink to_go  love_the large and medium containers  so_i_can make enough_for two days  if_i_want  love_this_machine  and_i_could_have_bought 12  yes 12  of_them_for_what_i_paid_for_my_other mixer  which now sits in_the_bottom counter  taking up space  because_it_s too large and bulky  and really hard_to_clean   the

over weight_and tired all_the_time_and_i_knew i_had_to eat better  so_i_bought the_ninja  i buy frozen_fruits_and veggies  add vanilla yogurt and cranberry juice  ice and yummy i m eating healthy and_i_love_it  i_don_t know why the smoothies taste good_but cooked beggies are yucky to_me  i_ve lost weight_and_i_m feeling great  i_recommend trying  update  i_bought_this july 2016  its_now jan 2018  i_use_my_ninja every_morning to_make_a_smoothie for breakfast_and drink on_my way_to_work  i_use twice on saturday_and sunday for breakfast_and lunch and_it_still works_like i_bought_it yesterday  due_to making fruit_and vegetables smoothies everyday_i_ve_been eating healthier and lost 25 lbs since_i_bought   i_have_not exercised  just diet changes  i_love_my_ninja  the_seller too as_it_came_in two days as_i_m_a prime member and_the_packaging was_great  no damage   but_it_is_really super_easy_to_use_and practical for quick breakfast shakes  very much still learning about_this_product  but_it_is_really super_easy_to_use_and practical for quick breakfast shakes  last night my hunny made salad with romaine  arugula  radish  scallion  evoo and a touch of sesame oil  half he put_on_a plate the_other half went into_the mixing cup a_small amount_of good chicken broth was_added because_of_the need for liquid  and pulsed a_few times  we both drank the_end product  it_was_good and_would_be good_for_anyone_who has trouble chewing or swallowing  like_after dental procedures  etc  we will keep experimenting  you_are most limited only by your imagination or lack_of it   lovely kitchen tool  i_love a simple frozen banana and almond milk smoothie in_the mornings  this_blender_is_great_for frozen bananas  you could definitely make banana_nice cream  super_easy_to_use_and_the cleanup is_so nice  the_only_reason i_need_a_blender now_is for hot things  everything else goes in_the_bullet   i_liked the_first_one so_much i_bought_a_second      i_liked the_first_one so_much i_bought_a_second for_the office  i_am on_a meal replacement plan that requires making a shake four times a_day  this_one_is_perfect  crushes ice and frozen_fruit perfectly  works_well every_time  my_only_complaint_is the_lids are hard_to_get on  you_have_to_be sure they_are lined up perfectly before putting in on_the_base to_blend  the will screw in slightly crooked and_then will leak  often i_have_to_put_it on_and off a_few times to_get_it lined up just right  but a minor issue  still highly_recommend   a mighty blender_in_a mini package  i_don_t understand_the complaint that_it_is  manual   it_is_so powerful that_your pressure on_the vessel is_only for seconds to_get_a_perfect smoothie or blended soup  i_also own the_larger ninja professional bl660 blender_in_another location_and can attest to_the_fact_that while this nutri ninja pro is less powerful  for it_s compact size_and single blade design it_is_still a winner  while you_don_t_have the variability of_the_larger ninja s multi speed controls  imho a_lot_of that_stuff is_really overkill anyway  highly_recommended for smaller venues or for single folks where_the_larger ninja is_not_appropriate   one_of_my_favorite products of_all time  myself and my roommate used_this_blender every single day multiple times until we lost the_base  i_know  how does a person even do_that   so_i_purchased_this_one and_it_s perfect  if multiple people use_it  you might want_to_get_a_few more_of_the_cups but_i_have 0 complaints  also_the_price on here is_much cheaper than_in stores   great smoothie maker  so_far this_is_great  i m using_it daily  it_s easy_to_use_and super_easy_to_clean  it_blends easily_and makes_great smoothies   don_t see any reason to_buy_a_more_expensive model   bought_this_and_some spare cups as_a birthday present for_my_daughter  it_s been   6 weeks and she is using_it a_ton  she gets recipes off_the_internet  make_it_up the night before and_puts the_cup_in_the fridge  in_the am  she just blends and brings the_cup_with her to drink on_the_way_to her summer job  we_bought_this_because_it_was_a_much_better price_point than others we looked at   so_far we don_t see any reason to_have paid more  we asked her if_there_is_anything she wished were different or better about_it and she thought for_a_second and_then said   nope  this does exactly_what_i_wanted    amaxing small heavy_duty machine  this_blender_is_amazing  i_did my research before purchasing this_machine  i_have_not_had_a_problem_with leakage  tends to happen if_you fill it past the max fill line   always blends ingredients very_well_and_the_cups_are sturdy  the_blades_are_really sharp so please be_very careful when cleaning them  i_have_had_a_few minor cuts due_to this lol  the_machine is slightly noisy however_it_does_not_affect my usage of_the_machine  great machine for_an amazing price  since_i tend_to utilize 3 5 days per week i_have_to bleach the_tops  even_after washing them thoroughly with dish soap and hot water  due_to_them smelling sour  i_think_i_will purchase more cups and lids lol   soooo quiet compared_to magic bullet   i live in_a place where others are asleep when_i leave and arrive at odd hours  so the magic bullet was_a nightmare  this_is_about_a quarter the_volume of noise    other_than that_i d say_it_s better built  and so are the_cups  the_lids are heavy_duty and hold tight  there_s an overall sense of_weight that tells me that basically the magic bullet is_a volkswagon bug    awesome for college but needs to_be replaced part by part  and this_is_a tundra   haul your stuff and don_t worry_about_the sand_and puddles    great_for making healthy smoothies  works infinitely better_than_a_blender and_is uber fast in pulverizing fruits_and vegetables  easy_to_clean in_the dishwasher but make_sure_you handle the_blades carefully   they_are_very sharp  love_it   works_as_advertised  so_far  so_good  very effective  thorough  and quick in making smoothies  i_use mine every_day_in_my cancer fighting regimen and_i_m beating that little devil with_the help of_this ninja  came quite well_packaged but minus the_two sippy cups the_box said were within   love_it except for_the recipe book  after one week of_use  we love_this nutri ninja pro  the one we_bought came_with_a_larger and smaller cup  the grinding action is fabulous and frozen_fruits_are no obstacle for it  the recipes in_the_included book are_pretty yuck but we ve_been making up our own recipes  for_example pina colada  frozen pineapple  organic coconut milk  lime juice  and bananas  delish   truly amazing   i_was_really not_expecting so_much power from_this  it_is truly amazing    if_you_don_t_have this in_your life then get_it  it_blends smoothly  you_can feel the_power when_it_s on_and your hands are_on it  the_cups_are_very big_and awesome_as_well  you_can blend a_lot  easy_to_clean  it_s a_little loud so just keep that_in_mind if_you_want_to_blend at 10 00pm   i absolutely_love_this    amazing little machine  even better_than what_i imagined after_reading tons of reviews  it_is_very  very_sturdy_and built of heavy_duty materials  including the_blades and_the_cups  i_did read all_the_directions  which_i_recommend  and have_not_had_a_bit_of trouble  it_comes_with_a_great recipe book and complete directions  it_even shows you how_to stack the_cup for best performance  i_have made some great smoothies  just read all_the_directions and take good care of_your blender        you_will_be well rewarded   i_love_this darn machine  i_love_this darn machine  i_used_to_have_a  20 blender  then_i_got_this  no looking back  i make daily smoothies  use_it_for hummus  and basically anything a food processor would do  grinds down ice  frozen_fruit  garbonzo beans  you name it  crazy fast  my_only gripe is_that_the_cups_are wide and don_t fit_in standard cupholders  feels like_a silly design oversight   great_product  used daily  pulse it like_the_instructions say   purchased_this_as_a_gift_for_the guy who rents a room from me  he uses it every night  i_ve_used_it once or twice  i_believe the_instructions say to pulse blitz it  i_believe that_s why_i_had heard complaints of similar products overheating  this model has_a thermal fuse  so_if_it_does overheat  it_should protect the_product_and force the user to allow it to cool before continuing  that_s never happened to him or i though   great_for_smoothies   while nowhere near as_amazing as those vitamixes are  this_thing_is_a beast when_it_comes to smoothies  the_only drawback is_that_it_s incredibly loud  so_you_may wake people up if_you_re making a_smoothie at 5 30 am  it_blends up berry seeds really_well  i gag when seeds hit my tongue while drinking a_smoothie  i_have texture issues    not_a_problem_with_this_little beast   love_it   glad_i_purchased   huge upgrade from_the magic bullet thingie   excited to_use_this for_smoothies_and so  so_much_more   exactly_what_i_wanted  when_i_made the decision to_purchase this  i asked myself what_i_would honestly be using_it_for  i looked back over_my past few years when_i lived with roommates and decided that_i_really only_used_this_item for_smoothies_and mixed drinks  with that  i_knew that_i_didn_t need the full kitchen set but_i_am excited to_see i_can_do so_much_more_than just smoothies_with_this_one  the recipe book was_a_great surprise as_i_didn_t see that when_i_purchased it and_i_am looking_forward to_pairing this with_my_ninja coffee bar system to_help me lose weight_and_feel great_as_i start the_next chapter of_my life   quick_and convenient  love_it  so_much_better_than having_a regular blender  i stopped making morning smoothies because_it_was such_a_pain to_clean_the_blender cup_and blades every_time but with_this it_is_really_easy and fast  it_blends really_well too   highly_recommend  got_this to_replace_the giant size ninja_blender  which_is_really terribly awful at making smoothies  this ninja pro  however  is_awesome for making smoothies_and_i officially love_it  quick_and_easy_to_use  the scale of_this_is_actually funny       the_motor_and housing_are huge and_the_cup itself is_small     but_i_guess it_takes a_lot_of real estate to_keep a motor that powerful inside     love_this_and highly_recommend_it   smoothies every_morning   i_am really enjoying the_ninja  even my_husband_is on board  we_have experimented with lots_of fruit veggie combos  i_have_a_smoothie every_morning  the_ninja is powerful_and truly  smooths  everything from spinach to ice  i_ve_never_had_a lump of_anything_in_my smoothie  the fill line is_and absolute  don_t go over_the_line and you_will_not_have_any_problems_with leakage  love_it  it_was definitely a_great choice   love_it   i_bought_this back_on 10 30 2016 and_i_still love_it  i_just used_it this morning to_make_a shake  it_s powerful_and blends really_well  it_s a_little loud  but  most  if_not_all blenders are  i definitely_recommend_this_product   5_stars couldn_t be_better  the_ninja_blender_is one_of_the_best blenders on_the market right_now from making smoothies to frozen margaritas_it_is_a_great machine  it_comes_with_a_very detailed recipe book that_will_have you trying_to new drinks for months  the_power in such_a_small machine that takes up little space is what sets it apart from_the_rest_of_the field   great way_to boost calorie on kids that_are picky eaters  got_this primarily for_my_kids  sometimes they_don_t want_to eat so making smoothies of fruits  yogurt and nuts is healthy  taste good and keeps their calorie intake up  powdered peanut butter and dried egg whites are_good ways to_get_the needed protein in_their diets too  frozen_fruit_works_great because_you_don_t_have_to_worry_about_it going bad and_also makes_the smoothie nice_and cold  great_product so_far and have_been_using_it_for_a_couple months on_a daily basis   yes yes yes why did i not_get_this_sooner  i honestly do_not know why_i_did_not_get_this_sooner  last_year i_got on_a morning smoothie kick and have_a normal ninja which_i_love  but_it_was such_a hassle cleaning out every_morning for just one smoothie  this_is fab  i make_my smoothie and_then rinse off_the_blade and pop the travel lid on_and_i_am out_the door to_work love_love love  purchase this_and you_will_not regret it   i blend fresh and frozen_fruits_and spinach and_it pures beautifully   this_thing_is_a beast   my boss bought one_of_these_for_the office  because she and her husband drink a_lot_of protein shakes  as do_i   for_over_a_year  it_has_been used on_an almost daily basis  some days as many as 4 or 5 times  and_has held_up like_a champ  a_couple_of us like to_make our shakes thick  and_use_a_lot_of ice   lately i_ve noticed it_takes a_little longer to_blend everything  but_i_think_it_s to_be expected that_the_blades might_be getting dull after_a_year of grinding ice  on here now shopping for that   looks_like i_can replace_the_entire blade assembly for_less_than  20  happy customer   love_it   i_love_this_blender  i_never used my_old blender  but_now with_this_one i make_smoothies for breakfast several times a_week  it_is fast_and only takes a minute to_blend everything  i_have_also put crushed ice in it and made shaved ice  i_don_t use_the to_go cup lids  i pour my smoothie into_a disposable cups to drink on_the drive to_work  once_i blend my smoothie i_just rinse the_cup_and blades with water and leave them_out_to dry to_use tomorrow  my go_to smoothie is half of a ripe frozen banana  half a cup of frozen blueberries  half a cup of vanilla soy milk  or_any milk type  and half a cup of water   fast  quiet  blends everything_i_ve thrown at it   blends everything  fast  quieter than_my normal size blender  and_the travel cups_are awesome for quick morning smoothie blend and_go  the recipe book has some nice tasting options too  always nice_to_try a_different mix  update  one month in_and this continues to impress  i_will_have_to_look_into_their bigger versions so the missus and_i_can both use_it_in_the morning  i_ve blended carrots  spinach  and_other leafy greens without_issue using very little water or juice in_my_smoothies   love_it   strong blender  works_as_advertised  i_like_it_s simple function_and quick blend ability  i_use_it to_make_smoothies_and pulverize cooked   steamed vegetables to create a sauce to  disappear  in food so my toddler doesn_t refuse to eat because she sees an icky bit_of carrot or other vegetable  the_size_of_the_blender and blending cups is prefect for_my family of two adults and a toddler   ninja works   this_blender was_my final decision_after_reading countless reviews  i_ve made_a_smoothie at_least twice a_day since receiving this_blender and_i_have_nothing but great things to_say  the_ninja is_so_easy_to_assemble and_use  within five minutes i_was ready to_make_my_first smoothie  the_blender hardly takes up any space on_my counter and_cleaning after use_is_so simple  i_love_the_cups that_came_with_the_ninja  which_makes my mornings hassle free  the_price_is_great_and_you_cannot go wrong   works_great   i_love_my nutri ninja pro  it_works so fast_and makes_an incredible smooth shake in seconds  i_use_it every_morning  it_s super_easy_to_clean  i_never use_my blender any more  my go_to shake is ice  almond milk  protein_powder  a banana  and peanut butter  it_takes me under 2 minutes_to whip up_and_i_have_my morning shake to_get my day started when_i m in_a hurry  i_have_also made my_kids some delicious fruit_smoothies in it and_they love_it too   works_well  really loud   after_about_a_month of almost daily use   we re pleased_with how this performs  blends pretty_much anything quickly_and smoothly  it cleans up_in_the dishwasher pretty well  as_long_as_you_don_t let smoothie junk dry in it first  it_is louder than our last two blenders   noticeably  if noise is_a concern  i e  living in_an apartment with paper thin walls   think twice about_this_blender  otherwise  if performance is your goal   this_is_a winner  we purchased_this_because_it_was one_of_the_best personal blenders according to america s test kitchen testing  and_we ve_been pleased_with_the_purchase  pros  it_works_well  blends pretty_much anything and_everything quickly_and smoothly cons  its really loud if_i_could change anything about_this_product  make_it quieter packaging type  retail packaging   full color printed box  just_what_you_d get from_any brick and mortar store if_you found_this_review helpful   please click the  yes  button below this_review_indicating so   thanks   maybe my best purchase ever on_amazon  absolutely_love_this_product  so_easy_to_clean  takes 30 seconds from using_it to leaving it clean to dry  it_has literally changed my diet and lifestyle  have lost 10  of_my body weight in 3 weeks using_it_for_at_least one meal a_day  works for everything  i_even use_it to scramble eggs  fun to_use with_the_kids and_i save money not using_the drive thru anymore  its fun using fresh ingredients to_make up random concoctions  chops extremely efficient and fast  i_have_bought_two  one its quite_a_bit more quiet than_the_other   great_product     ninja_blender works better_than_all_of_the_other ones on_the market   ive bought 3 different name brands and this_one_is by_far the_most solid  the blending cups_are thicker and sturdier    the blending blades_are_also sturdier    i_used_to_have_to_blend for 30 45 seconds  which_was_not_at_all a_problem but would_not make shake worthiness   this_one_is 10 seconds and_i_can blend almonds into_my shake  i truly enjoy this_little machine    follow instructions and_go     i_cant find_a thing wrong with it   as stated in_my_headline i_can_t find_a thing wrong with it  the_designers knew what_they_were_after when designing this_product  it_does a_great job with everything that_it_says it_will do_and_it_does_it very efficiently  cleanup is_super simple  in less_than_a minute  before_i workout  i fill half full with_frozen strawberries  a_small banana  a 2 scoops of protein_and fill to_the_line with water  process with 6 8  2 second pulses and my post workout drink is ready  drinking this while driving  as_apposed to eating individual items  while driving is_much less distracting and no accidental messes   love   i_love_this_thing  small_but mighty  i_have_been looking_at_this model for_a_while now but on black friday_i pulled the trigger  i initially purchased_this_for_my toddler who_is the_world s pickiest eater  the thought was_i_would_be_able_to sneak some nutrition into him via_smoothies  and although he seems_to like_them i_love_them even more  they sell frozen organic fruits_and veggies at walmart so assembling the stuff to_make_smoothies is easier than ever  it_s simple to_use_and_i toss the parts in_the dishwasher when_i m done  i d say go_for it  even if_you_use_it once and a_while_the_price can_t be beat_and_it_s uses are many   blends like_a pro  love_it  i make daily protein shakes with milk  protein_powder  fruit  peanut butter  and_ice  this blends it_all quickly_and thoroughly  why did i wait_so_long to_get_this   great_blender  very convenient that_the_cups you blend      my protein spinach smoothies are as smooth as can_be now  no_more gross chunks  great_blender  very convenient that_the_cups you blend in_are the_ones you_drink out_of_and that_there_is_a_smaller and larger size  perfect_for_my_husband_and_i   blends everything to a smooth consistency  this_is_an upgrade from_my magic bullet  which_i_also love but which often left chunks of unprocessed fruits  this_one makes my drink completely smooth  just be sure_you_have the_lid screwed on tightly when_you_use   cuts like_a ninja  but_not silent like one  in_the_few weeks i_have_owned the_ninja  i_have_been drinking more smoothies than_i_have in years  it_is compact_and_easy_to_clean  it_is loud  so make you smoothies in_the evening to avoid waking up the family or neighbors  as_long_as_you_do_not fill the_cups above the marked fill line the_ninja does a_great job in tearing up whatever food stuff i_put_in it  if_it maintains it_s performance in_the long term then_i_will consider this_one_of_the_most useful purchases i_have made   good smoothie maker  i_like_the_way_it whips up smoothies very_easily  love_it_s ease  i_had leaking on_the_blade lid on_the_side that goes into_the_blender  i_m_not_sure why this_is happening unless a washer or_something has gone bad  i called ninja at 877 646 5288 and_they_are sending me_a_new blade  great company standing behind their products  thank_you  well_worth_the_money     unbeatable for_the_price  gone through several  quality  blenders and this_is the_best  very_well constructed  i_use_it_for blending the morning smoothie and  although_it_sounds a_bit like_a cement mixer  it_really does the_job  looking_for_a_quality blender at_a reasonable price   this_is it   great_product  bought_this_as_a_gift_for_my_son_along_with_additional cups and lids  he uses it every_day_and loves it  i_also ordered another as_a_gift_for_my elderly father who needed_a nutrition boost after losing his_appetite due_to having major surgery  he basically drank smoothies rather_than solid food  it_was_a_great help       a_review to_make_sure_i_could get_a_good use out_of it before writing a_review  i_want_to_say_that_i waited a_few_months of using_the_blender before writing a_review to_make_sure_i_could get_a_good use out_of it before writing a_review  my_wife and_i_love_the_blender  we went with_this_one because_of_the stronger motor in it and_i_am glad we did  it_has_no trouble blending anything we put_in it  just make_sure_to_put enough liquids in_there to actually blend  we will probably have_to_buy more cups for it_since we both like_the big one it_comes_with  only downside is to_clean it you_have_to_remove_the_rubber ring that_sits_around_the_base of_the_blade and_its hard_to_get to  when_you finally lift it_up its pretty gross whats inside so_i_recommend cleaning often if_you_use_if a_lot  otherwise great_product  we_bought_it_for black friday_and_got_a_good_deal on it   excellent  though not quite perfect  lots_of power  easy_to_use  i_like_that_there_s_no power settings   just_add ingredients and blend  easy_to_clean  cons  sometimes you_have_to_work awhile to ensure the_blades_are screwed on square  as_they want_to_be cocked a_little  which leaks  if_you_don_t pay attention   and  i_would_have preferred the_same size cups  rather_than two different sizes  happy_with_my_purchase   perfect_for frozen_fruit  after looking_at several blenders i_decided_to_go with_this_one and_i_am happy i_did  i_have other ninja products and this_one works just_as_well as the_other products i_have_had for_years  we use_this daily for_smoothies_with_frozen_fruits_and_we_have_never_had difficulty using_it  it_is_easy_to_use_and_clean  there_is_nothing else i_could ask for in_this_product_and_i hope it lasts as_long_as_my regular blender   great  easy_to_use  i_love_this device  so_far ive_used_it_for_smoothies  great texture   making real whipped cream  and making organic salad dressing  easy_to_use_and easier_to_clean than_my blender  i_love_that_it_has two sizes of containers and two sturdy  useful lids   this_blender_is_perfect_for morning smoothies  this_blender_is_perfect_for morning smoothies  i_love_that_it_comes_with two different size cups  one_for_me_and one_for_my_husband  and_i_love_that_is makes for_easy cleaning  compared_to a_large blender that_you_d have_to_take_apart and wash right after using   it definitely still makes some noise for being a_single blender_but_it_s_not_so_noisy that_it_s bothersome  haven_t_had_an_issue_with it not crushing ice or blending fruits veggies  would_recommend   works_great_for frozen_fruit_and fresh veggies  didn_t_expect to like_this_as_much as_i_do  whoever first invented a type_of blender where_you_don  t have_to wash out a cup_and blender_is_a genius  nothing easier_to_use than this_and_works_fine with ice  frozen_fruit  carrots  beets  anything_i_ve thrown in it_so_far  glad_i_bought_it   this_blender_is_awesome  i_am in love  this_blender_is_awesome  i_am in love  i_actually borrowed my friend s bullet  competitor to_the_ninja  recently and was floored by how crappy it_was compared_to_my_ninja and_amazon has_a_very competitive price compared_to retail  this_thing rocks  so_far  so_good   this_thing_is_awesome  i_ve_been throwing in_a cup of yogurt  frozen_fruit_and_some milk and voila    instant fruit_shake that_s deeeeelish  super quick_and_easy cleanup_too    next i_gotta try some ideas_in_the recipe book that_came_with it   mom loves shakes  bought_this_for_my mom and she made smoothies for everyone lol  she loves it  i_bought 5 months_ago and although she doesn_t use_it as_much as the_first few weeks but she uses it often to_make healthy shakes   i_love_this_thing  i_love_this_thing  it_gets the_job_done  compactly and very quickly  my_only_complaint_is_that_the_motor is loud  and because_you_have_to stand next_to it to_push_it_down for it to_work  you_can_t leave the room while_it_is blending  to save your hearing    my solution is to_push_it_down with_one hand  stretching my arm and standing as far away as possible  while plugging the_ear closest to_the_blender with_my_other hand  this may sound extreme  but_i_have very sensitive ears  so_i_put this here for others who may share that_issue  that_said  i m still very_happy_with_this brilliant little blender   truly is the_best   wow  the_ninja is_really powerful  we compared how the texture of_my spouse s shake she did with_the nutri bullett 900 and she was_amazed on how_it tasted  it_was more smoother  less thick  flavor was more powerful as_it_was properly mix  the clean_up of_the_blade is_very simple and_it_has the_lid that helps her while she drives  this_is_a missing item with nutri bullett  she is even tempted to_buy the_main blender_for_her normal cooking  it_s the_best i_have_ever bought  
after blended a drink bottom_of_the_blender leaves black marks or dirts on ur table   hi there i_just_got_this_item from you and_its working fine  but_there_is_small issue every_time when_i blended some drinks underneath of blender came out black color dirts and hard_to_clean it i_dont know_what that_was but looks_like came out from blender cooling hole could you explain to_me what_it_was   i_had_to_put_a fabric under   i_would give_this_product 4_stars  but_it      i_would give_this_product 4_stars  but_it_is hard_to_remove_the gasket from_the_blade base so_you_can clean it  using_a butter knife  i_get_as far down_the_side of_the gasket as_i_can  then_i lift the gasket up until_i_can grab it  that_is the_only flaw to_the nutri ninja   out with_the_bullet  in with_the_ninja  i_bought_this when my beloved nutribullet refused_to release the_cup  i_had the_bullet for_about 8 months_and_i_loved it despite the glitches   like occasionally having_to_go_to war just to_get_the thing open  or realizing your smoothie is_all_over your walls even_though you_didn_t over fill it  but_the_bullet is_sturdy  a_bit heavy and_it_does a wonderful job blending veggies  ice  frozen_fruit  seeds and powders into_a lovely  smooth consistency  after nearly dislocating my shoulder after 3 days of trying_to_get_the_bullet to release my drink and_the drink has turned into zombie barf  i_gave up_and_the_entire thing_is in_the trash  enter the_ninja  first impression  it_s much lighter than_the_bullet and_looks chintzy  it_does_not_have the suction cups on_the_bottom which were_a wonderful touch on_the_bullet and you_have_to_hold_the_cup_in_place in_the_ninja for_the duration of_the processing  unlike_the_bullet  which allows you to walk away during_the 30 seconds of processing  the_ninja only has 1 processing option   the_bullet has 2 the_ninja s cups_are smaller_than_the_bullet  but fit_in car cup holder better  obvious pros are the_price_is less_than_the_bullet  there_is_no twisting the_cup_into_place on_the processing unit_so_there_is_no risk of_an accidental crooked twist resulting in_a locked cup_and a_lot_of_money in_the garbage   not to_mention no breakfast  the smoothie came out just_as smooth ones from_the_bullet  i_also like_the_cup lid better on_the_ninja as the_rubber stopper on_the_bullet cups kept coming off  i_love_my bullet when_it_worked and_would_have given it 5_stars if_i d written a_review 2 hours after opening_the_box like i m doing for_my_ninja  but_after discovering all_the glitches and having_to toss it_in_the trash after less_than_a_year  i d give the_bullet no stars check out some_of_the youtube videos that come up_with_the search  i_can_t open my nutribullet    the struggle is real people  get_the_ninja   very quick but doesnt completely break down everything   i_bought_this_as_a_gift_for_my_wife  she likes to_make shakes to bring to_work_in_the morning  she said_it_is_very quick_and very strong but sometimes she notices it_doesnt completly break everything down_and_it winds up leaving a_few whole bits  overall_it_works_well but_i_would leave it run for_a_few more seconds than you think_it needs just to_be sure everythings broken down   i_put_in frozen_fruits_and_it_shreds them good  not related to_the_product but  this_thing_is powerful  and exretemely loud my floor shakes  it_works thought  i_use to to_make_smoothies  i_put_in frozen_fruits_and_it_shreds them good  not related to_the_product but    originally i_bought_this_and_there_was_some issue of it being delivered and_it_was suppose to_be re delivered but_then got lost somewhere     not_sure_if usps stole this or lost it  i_had_to reorder a_new_one  so_it basically took_a_week to receive this  when_it_was suppose to_be 2 day prime   surprised  i_thought i_wouldn_t like_it more_than_my_old nutribullet  but_i_was surprised that_i_liked it better  i_like_that_you_have_to_hold down_the_cup for_the_unit to_operate  since_i_feel it_is safer because_you_can control the_blade action  also  you_don_t_have_to_worry_about_a locking mechanism  with_the nutribullet the locking mechanism was_always jamming  i_didn_t give_it a 5_star_rating because_the_unit_was_advertised as  like_new  and_the_base as_well as the_cup came_with obvious scratches   overtighten to avoid leakage   this_is the_second time_around reviewing this_item  the_first review was_not_approved  it figures  however  i_gave nutri ninja another shot  and_i realized the leaking problem in_the_lid that_i_was having while_in_use  was due_to_the_fact_that_you_have_to overtighten the_lid for it to_work appropriately  otherwise it always leaks  so with that being said  i_can deal with that  i_like_the concept of_these personal rocket type_of blenders  but_i_feel the  nutri bullet   due_to it_s removable blade assembly that has two distinct kind_of blades  offers a_little_bit more versatility  and a finer grinding  so basically  i_feel_like_it_would_be_awesome_of ninja gave also_that other blade assembly to_have better blend on harder things   little blender that packs quite_a punch   i_ve only_used_this_blender a_couple_of_times so_far but_this_little blender packs a punch  it_is_quite powerful to_blend a_smoothie right up  i_love_that_you_just fill your cup  twist the_blade on  click it_in_place and push down  it_is_easy for on_the go mornings  its_great size fits_great on_the counter so_i_dont have_to drag it_out_of cupboards everytime_i_want_to_use_it  so_far very glad_i_purchased_this_item   super smoothie blender   i absolutely_love_this_thing  it_s so_easy_to_use_and_clean  works so fast_and makes_the_perfect smoothie  incredible value_for such_a_high_quality appliance  highly_recommend  my_only_complaint_is_that_there_are no measurements printed on_the_cups  that_would_be_a_really_nice feature but_it_s_not_a_huge deal   really does a fast job of blending   did a_ton_of reading reviews on_this_thing before getting it  i_really_like_the_size_of it and that_it_comes_with 2 different sized containers  it_can whip up just_about_anything_in minutes  the_cord can_be stored underneath  cleanup is_really_easy by adding a_little soap to water and_running the_blender  only_complaint_is the_noise  it_is_quite loud  otherwise nice quick_and_does the_job  i_can even make hummus in_this_thing  
decent blender  horribly over packaged  the_blender_is decent  good stuff  easy cleanup  two mixing cup sizes with nice sealed lids  it grinds fruits_and veggies into_a_nice smooth drinkable blend  bad  the capacity of_the_larger mixing vessel is less_than_idea  at most you_can make_a_single largeish smoothie  i d prefer to_be_able_to_make two biggins at_a time  it_s excessively loud  so_much so_that_my noisy little coffee grinder shudders in fear when the_ninja begins to scream  the_packaging material used_to protect and ship this_item was over_the_top  see_the_picture  it_was_in_a corrugate box inside a double corrugate box inside still another corrugate box  plus three molded cardboard inserts and no less that_seven_assorted plastic bags and such  no wonder amazon ceo jeff bezos is obsessed with space exploration  at_this rate amazon will deplete the planet s packaging resources in no time  let s try_to_do better  meanwhile_i m_going back_to local shopping for things like_this_that distributed with reasonable consideration for_our precious planet  cheers   serves the purpose but loud as heck   so_this_is the_second time_i_am buying_this_after the_first_one stopped blending well_and became super loud after_a_couple_of years  i owned the nitri blender professional but hated it because_it_makes watery smoothies that_aren_t smooth at_all  really didn_t want_to_purchase another nutrininja but_after_reading reviews about other extractors this_one seems_like_the_best bet for_what_i_need  it_does blend smooth_and quick  however_it_is loud as heck and vibrates like_it_s_not calibrated properly  i almost wonder if this_is_a defect and need_to_be returned because_i_don_t_think_it_should vibrate the_way_it_does  almost as_if_it_isn_t stable  i_will_update after_a_bit_of usage  other_than_my_previous concerns this_blender_is ok  comes packaged well  the_cups although_i_wish were larger are_good_quality  and_the recipe booklet is informative about nutrition_and smoothie recipes   a_big disappointed   it_does the work_it_s supposed_to_do  by that_i_mean it mixes everything up_in_a_very quick manner  my_only_and big problem_with_this_is_that_it_does t have_a lock option so_it_is_really manual   i_have_to stand_there with_my hand on_top to_get_it going and keep_it going   a similar product i_used had the capability to lock the container in_and keep on mixing until_i turned it off  you probably did this for safety s sake  but_it_s nt a_great_idea for_me  otherwise  it_s fine  but_that_was_a_big big disappointment to_me_and_had i_known i_would_have looked for exactly_what_i_wanted  in other words  i_am_not explaining this well   it_doesn_t have_a lock option   it_works wonderfully  have_yet_to encounter an item it_cannot      pros  when_it_works  it_works wonderfully  have_yet_to encounter an item it_cannot blend  makes fine work of both soft ingredients  fruit  vegetable leaves  etc   as_well as harder ingredients  carrots  almonds  etc   cons  can_be difficult_to secure the_lid with_a_full bottle  can_be difficult_to_clean  especially inside_the_unit  not for_those looking_for  quiet  blenders  final  as far as single serve smoothie makers go  this does the_job just_fine   dont buy if_you already have_a_blender   i_still get fruit_stuck on_the_blades and pieces of pulp or fiber  cranberries and pineaple is what_i consume more  its just_like_a regular blender  nothing special i_does_not do what_you_see on_the_tv ad  no it wont  disolve  fruit nor seeds_nor nuts    i_still find it practical as_a travel blender  i_am_a contractor_so_im away_from home_all_the_time  but definitely not what_you_see on tv   not that much_better_than_the less expensive bullet  i replaced a failing bullet believing i_was getting_a far greater unit_in both performance and durability  from_the_first use_this_unit leaks and didn_t perform significantly better_than_the less expensive bullet  i_will keep_it but was_not_as happy_with_the results as_i_was hoping for  additionally  as others have pointed out_the_base of_this_unit_is_very hard_to_remove when hot liquids are being blended  my_wife uses this for bullet coffee every_day  she is_very strong and_still needs me_to_open this up for_her occasionally  since_it_is_so hard_to_remove_the_fact_that_it_still leaks is_a mystery     loud  but does the trick   super loud  but does the trick  i m embarrassed to_make shakes in_the morning for fear that_i_ll wake up my neighbors in_my apartment building  i_m_not exaggerating  it_s loud   but_i_really enjoy the single serve aspect of_this_blender and how fast it_blends my_smoothies  read many reviews about not over filling to avoid leaking  and_i_haven_t_had problems since_i m conscious of not over filling  oh yeah  did i mention it_s super loud  you ve_been warned   like  chainsaw in_your kitchen loud  i_was excited to receive this_because_my magic bullet finally perished after_a_long and satisfying career  unfortunately i_m_not_as_impressed as_i d hoped to_be  to_start  this_blender_is loud  like  chainsaw in_your kitchen loud  but ok  i_thought i d be so_impressed_with it_s blending ability i_could look past that  not_so     it_doesn_t completely pulverize all_ingredients as promised  no_matter_how_long you run the chainsaw    er blender   it leaves bits_and pieces behind for_a gritty smoothie  bummer   too_much trouble  i_am trying_to like_this ninja  i_used my_daughter s last_year_and_i_thought all_of_the different ones of_the_same brand_would work as_well as the one she had  mine are used several times every_day  i_have_used up 5 magic bullets in_the_last 10 years  my 5th one has just_about_had_it  so_i_started looking_at_the nutri ninja_blenders  these_are my biggest complaints with_the model i_purchased  there_is_only_one blade  i_think_it_is_a crushing blade but_i_am_not_sure what_they called it  mine is having lots_of problems crushing up frozen_fruit  it_is_very loud and_i_have_to_keep adding liquid and taking it off  opening_the_lid and stirring yet  i_always have pieces of fruit_from_the_bottom that_is_not blended  next  even_though_it_came_with two cups  they_are much larger than_i_can drink at_a time  i_saw where someone said that_you must be_careful  not to overfill it  the fill line is marked clearly on_the_cup  the_cups_are smooth_and do_not_have_a handle to_carry it with  that_is_a_big problem for_me  i_have ms and_i_do_not_always have full use of_my hands  i_have dropped the_cup full of liquid two times so_far  i_have started using_the_ninja pro to_use_as_a juicer and_then_i_have_to pour it_into one_of_my magic bullet cups that have_a handle  you_get 2 lids  just_alike  with_a spout_and a lid to_keep_it_from spilling  i_don_t know about having it_in_the_car because_the_cups_are too_big for_my console cup holders  i_am very_disappointed_with_this_purchase and_i_am considering sending it_back_and_going back_to_my magic bullet which has two kinds of blades  4 handled cups as_well as_a tall one and short one_that doesn_t have handles  i_also get_a_large pitcher for larger crowds  the nutri ninja has more power but_is it worth_the_price   i_love_it but_i_don_t_think_its that powerful for      i_love_it but_i_don_t_think_its that powerful for_a ninja and_the_price_i go by_the rules and directions and constantly have_to_open_it and move things around and_i_ve_never_had_this problem_with other machines  it_still does the_job though  and_its extremely loud but you won_t find_any that_aren_t  although_i_wish you could 
powerful but poor_quality machine  i purposely waited a_bit to write this_review to_see_if this_item would hold_up  and unfortunately it_did_not  as for_the_power and ability to_make_a_great smoothie  it_is fantastic  however  it_is_a_cheap piece_of_plastic except for_the_motor_and_wears out very_easily  the_blade assembly that_you insert into_the_motor must be situated exactly right  if_not  it_could easily strip the_unit  this_is what happened to_me  basically rendering the_unit useless  i called ninja since this_is well_within warranty but was told the_warranty was for_the_motor only_and a blade replacement was_not_available  however  they_would_be willing to_replace_the_whole unit_for_the_cost_of_the_blade assembly which_was  39 99 plus  6 99 shipping and sales tax  so basically  i_would_be paying another  49 99 for_a_replacement unit that_i_already paid  69 99 for back_in january  and probably would_not last anyway  it_makes_no sense to_me_and_i_won_t do_it   disappointing smoothie maker  pro s  inexpensive small base takes up less space blend in_the_same drinking container so_you only wash 1 container con s  no speed selection  it_s on or off_and you_need_to_push down_and hold_the container to_blend its useless if_you like smoothies on_the thicker side  the_blade design doesn_t work_well_for thick ingredients it_doesn_t  blend  very_well_and leaves clumps and chunks of unmixed ingredients  even if_you extend blend time  the_lid leaks if_it_s_not sealed very tightly it_s very noisy loud summary  i_liked the nutri bullett much_better for making thicker smoothies_and_the vitamix is the_best  but pricey    but at_first it_worked fine  and_now_i_have_to_play around with      i_can_t figure_out how_to contact seller  but at_first it_worked fine  and_now_i_have_to_play around with it to_get_it to_work  i press down_and nothing happens  this_has_been going on for_the_past couple days and_i_have only_had_this for_a_couple weeks   leaky lid  i_bought_a_new ninja because_my_old_one_started leaking during_the blending process after 3 or 4 years of_use  unfortunately  my brand_new_one leaks into_the_machine every_time_i_use_it  if_it weren_t for this i_would like_the_product because_it_blends well  i m just not_going_to_be happy spending more money replacing the_lid or the_whole system yet again   i_purchased_this_item to_replace magic bullet of 600      i_purchased_this_item to_replace magic bullet of 600 watts  the_product feels and_is durable and_does what_the_description says  from previous experience with ninja products  it only operates with constant pressure  with_this_product i sometimes have_to apply pressure several times to_turn it on_and_it_will turn_off on its own  i_think_it_s a manufacturing  defect  also  it_is_very loud and_had_to_return_it today_and purchased_a magic bullet 1000 watt   sharkninja i hope you_can help me with_the_noise problem   nutri ninja pro  bl456  this_is my third 900 watt ninja pro in four years   2 is beginning to burn out  smell for_the_last week  and because_i_use_the_ninja for_a_smoothie every_morning   primarily berries  protein_powder  half an apple cut in pieces  protein_powder and_other small odds and ends   i_got  3 so_i_wouldn_t have_to miss my_smoothies while waiting for_another blender after  2 finally goes  the_product works_well_for_me  so_i m willing to stay with it_in spite of_the relatively short longevity with regular  but light use  i_tried  3 for_the_first_time this morning and_the_noise was_so ear piercing that_it_was_all i_could do to_keep using_it the relatively short time necessary to_blend my smoothie  perhaps i_didn_t perceiver long enough  because  though blended adequately  i_don_t_think_it_was blended as_well as_my_previous ninjas  again  i may_not_have kept at it long enough    but_the_noise   also  sadly  3 isn_t made_as_well as previous ones  i_will_be returning this_one but don_t want_to_have_to_give up_on_the_product  i hope sharkninja can offer me_a quieter ninja pro 900 watt  i_do hope this_one_is_an anomaly   terribly loud  no returns policy  read_the return policy  you_cannot return_it  and_if_you live alone and don_t_have_to_be concerned about waking everyone_in_the_house  it_s ok  but_if_you happen to want a_smoothie late while you_re up working or watching tv  or_even during_the_day while your child is taking a nap  forget_it  but_i_don_t live alone  and while up late working i_made myself a_smoothie and woke everyone_in_the_house with_the terribly loud noise  when_i pressed down_on_the_top to_start it  it_scared the bejeezus out_of me  i_made the mistake of not reading the return policy  so_i m stuck with_the thing until spring when_i_can stick it_in_a yard sale  i_should ve shopped at walmart  where_i_could ve returned it  only good_for_one and half month  it_was_great_for_a_month  i_was having_a_good time for making smoothie drinks  but_after_a_month and half  it_suddenly stop working anymore  
product went bad before one year  product went bad before one year  bought protection plan  but both asurion  the_company that_sells protection plan  and_the_manufacturer both refused_to_replace since_there_is_no serial number at_the_base of_the_motor_and_also_we didn_t receive any protection plan info in_the_box   couldn_t be_more disappointed         now_i_am really peeved  this_is the_2nd nutri ninja i_have_purchased  the_first_one lasted for_a_decent amount_of_time before_it began smoking and a horrible burning rubber smell filled my house  but_i_had used_it a_lot so chalked it_up as_normal wear_and tear  debated on buying_another  but decided_to_go ahead because_i drink a_smoothie for breakfast maybe 2 3 times a_week_and_the nutri ninja does a_good_job of chopping ice  i_bought the_2nd one_in june  less_than 3_months_ago  this morning it_started smoking and that burning rubber smell happened again  so_into_the garbage it goes  will_not_be_a fool and_buy_this_product again  clearly the_design_is inferior  try a_different brand   less_than 30 days of_use_and_it_s dead   after less_than two years of very sporadic use  it_does_not_work any more  the_blender was bought to_be used_at_a location i visit ever 2 3_months for_a_week  if_you add up the total usage  it won_t reach 30days of_use  is this_blender meant to die after such low use  it_s_not the_most expensive blender  but_it_s_not cheap for such bad performance   it broke one month after the lousy warranty expired  oy vey   the_ninja stopped_working today_and so after making sure_it_wasn_t the outlet or_anything else i_decided_to_get out_the_warranty information on it  it_comes_with_a 12 month warranty  the_warranty says that_if_the_ninja breaks during_the_warranty period you_have_to_pay to_ship it to_their facility and_also_include a check for  19 95 to  cover return shipping and handling   i_was furious thinking about having_to_pay 2 3 of_the_cost_of a_new item only to_get_a factory refurb as_a_replacement  well  it just so happens that_the_ninja i_bought is 13_months old so even that lousy warranty isn_t an option  will never buy ninja brand again   will damage your hearing  the_only other blender_i_have_owned that_was this loud was_a broken blendtec that_had_to_be repaired  the_first_one_was_so loud i assumed it_was defective and_had_it replaced  the_second is_just_as bad and leaves my_ears ringing after use  i work around power tools alot and my table saw is quieter than this_blender  maybe i_got 2 duds in_a row but_that_is_as_much a reason to not_recommend_this_product as the_noise issue  by_the_way_i_have_a_blender collection_as_i_am_a_bit_of a_smoothie fiend  i_have plenty_of experience with blenders and really wanted this cheaper alternative to_be my_new goto   it_s in perfect condition but_the_motor is dead  very frustrating  i_bought_this_item in may 2017 and_used_it about 10 times_and_it no_longer works at_all  it_s in perfect condition but_the_motor is dead   blender throws electric sparks from_the_bottom  received the_item last week_and_it throws electric sparks from_the_bottom when_in_action  if_you leave a white clothes underneath then_it covers it with black residue  i_have just tried it once and_it_seems_not safe at_all  thanks to amazon s_great customer_service  i_got full refund   does_not do well_with_frozen_fruit   my_old ninja master prep was wearing out after 5 yrs or more_of_use  this_blender will_not make  smooth  smoothies_with_frozen_fruit as_well as the prep  i returned and_will order the_original   very loud   shipped timely  but machine doesn_t work properly  when_i_put_the_blender and_the container on_the_base to_blend  it_makes_a horrible loud noise and_the_base vibrates a_lot  at present i_am very_disappointed and not happy_with it  i_have other ninja products and_am very_satisfied_with_them  i_would return this   one_star  pieces don_t fit_the_machine  
great_value and decent blender_for_the_money  great_value and decent blender_for_the_money  the glass pitcher is thick and heavy_duty  the_lid fits so tight and_sturdy it_takes a_little strength to_remove until_it  breaks in  and loosens a_bit  but_that_sure beats a floppy or loose lid that doesn_t stay put when blending  i_have made several smoothies_with_frozen berries and_ice and_it_works just_fine  like_any blender  if_your mixture is_too thick and_icy  some liquid needs added to_get_it to thoroughly mix into that  whirlpool  effect from_the_bottom up  otherwise  you_have_to  pulse and spoon  the mixture down_to release air pockets and_get_it to_settle to_the_bottom_of_the_picture for mixing  this_is typical with_any blender_i_have_used however  and_i_have_owned blenders from  19 to  450  i expect to_get_a_couple years worth of smoothie and margarita mixing out_of it and_then buy_another when the_motor burns up or the gears slip  as_already stated though  i_am extremely
