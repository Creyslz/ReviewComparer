love this  great_buy  this works_great_for organizing laundry i am able_to easily fit a total of 8 laundry baskets on this and it keeps all my families clothes organized and makes cleaning them a breeze  super easy_to build  i_can hardly ever build anything and i built this with no problem  very sturdy even with 8 very full laundry baskets  love this would purchase again  nice shelf at a_great_price i_m using this 5 shelf unit in my garage for extra storage  it is well built and was easy_to assembly  i_didn_t have any problems_with bent hardware as did some of the_other reviewers  take care to_make sure you have all 4 sets of wedge clips set at the_same height  the poles have double grooves periodically to help you make sure you get all clips at the_same height  gently lower the shelf down over the wedge clips  and then push down on each shelf corner while simultaneously pushing up on the wedge clips to_make sure they don_t slip down on the pole  i accomplish this by putting my palms on the top of the shelf corner and allowing my finger tips to wrap around and touch the bottom of the clips  a_bit of squeezing together and the shelf corner rings are making good contact with the clips  keeping them together and prevent them from slipping out_of the groove on the pole  easy peasy  i put casters on the bottom of my shelf to allow me to move it around in my garage  i initially ordered casters with a metric threaded shank  m8x1 25   based on responses to product questions on the subject  however  when my shelf arrived i_discovered that the threaded inserts were actually a sae thread   3 8 16  coarse thread   so_i_ordered these casters from amazon https   www amazon com gp product b00tkqcvde ref oh aui search detailpage ie utf8 psc 1 they weren t quite as nice as the metric ones i first bought  no brakes  little more slop in the ball bearing  more expensive  etc   but they worked fine for the shelf and allow me to easily move it around on my smooth garage floor while loaded with boxes  the wheels are fairly small and probably wouldn_t work too well on rough finished concrete  i_love my shelf i_love my shelf  it s every sturdy and nice looking  holds everything_i_needed it to inorder to free up space on my counters  very_easy_to_install  very strong shelving  i_ve seen a_lot of reviews talking about how difficult it is to put the shelving together  perhaps amazon changed the design or something else is going on  but i had zero issues putting the shelf together  aside from determining how much space in between shelves i_wanted   this is super easy  1  the shelves  up  side is with the wire lip facing the floor  this lip is there to provide strength to the shelf and prevent it from bending  if you are stuck on needing a  lip  to hold your stuff in  this is_not the right shelving system for you  2  the stops for where the shelves rest on say  top  and must be installed in that direction  top toward your ceiling   they are fluted  so_if you flip them upside down  they will not hold and your shelf will not stay in place  seriously    that s all the steps involved  like i said  the_hardest thing about installation is determining where you want each shelf  total installation  including adjusting shelf heights  took less_than 15 minutes  and i am far from a craftsman  stating that  these shelves are super strong  i_use mine to store my whiskey collection  these bottles weigh a ton and the entire reason i_purchased this shelving system is because the mdf shelving i had was sagging under the weight of the bottles  i highly_recommend purchasing the shelf liners that amazon will  suggest  you purchase  there is about an inch gap between each metal wire  the shelf liner will close the gap and prevent things from tipping over and falling  i have some minis on the top shelf and there is no way in the world they would stand up without those liners  the shelf is a semi gloss black  not quite matte  definitely not shiny   it is attractive and should fit most decors  so  five_stars for a high quality product at a_very attractive price  cheers  basically amazing shelves  beware suggested shelf liners  though  as many others have already stated  these shelves are very_well built and extremely easy_to assemble  the dimensions are thankfully right on the mark  i_wanted to place 5 side by side along one wall  and had the dimensions been off by even a small_increment they would have overshot a doorway  as you can see in my photos they lined up exactly with the edge of the doorframe  which is precisely what i had intended and pre measured for  only one thing has given me any grief during this project  however  are those sterling shelf liners you see suggested in the  frequently bought together  section  although they claim to be a  perfect fit custom tailored to fit the amazon basics wire shelves by amazonbasics  they are actually about two millimeters too wide to lay properly on the shelves  this slight miscalculation causes the liners to hang over the raised lip edge and could create a slight imbalance depending on the weight of a particular item and how close it is to the offshooting edge  i_m not_sure how i_ll be able_to resolve that issue  since the shelf liners are very sturdy  as_advertised  so_it s_not as_if_i_m going_to be able_to sit down with a pair of scissors and trim all 20 of these things  but that s something that i_ll need_to_take up with sterling themselves  other_than that gear grinder  i_love these shelves   awesome  i_wanted to_get my storage bins off the floor and this was a perfect fit  easy_to put together and looks good_and is very solid  super strong and economical this is a tall set of 5 shelves which you assemble yourself using plastice brackets  8 metal poles  and 5 shelves  i will mention that this is my second set of amazon basics shelves and this_one differs in that it is taller  less wide  and black  i_loved the_first set and expected this set to be just as_good  i_m happy to_say that they are  though this_one has very slightly different construction  first of all  construction on cheap or poorly made versions of this type of shelving can be a nightmare if you re trying_to_get the shelves level  that is_not a_problem with these as they are very_well made  the plastic caps that_allow you to position the shelves and lock them in place are easy both to lock and unlock into place  they also natrually seem to click into certain spots on the ribbed poles so you can easily make sure they fit at_even intervals by finding one_of those spots on each pole nearest to the desired position  this does mean you can_t put the shelves 100  into place if you rely on these locking spots  but it does mean that you don_t have to worry about the caps slipping when leveling or placing the shelves and creating uneven shelves  my first set of amazon basics shelves didn_t have this clicking into place aspect to the caps  but i was still able_to_get them level  i think this new feature just makes it easier for people who have difficulties with this type of construction and i think it s a_good added new feature  i had no_problems at_all understanding the instructions or assembling the shelving  they did seem to omit one part  there are double sided metal screws that join the top and bottom poles that you have to screw into the assembled bottom to connect the top poles and those instructions seemed unclear or absent  my former set of shelves screwed directly into one another  i think this design is likely stronger and more stable  and may apply only to these shelves because they are taller than the_other set that i have   you do need_to supply either a rubber mallet or a hammer and some sort of cushioning cloth to gently tap the shelves into place over the caps  you can probably do it with your fist and a cloth  but it ll be a_little uncomfortable doing so  you really don_t need_to hit them hard to_get them to fit the caps  all_of the parts on these shelves are very solid with good heft  i am keeping very heavy things on my shelves  at present  about 12 cases of soda are on one shelf  and they do_not bend  sag or sway  the shelves can_take a_lot of weight  i have no doubt that they can hold at least the 350 lbs  of distributed weight that the description claims  anchoring materials are also_included should you be in a position to worry about the shelves toppling  i_can_t speak to the anchoring materials utility since_i am renting and can_t drill holes in my walls  that being said  i also don_t think the shelf is likely to tip even with an earthquake as long as you bottom load the heaviest items to help anchor the shelf  the main concern would be small children trying_to climb up it  and that s no a concern for me   some people have put up pictures of damaged shelves  i had no_problems_with mine  they were all straight with perfect paint jobs on them and no rusting issues  i_did_note that the_box took a_little damage in transit  despite being a big box within a much bigger box  so_i wonder if rough handling in transit may have created problems for some users  in terms of value  these provide an enormous amount of space and strong shelves for a bargain price  the_only weak point is an obvious one based on design  and not related to the_product s quality or construction so_it is_not a demerit as you can see the type of shelving you are getting when you make a choice to_buy these  and that is that they are open shelves so you ll need storage bins or bookends to keep certain items from falling out the sides  i_ve found that you can deal with the open metal framework on the bottom easily by cutting out pieces of cardboard and covering the bottoms of the shelves with decorative cloth  these look good_and function very_well_and i would highly_recommend them to anyone looking_for economical  high capacity  strong shelves provided that you believe you are okay with self assembly  i_ve been extremely pleased_with my first set of amazon basics shelves for nearly a year and these seem just as solid as those ones      my appliances so_i_bought this shelf which is sturdy and doesn_t occupy too much space moved into a smaller apartment and need more space to put my appliances so_i_bought this shelf which is sturdy and doesn_t occupy too much space  love them  i just got 2 of these and they fit perfectly inside the closet  i am so excited to_use these shelves  they are sturdy and easy_to put together  i_know they will be used_for a long time  i_can_t wait to have this craft business room organized  new york living   shelves needed i_love these shelves  i live in ny and with lack of closets comes a major need for storage  these shelves look good in every room  this latest one_is in my bedroom  perfect_for additional shelf space i was looking_for additional shelf space for my smaller kitchen appliances and found this item  it took less_than ten minutes to put together and is very sturdy  i especially like that you can adjust the bottom of the_unit  my tile floor is somewhat uneven and changing one side made it stop wobbling   this was just what i was looking_for  sturdy  this shelving unit is wonderful  my husband has a_lot of heavy books that just weren t fitting on his bookshelves  so_i_bought him this  we have to shelve the books sideways  but he actually likes it because now he doesn_t have to tilt his head when he s reading the titles   haha  love the brushed black finish   very sturdy            amazing love itttt   was looking_for a shelf for my son s bedroom for his tv and clothes all the dressers costs about 300 bucks this is strong perfect_for 50 bucks super easy_to put together    great set of shelves  neg review take with grain of salt okay  first of all this shelving unit is absolutely great  the_price_is great_for the_quality you get  the assembly is easy  as long as you follow directions and put the shelves on correctly  it holds my microwave  countertop devices and some dishes and pans  as to other reviews saying things are broken or it doesn_t fit together all i have to_say is read the directions so you can assemble it properly  the complaints that the plastic pieces that go on the rails to hold the shelves_not fitting together completely  that is how they are suppsed to be  they need_to have a space so they can provide pressure when the shelf is put on it  as to having to_use a hammer to_set the shelves  yes that is normal  again it needs the pressure to stay in place so_it most likely shelves won_t go on with hand pressure  as to the broken pieces loose in the_box  they are shipping shims to keep the shelves separate  these pieces are not needed for assembly  again read the directions  i saw a_couple_of pictures with crooked shelves  this is due to not having the plastic pole pieces at the_same level  use a measuring tape to be sure they are all at the_same level  there is also one picture that is all jacked up with shelves all over the place  this person assembled incorrectly  the shelves only go on one way  the four corner holes are tapered and need_to be put on the poles tapered side up  the easiest way to figure it out is the part than hangs down about an inch from the shelf should be facing down  if you put it the_other way the shelves will not go on correctly  i have assembled these type of shelves in the restaurant industry and i find a_lot of the negative reviews to be the fault of the assembler  the damaged product reviews are different  however  that is_not the fault of the_product or amazon that is 100  the shipping company  i hate when people blame amazon for something they have zero control over  overall  i recommnd these shelves  they are sturdy and have a_lot of room for storage  i_do wish they were a_little deeper  but it works_great fir my needs  great shelf for garage or indoor closet sturdy  adjustable metal shelves  great_for organizing open or closed closet space  i put this inside my small closet to put away my 14 gal  56qt    4 gal  16qt  plastic storage bins  initially i had these storage containers stacked  but the weight of top bins was cracking the bottom most bin  and causing lids to warp  in addition  if_i_needed something from bottom bin  i had to remove all the top bins first  the metal shelves allowed to all buckets bins to be separate so they don_t break from stacked weight and contents in them are now easily accessible  i_love this shelf   great  sturdy and easy_to put together  so sturdy yet lightweight and just snaps together  i_use mine in a closet to store art supplies  i have slate tiles and ceramic tiles that weigh a_lot and this shelf saves me space and holds all that weight  i_bought one that was so expensive from u line once  sturdy  multi purpose unit multi purpose shelving unit  no_complaints  it arrived_on_time_and packaged well  i was able_to quickly assemble the_unit and put it to_use  i_bought this to store items in my garage  but it looks nice enough_to_use indoors as_well  the_only difficulty i had was with the placing some of the sleeves where i_wanted  for some reason certain sets would not easily clip together  fortunately  the package came_with spare sleeves and i was able_to mix and match the pairs to fit as needed  at one point i had to readjust the middle shelf height and was able_to_do that easily as_well  great_product for the_money this_product is just what i_needed for my daughters homeschool textbooks  it is sturdy and can hold the weight with no problem  the_only pain was putting it together which really only took all_of ten minutes  it was the exact dimensions i_needed for the space i was using  i_use the top shelf for my printer and it is sturdy enough for that  modern design looks great in the home  assemble in no time  easy_to assemble nice looking shelf for kitchen closet or wherever  great_product at first i was_not_sure if_i would like a steel shelving system compared to a wooden one_in my bedroom  now they stand right next to my old sauder s shelves and they do_not look bad  comes_with a bonus that i_do_not have to worry about the weight i subject them to   pros  1  the shelves are made of steel  you can sit on it and it will not bend  it bends flexes a_little if you stand on it  like any steel product  yes  i_tried it while it was partially assembled to_make sure i_do_not get any surprises at night  the sleeves did_not break either  the 4 vertical hollow posts or legs holding the shelves are also steel  equally sturdy  each vertical leg comes in two pieces and the joints go in tight  this_product is solidly built  so  great_value for money  now_i have 3 of these shelves  someone commented the plastic sleeves keep sliding down  but i_did_not have any problems   you just need_to be a_little careful in placing them  also  i assembled the shelves upside down  i e  with the  lip  side down so_i_can stack more and easily slide off the_boxes when needed  engineering wise  i_do_not see any problems either way you assemble it  2  legs have small plastic feet to keep it from scratching floors  will they crack and break  only time will tell  3  assembly was very_easy_and the instructions clear  the assembled product was_not wobbly  unstable  4  shelves can be easily located at every 1 inch distance  the 4 metal tubes at the end of each shelf jam into 4 black plastic sleeves that you see in the picture  relocating the shelves later was also easy  after using for an entire day  we decided to change the levels for better stacking  the sleeves and the shelves did_not jam up_and the change was easy_to_make  5  looks good_for a dorm room  bedroom  or a garage  cons  1  goes 3ft wide by 4 1 2 ft high  would have preferred at least 5 1 2 ft high  my best friend in terms of storage for the kitchen god  i_love this shelving unit  it s_not much to look at  but no wire anything_is much to look at  let s agree on that much  but this_unit is sturdy as can be at a price point that is unbelievable  to_buy something of this strength and capable of this weight would normally cost  300  in my experience  originally  i_purchased this last year because_i was so sick and tired of going out to the garage to_get my vitamix  or kitchenaid mixer  crockpot  etc  but my kitchen didn_t have enough cabinet space to house it all and i am 100  anti clutter on the countertops  nothing makes a kitchen look messier than lots of stuff on the countertop  no matter how nice the appliance  so  i looked for a temporary and cheap option on which i_can just put my appliances and call it a day  i gave no consideration to appearance because_it was going_to be put in a side sitting area  out_of clear view from the kitchen  so this amazonbasics shelving unit fit the bill in price_and utility  but once we put this together  which was easy    it proved to be such a huge plus and assistant in my kitchen life  from canister of various types of flour  sugar  etc  i filled the top rack and the second and third rack was used to my mixers  food processors and other items i pull out regularly to prevent my having to bend over to_get it   if you ve ever picked up a kitchenaid mixer  you d know how heavy that monster is   on the bottom rack  i put two large plastic tubs with covers to keep them closed  one was full of various spices and other ingredients that don_t require refrigeration but i_use infrequently enough that i_don_t need it in my cabinets  the_other was full of dog food  dog treats  dog stuff in general like the exorbitantly priced kong cheese whiz like things  and so forth  the two plastic containers kept it looking neat and organized  and the shelf had no_problems carrying all_of this stuff  and then i recently moved  as my movers were bringing stuff in  i_got to unpacking my kitchen like i always do first but as appliances emerged  i waited and waited for this damn shelf to be brought it  wouldn_t you know_it    someone stole the entire shelf from the loading area  granted  the_problem was most likely that of my movers who left it out there like trash  but this and a_few other items were stolen once they took it off the truck and left it on the curb  after i_decided not to kill them on the spot because they just weren t worth going_to jail for  i_got to ordering the shelf immediately  there was no looking at other shelves  i_wanted this shelf and i_wanted it now  while i_didn_t opt for next day delivery  i_did use my prime and before i knew it  the shelf was here  built and i could finally organize my kitchen  at my current place  much like my previous house  this shelving unit is in a adjacent room  in this case a storage and laundry room that i have  it s a perfect size for placement against one_of the walls and houses basically the_same things i had on it before  alongside another outdoor large shelving i had that i now use for pantry items  highly_recommend  oddly  the second shelf i_bought is less adjustable than the_first  i was trying_to put one shelf a_little higher than the_others and it wouldn_t lock in place as securely as my previous shelf had done  so this time  i kept it exactly_as shown with evenly spaced shelving  which wasn_t a big deal but it s something to keep in mind  it doesn_t take away from its function or utility in any way and i could not recommend it more  get this shelf  perfect_for my tiny kitchen art studio perfect_for my tiny kitchen art studio  just as pictured and easy_to put together  i_bought the plastic shelf sheets amazon suggested with this and they fit perfect  these shelves are the perfect item for our purpose and at a better price     these shelves are the perfect item for our purpose and at a better price than home depot  easy_to assemble with one person     great way to_add shelving  my closet had three shelves in it    very high shelves and for the most part  useless  so  i ripped them out and replaced them with this_unit  i had to  build  the shelves inside of the closet because they wouldn_t fit through the door after being constructed  it was very_easy_to put together and i_like that i could set the height for each shelf  i_needed space to put a large container under the bottom shelf and with this being adjustable  i was able_to_do that  i have doubled my closet space and love the_unit  it looks very classy and it also very sturdy  well_worth the_money  originally  i was going_to put wire rack shelving that attaches to the wall  but  after adding up the_cost for the 5 shelves  the mounting brackets that go on the wall  and the  arms  that hold up the shelf  it came to well over  100  this_unit was a much better idea overall  perfect_for outside organization   i_purchased this shelf to help organize my backyard  i really loved the final product  i_ll list the_other items below in case anyone would like to replicate this idea  the shelf has worked perfectly  we also attached the frame to the wall  absolutely mandatory with small kids   it comes_with hardware to attach  the outside was a chaotic mess and visually disturbing  i_used this shelf to organize and it s working perfect  here are the vinyl stickers  they are permanent and have held up amazing in our 1    degree weather  duro decal permanent adhesive vinyl letters   numbers  3  gothic black here are the buckets amazonbasics 5 shelf shelving unit   black the four buckets are weather proof  rust proof with locking kids  the lids were key  for me  because most ideas_i saw involved open containers  i_didn_t want water  leaves  dirt etc accumulating inside  the letters were  6 and these were the_hardest part actually  lining them up  finding the right spacing and figuring out what to include was tricky  the letters are permanent and designed to be used outside  i left room for more buckets   storage later as their toys and interest shift  the black color makes this shelf cool and also prevents any unintentional conduction of electricity this shelf is beautify and stable  the black color makes this shelf cool and also prevents any unintentional conduction of electricity  this shelf does_not include screws which are hard to implement and easy_to lose  you only need_to connect 2 parts together around the stick  the small parts are noted which side is top  and then put the board from top  so easy_and simple  and this design of implementation also ensures its stability  great space saver  so_far i_love it  i_wanted something to hold my bigger cooking appliances that were crowding my counters  this works_perfectly for my needs and my kitchen looks less cluttered  i will update later if needed  i_do have a second one_i plan to utilize in my garage  you will not regret this_purchase  love  love  love  i felt like my kitchen walls were caving in on me  my kitchen is laughably small to begin with  with no counter space to speak of  and almost no cabinet space    things would be  put away  and not a_few hours later the counters would be covered in random things from everyone_in the house and cooking or accomplishing anything_in the kitchen would be near impossible  while dreams of a wrecking crew coming through and demolishing and starting from scratch were lovely  they were just that  pipe dreams    we did what we could  bought one_of these and extended our counter with a commercial food prep table  oh the difference  i feel like i have a_new kitchen   this has added an immense amount of storage space and allowed me to store some of my space hogging but much needed things like my beloved kitchenaid mixer  dry goods  etc etc etc    it s sturdy  assembled like a breeze  i_did it by myself    and the_price was right  if you re on the fence  do yourself the favor  get it    i_m already contemplating purchasing more for other purposes around the house  great_product  five_stars fits my closet perfectly perfect  very_happy_with my purchase  my pantry was looking like a disaster with all my daughters snacks and water bottles all over the floor  the rack fits perfect in the pantry  not too wide or narrow  so_far the rack seems strong enough_to hold some of our snacks and 100 bottles of water  the shelf is big enough for me to have about 80 bottles stacked on one shelf  exactly what i_wanted  great_deal we live in a condo with no garage so storage space is the constant problem  i_wanted more shelves in the closet without spending  60  on shelving systems they have at home depot  this was perfect  very sturdy and functional  easy_set_up  gave much more space and still able_to hang coats in the closet  i shop on_amazon a_lot and this was one_of the_best purchases ive made easy assembly and sturdy design these shelves are great  i_use them in my storage room so_i_can get more in there  total time to put completely together was about 30 or so minutes with help from my wife  the biggest issue i had was figuring out where to put the clips  i_thought they didn_t fit because they wouldn_t clip together but there are slots on the poles that hold them together  that issue took a_few minutes to figure out so_it wasn_t a big deal  i personally felt like the construction of the_product is good  overall  easy_to assemble and a sturdy product  i recommend this to anyone looking_for shelves that aren t a ridiculous price  great_product shelving came nicely packed  there are very few pieces to it and assembling is obvious  there are 4 rods for lower part of the shelving and 4 rods for higher part of the shelving  they have to be screwed together and connector is metallic and very durable  there are also 4 wire shelves and you need 32 plastic half pieces to put all shelves into the place at the height of your choice  package includes 34 of these pieces to assure assembly even in the very unlikely case of you breaking up to 2 of them  printed assembly manual is included  but you hardly need it at_all  assembling process is very_easy  i would say 15 minutes for 1 person and under 5 minutes for 2 people with second person would keep shelf more or less horizontally while you secure each of the 4 sides of the shelf  being fully assembled  this shelving feels solid  looks great_and indeed saves lots of space  solid  strong alternative for a bookcase purchased this_unit along with the sterling brand shelf liners  which fit this_unit perfectly  and am extremely happy_with how this came out  i was looking_for more living room storage space for heavy books  games and other items  affordable bookcases all would sag under the weights i_wanted to place on the shelves and i_didn_t want_to pay  300  for a_good  solid wood bookcase  this_unit with the shelf liners looks amazing in the space and i_can pile loads of weight on each shelf with no fear of any sag  a_great affordable solution for my needs  i was able_to easily put it together by myself  2 people might make it a_little easier to start   i was easily able_to_make a_couple_of shelf height adjustments after the_unit was completed  again 2 people might make it_even easier   once up_and in place it feels very solid  i_like the leveling feet as my wood flooring is a_little uneven near the wall i was placing it on  i have since ordered the matching 4 shelf shelving unit to place next to this_one  great_deal for  45 00 this is a steal  i_bought service caster pre20634zn tpu 4 caster with 3 8  threaded stem  non marking polyurethane wheel  2  size  pack of 4  for it  so_it wold be easier to move around  as someone who works in a commercial kitchen  i was looking_for something to store bulkier items on  to free up counter space and make my small apartment kitchen more workable  and less annoying  liked it so_much that i_purchased a second unit  my food processor  toaster oven  heavier pans  sous vide equipment  bulk rice containers  immersion blender  etc  have found a_new home  also all my cookbooks reside on these shelves  along with other books which were formerly stacked in piles on the floor in front of a bookshelf  it is so_inexpensive that i_m even toying with the idea of getting a third one  possibly just to be able_to_add an extra shelf to each of the_ones i already have  highly_recommend this item  especially for apartment dwellers who might move frequently  as this type of shelving is very sturdy  modular  adaptable  and compact when disassembled  this shelving unit is very sturdy and is holding up excellently with a_lot of     this shelving unit is very sturdy and is holding up excellently with a_lot of stuff on it  this shelving unit was a_little tricky to put together and itll be easier for you to put together if you read this review  theres a_couple_of things you need_to know  1  the bag of black plastic interlocking pieces needed both pointed to the top and then you put them on the shelving unit near the double ridge lines on the poles and if you move them up or down  depending on where you put the two interlocking pieces  youll hear them snap in place with a clicking sound and you wont be able_to easily move them up or down without taking the two pieces apart  2  this is a_lot easier to put together with two people  that said  i put it together alone and it wasnt too bad  3  there is a right way and a wrong way to put the shelves onto the black interlocking pieces  if they dont seem to fit in easily  you put it on the wrong way  theres really no other way to tell than that as far as_im aware  this is a_great shelving unit thats worth the_money if you want shelves to put stuff on  turned my coat closet into a pantry my apartment didnt come_with a pantry and i_need one so_i_bought this_unit assembled it myself took 30 minutes  turned my coat closet into a pantry  this was extremely easy_to put together this was extremely easy_to put together  i was worried that it would be confusing based on earlier reviews  i_did watch the youtube video before opening the package  looked easy  and it was  i think amazon read the earlier reviews about the shelf stops being difficult to figure out which way the go  because_it looks_like they improved the_product  not_sure if the earlier product had this  but my unit s shelf stop clips had an arrow that pointed up on both sides so_i knew exactly how to position the clips  i_did_notice the arrow on the clips in the video as_well  i knew i_needed more_than one unit but was hesitant to_buy more based on some of the reviews  now that i_know how simple the_unit is to assemble  i will be buying another_one  great little shelving this is exactly what i_needed  was a_bit tricky putting it together and i have many spare parts left over   however it seems very sturdy  i struggled for awhile until i_went and looked at other people s reviews and comments and one person said to put it together upside down  and that was the most helpful   it went together like a piece of cake then  was easy  have no idea where that saying came from  i have one extra sleeve packaged separately and 8 cap like things i never used   not_sure where they were supposed to_go  since the sleeves didn_t totally fit tight snapping together i put a small piece of monster tape to keep them together   prob due to arthritic hands  still mystified by the caps though as everything_is covered and sturdy  when putting together seemed wobbly at times  but once_it was standing upright it was tight and firm as could be  so_i give this 5_stars   definitely worth the low price   d even an ole gal like myself can do it   73   d this is a bargain wow  what a bargain  this is actually a seville shelving unit sold under the amazonbasics name  i have four huge shelving units in my basement for storage and i_bought this small guy to put between my stove and sink  here s the deal  i have read all the_one_star reviews and i_can_tell you that those reviews are written by people who either didn_t read the assembly instructions or who just don_t know how to follow them  same goes for the 4 huge seville shelving units i now have in my basement  all four are great  again  i_can see how people can complain that parts don_t fit all because they were too lazy to read the instructions  this is one great shelving unit at a_very low price  buy it and make sure you have the plastic parts snapped into the grooves and right side up_and you are in business i was a_bit worried because_i usually pay more for the_units but these are really nice  i_m 70 and only 5 feet tall my unit arrived today and i put it together soon after  i already  had eight others similar ones  so_i_m quite experience doing so  this actually feel quite strong  i was a_bit worried because_i usually pay more for the_units but these are really nice  i_m 70 and only 5 feet tall  so anyone can do it  the_others that i already had are a different brand  but i_m guessing the_same people make them  because the parts are almost identical  i have had some for a decade  easy_to assemble my five year_old even helped fits perfectly in the garage  easy_to assemble my five year_old even helped  sturdy with multiple uses  i_m commenting on the chrome 3 shelf unit   sturdy  quick to assemble if you do it correctly  enclosed instructions too small to read    thus  take heed   you must assemble these shelves with the  lip  side down   i_tried assembly w  lip side up  but that did_not_work   the lip  side  must be down  and the little plastic  anchors  must face up  see the arrow on the plastic anchor   the arrows on each half of the plastic anchors must be pointed up    the lip i_m referring to_runs around all 4 sides of each shelf   i_might not be very clear with this  but when you see the shelves  it should be apparent as to what you need_to_do  someone posted a_couple_of video clips on this listing that will be more helpful  so  the chrome    20 00 is a_great_buy  i would definitely purchased this item again  take care  best shelving for quality and price this is an_excellent buy  in fact it is the second one_i_purchased  i would call this a medium weight shelving unit  others costing double are really heavy duty and suitable really for industrial or professional use  this weight is perfect_for home use and can really hold a_lot of weight  the size  circumference  of the legs is the_same as the heavy weight professional units so you can mix and match  i_bought the 54  one and each leg comes as 2 pieces that screw together  in other words 8 pieces for the 4 legs so_if you ever decide you want a shorter unit it is easily converted  simple to put together  excellent value  it s great  i_love it it s great  i_love it  i have a ton of kitchen appliances in a tiny apartment and this has given me so_much more room  it s sturdy and the feet are adjustable so you can make it level on an uneven floor  or even tip it back toward the wall a_little  the black sleeves that hold the shelves up are all slightly different sizes so some of the shelves aren t perfectly straight  and i wish that there were a counter height version of this shelf  last i looked there was this tiny one  then one that s like six feet tall  i_wanted a four shelf unit to hold everything_i_do with this_one  plus my microwave on top  but still  love this  it s a_great_deal and really useful  i_can_t believe it can hold so_much weight  very awesome shelf unit we have purchased the larger size of this similar shelf unit from costco in 2007  wife was looking_for something smaller to put not often used kitchen items and found this_unit  she assembled it together without issues  the main issue she came across was_not putting the shelves at the right height to leave enough space for the items and had to adjust them afterwards  amazonbasics 5 shelf shelving unit is good looking  super strong  and is a_great_value   i highly_recommend it   the amazonbasics 5 shelf shelving unit is extremely well built  can handle most of anyone s weigh capacity needs  decorative shelf trim doubles as additional lateral support  only drawback  get some help  holding items  when assembling  i consider myself as a coordinated person     i ended up putting it on its side during assembly     worked out fine  after using a tape measure to adjust each shelf  i set the_unit upright and started at the bottom   up     using a medium rubber hammer  over a board  to tap each corner of the shelves     locking them into the well designed shelf supports  they can support a_lot of weight  continue tapping each shelf   support until you reach the top one  once all are locked in     this_unit is super sturdy  can go back to adjust   change heights any time     very  very_easy  i highly_recommend this amazonbasics wall shelving unit  excellent aesthetics  and super value  4 shelf shelving unit in black purchased this shelving unit in black to hold outdoor potted plants like rosemary and other herbs inside the house over the winter  adjusted some of the shelves to accommodate the different heights of the plants  placed on each of the shelves  instead_of using individual pot saucers  inexpensive black long plastic trays meant for shoes that are wet or muddy from the outdoors to catch any drips after watering the plants  shelving was easy_to put together  is sturdy  plus looks great_and with no scratches or damage from shipping  i was thrilled about that  next spring when i_can_take the plants back outside  i plan on using the shelving in the pantry room for short term storage items until the next time_i bring the plants inside  i_like this shelving so_much that i_might have to purchase another  great shelving and easy_to assemble great shelving units  strong  stable  they go together very easily once you catch on  the instructions themselves are barely helpful  as usual  no mention  for example  of the fact that the plastic grommets in the legs are only there for shipping purposes and should be thrown away  the little plastic pieces  which come in sealed bags  that hold the shelving in position on the legs only go together one way and  click  into place  you just have to pay attention to which end is up  as_i said  once you catch on  the_units go up easily and quickly   great_product  very  very  very hard instructions to follow  be prepared  have a soft drink or something before hand  well  this_product  after its been put together  is pretty_good  there is a real problem with putting this bad boy together  the_first 30 minutes i was so pissed at the_seller  amazon basic  that i had to stop myself from writing this review with 1 star  there are 3 or 4 problems_with putting this together  one  the instruction manual is just a_little smaller than a playing card  yes   with such small print  it s hard to follow  if you look at the pictures on the_product page  you ll see two clips that hold the shelves in place on each pole  this is the real head ache  make sure you put the shelf on with the flat side up  then the shelf fits over the two halves but not all the_way  it catches  so  especially the bottom  you have to_make sure that_all the clips around the poles are on the_same distance so that the shelf is even  do this and you ve got it licked  i_can_t help but wonder why someone associated with this_product does_not make a quick web video showing how to put this together  this  if not making this shelf more user friendly  would at least make amazonbasic come across better  one_of the_best priced and built wire shelving units out there  for those needing a simple and sturdy wire shelf  this amazonbasics 4 shelf unit is one_of the_best product out there for its class  i would highly_recommend this to anyone need such a simple shelf without the hassle  i_bought this shelf to put inside my closet that lacked a shelving system  compared to many of the_other brands out on_amazon and other major stores  this shelf is one_of the most affordable  possibly the cheapest when i_bought it  units of its size  to simply break it down  pros   possibly the cheapest product for its size and offering compared to other brands and stores  very sturdy   specs say it s rated at 350lbs per shelf loaded evenly   i_ve filled mine with textbooks and other heavy stuff with no_issues  shelves are height adjustable with simple  sturdy plastic clips that can be positioned however you like  the bottom of the whole shelving unit has adjustable legs in case you have uneven flooring  very_easy_to assemble   possible to_do it with only one person   the_unit itself is light weight   can move around with one person   as with any brand type of shelf  do store the heaviest biggest items on the bottom shelf first cons   unless i_m not a_very picky person  i_can_t find any cons to this_product  other considerations   my packaging looked like it was handled roughly during transit  but since the item itself was sturdy  there were no_issues  this concerns is primarily focused at the shippers  not amazon itself  your experience with the packaging may vary  this is an_excellent  solid   sturdy shelf took me a_few tried_to figure out how all the pieces fit together even with the guide  but the end result was definitely worth the effort  this is an_excellent  solid   sturdy shelf  it holds an incredible amount of weight and looks wonderful in our kitchen  i am going_to order a_new_one because of how crowded our kitchen counters and cabinets has gotten  don_t believe the few bad reviews you may have read  most of them are from people who can_t read instructions or didn_t try very hard to figure out the few parts that may require some more detailed instructions  easy assembly and great_price with prime shipping these shelves are great_and easy_to put together if you follow the instructions  one thing_i_did differently from the instructions was that i turned it upside down to_get the_first shelf on  setting the shelf on my lap upside down and just inserting each pole  then i flipped it over and finished it  when it arrived  a_few of the plastic protection rings were destroyed  they get thrown away anyway  so no big deal  however  at least one_of the shelves was very slightly deformed upon arrival  it was barely noticeable and wouldn_t affect anything  though  this was my first amazon basics purchase and i_m pretty happy_with it  i_d give it 4 75_stars if possible  but i_ll round up  now_if_i could just buy one more shelf piece with the connectors to_add to this  it would be perfect  clever design  and rock solid a_very solid nice shelf unit for wherever you need one  not flimsy like many are  the instructions are minimal and if you are not intuitive and have experience assembling things  you should ask a friend over   who is  to help  it helps to study it and understand why it is built they way it is  that is  the parts themselves  the design is intelligent and modern  and does work quite well  i_like mine a_lot  i would recommend it to anyone  just be sure you have the right person assemble  it might be very frustrating for some  but  many great things are  i could build a second one_in 15 20 minutes  now that i understand the design  i highly_recommend it  the_price_is great  excellent quality as_well  amazing shelf for the_price  great quality shelf  works for my needs in the garage  will be picking up more  there are plastic stand offs of some kind that sit i think on each of the circle corners during shipping  those were busted apart upon arrival and i_thought they were needed  but they are only for shipping and say in the instructions to discard them  other then that  they include 2 extra plastic inserts as spares  nice looking sturdy shelf for the_price  will definitely buy_again  one_of the_best products i have ever bought this is by far  one_of the_best products i have ever bought  its amazingly strong  i was able_to bring it in my house  set it up all by myself  i_bought the shelf liners which i recommend  i have this set_up along one_of the walls in my kitchen and is holding  my pressure cooker  my crock pot  my blenders and lovely white accent boxes  it has brought organization to my kitchen because_i have nothing on my counters any more  very_pleased  happy in ny  worth it i was able_to put it together by myself  was_not hard  it s very stable  holds all the pots and pans  look nice  sturdy  easy assemble i_needed some shelves to hold kitchen appliances  as_i have a shortage of cabinet space  i plan to build more cabinets so_i_didn_t want_to plunk too much money down on shelves that would be upgraded in a_few years  i_wanted them to look nice_and be sturdy  these shelves fit the bill  they hold a heavy standing mixer and a heavy pressure cooker in addition to a variety of other odds and ends  you can adjust the heights pretty easily  so my smaller appliances don_t have to_take up as much vertical space  they look nice  even nice enough for a modern kitchen setup   not the style i_ll have  unfortunately for the shelves   my kids have bonked into them a_couple times without toppling them over  assembly was easy  and spare parts were included just in case  i could see these eventually going in the pantry to hold cans or jars of pickles  or perhaps in the workshop to help organize tools or something  highly_recommended i_bought two of these for my garage to store things as_i have no room in my apartment  my brother was here the day we put them together and now the word is spreading  he wants some too  i was surprised by the sturdiness and quality of this item  i_expected something that wiggled and didn_t hold anything  not the_case  this is fantastic  i waited till they came back in stock and ordered another_one for my garage  it should be here today  please keep in mind  i_m only stockpiling on toilet paper and other light products  instructions were less_than helpful  great_product    it took me a minute to figure out the instructions  but once_i_got the hang of it it was super easy_to put together  15 min tops  the key is that the lip has to be facing down otherwise it wont work  the clips dont snap in place together  but thats part of how the shelves stay up  honestly the instructions made it way more confusing than necessary  very sturdy  pretty lightweight  adjustable  a  a basic necessity  easy_to put together  this was a snap to put together  it s incredibly sturdy  and actually looks fairly decent  my roommate and i had it unpacked and assembled in about 10 minutes  and it could be done by one person easily too   i_m using it in my entryway as an annex to pantry items and bulk goods like paper towels  i_made the bottom shelf tall enough_to accommodate a bin for recycling  the_one thing to note  as_i learned from another reviewer is to_make sure you re installing the shelves with the lip down    otherwise  the shelves won_t catch properly on the little snaps on the poles  the lip isn_t a lip to prevent things from falling off your shelves  it s decorative  and if you try to_install with the lip up  you ll have trouble  great shelves  great_price  easy_to construct and adjust  i_ve now put 5 of these together  they re strong  sturdy  and easy_to construct  they have adjustable feet so they re easy_to stabilize  they offer plenty_of storage on the shelves  and below the bottom shelf too   i also hang tools underneath the edges to increase my storage space  i_don_t know how much weight they ll support  but i_can_tell you i keep a_lot of stuff on them and they re perfectly stable  i_do keep the heavy things on the bottom and the lighter things on top  but i_ve never been worried about a collapse or a topple  worth every penny great quality and my husband said it was easy_to put together  it really cleaned up our closet  great_product and a_good bargain  its sturdy and didn_t take too much time to_setup i_bought this to organize and clear up space in my garage  its sturdy and didn_t take too much time to_setup  no more clutter around the garage  i_d buy more of these for organization  didn_t get to keep it for myself the least thing_i_liked about it  was_it wasn_t easy_to put together with just me doing it  the_hardest part was holding the shelves up while getting them on the frame  the clamp kept on popping off until i could get the shelves slid down on them  the_other thing was making sure they were even as you had to count the marks on the frame itself to_make sure both sides of the shelf were at the_same height  the bad thing about it was  i_didn_t get to keep the shelf after i had put it together  my wife took one look at it and decided she had to have it for her crafting room  lol  have to admit  it does look good there even though i will now have to order another for me  overall i am happy_with buying it and will definitely order another_one for me now  this is a sturdy rack and holds food this is a sturdy rack and holds food  blenders  and even a cast iron wok  as long as you put it together correctly  you will have no_problems  my husband walked up_and started to help me put it together and just put the clamps on with out looking a the directions and put them on upside down  he was_irritated right off the bat when they flew off when trying_to put the shelf down secure  once he turned them around  no_problems  
good_product at good_price  but qc problem good_product  easily assembled  but had a grumpifying qc failure  one_of the post joiners was misthreaded  but had been driven firmly home  such that there was a six degree bend in the middle of the post when assembled  it took a soft jawed vise  a soft jawed vise grip and a breaker bar to_get the joiner out  fortunately  the threads    though damaged    were not destroyed  and i was able_to insert the joiner manually with the threads properly aligned   if someone without a well equipped workshop had gotten this  s he would not have been able_to assemble it  once the defect was remedied  it went together easily  and seemed entirely the equal of more expensive units of like design  i found myself wishing there were a wider size range available  i_like it well enough that i would buy it again  an incidental advantage is the_one_inch diameter of the posts  it made it easy_to fashion leg extenders for the rear legs to accommodate a 3 inch step down in the floor   1  id thick walled pvc pipe  1  hardwood dowel  3 8  threaded inserts  see photo  sturdy  good_value  useless instructions the shelves are sturdy and a_good_value  the assembly instructions are useless  don_t waste your time  if you google wire shelving rack assembly  you will find a_video showing exactly how to put these together  the video is for a different brand  but it is exactly the_same  the little clips that hold the shelves in place are a_little funky  they don_t tell you this  but if you look inside you will see a tiny little ridge  when you put the clips on the support poles  you want_to position them just above the groove where you want them  if you slide them down and you will hear a click when they hit the groove  alternatively  you can leave them just above  and when you put the shelf on you can push the shelf down and it will keep going down until the clips hit the groove  after doing more several  i found the_first way gave me better results  the_first shelving unit took a long time to assemble  mostly because_i was trying_to read the useless instruction book  after watching the video  the next one took 20 minutes  so pretty     it s so affordable for me to_use this at my college  however  the two parts that connects and is suppose to stay moved very easily while i was placing the shelves  it made the process just quite harder for someone that is making it by themselves  however super efficient  and perfect with organizing baskets with a_little extra effort  this is a_good  sturdy shelving unit i_don_t want_to be too hasty in writing this review  i just got this today  so_if anything goes horribly wrong  i_ll just   amend it by reviewing the_other two of this same unit that i just ordered  a_little background  i_purchased this_unit as a test to_see if_it would be a_good replacement for some seriously sagging bookcases that i_bought last year to hold my extensive liquor collection  after checking out the specs and then the reviews  i_thought  what the heck   it shipped and arrived fast  i_like that  i also like that this_unit was easy_to put together  i read and followed the instructions carefully and had no trouble putting it together in about 15 minutes  there are a_few gripes from negative reviews that i would like to_address with this review  yes  one_of the shelves was slightly bent on arrival  i took a mallet and straightened it out  problem solved  yes  the little plastic collars that hold the shelves in place are fluted and they have a top and a bottom  install them correctly and you shouldn t have any trouble  the shelves have a top and a bottom too  same thing  is it a tad wobbly when it s finally assembled  sure  so anchor it to the wall  i actually grabbed a 50 metal bracket from the store because_i wasn_t super impressed with the anchoring device it came_with and my workaround works_great  i also put some of those furniture slider disks under the legs  worked_great_for getting it into final position  now the_best part  it s sturdy when properly assembled and anchored  i believe it can and will hold the weight it claims to  i have this first one loaded down with rum and it s standing straight and true  oh yeah  the space between the wires on each shelf is significant  so get the shelf liners if you re going_to be using this for things like bottles  i_ordered some and am making do with cardboard  just cut up the_box it came_in  until they get here  overall  i_like this_unit  is it super attractive  no  is it perfect as packaged  no  is it a_good_value  yes  do i recommend it for simple  easy_to assemble shelving needs  yes  the importance of part e and the shelves original review i originally gave this_product a 1  here s what i said  as other people who gave this_product a single star  it s the pieces that the shelves rest on  part e in the list of parts  do_not fit well around the vertical poles  hence  the shelves are not securely supported  while the rest of the_product are very_well constructed and made of metal  these parts are made of cheap plastic  not really up to the_quality of the rest of the shelving  updated review went back and read the reviews of people who gave this a  1   i noticed that many seemed to have an issue with part e not connecting completely and then not holding the shelves tightly enough  as_i looked at the unstable shelving i had just put together i noticed that the round parts at the four corners of each shelf are larger on one side than the_other  then it hit me   if_i turned the shelves over  the larger part of the end circles would fit down over part e  keeping part e tight  i had originally put the shelves on so that the lip running around all four edges of the shelves were facing up  i_thought to keep things from falling off the shelves   when i turned the shelves over and put it back together it becomes sturdy  because of what i_mentioned above  and solid   able_to hold the amount of weight listed in the_product description  i_went from a  1  rating to a  4      i would have given it a  5  but the manufacturer needs to modify the directions explaining the relationship between part e and the shelves  good  clear  well thought out directions can save a company a_lot of money  if the directions are clear  support costs decrease and customer satisfaction and loyalty increase  ok shelving units  quality could be better but they ll work this is an  ok  shelving unit  i have several of the  hdx  brand ones from hd  the orange store  from years ago  which like all_of these are knockoffs of the real  metro  shelving units  i even have some metro brand shelves on my hdx brand units  they re almost identical  i_thought  hoped   these shelves were interchangeable  as at  25 each extra shelf it s cheaper to_buy 2 full 5 shelf kits and throw away the poles from one to_get more shelves  also as hd didn_t have units this tall  i planned to_take the shelves from my existing hdx ones and use them on these   turns out you can_t   these amazonbasics shelves are 34 11 16  between poles  while metro   others are 34 3 8   you just can_t install both on one set of poles without bending the poles  in the end  i_bought 2 kits  i_used all 10 amazonbasics shelves on one unit  and 10 hdx   metro shelves on the_other unit s poles  that s_not what most people are going_to_do  so_i_m not knocking it for that reason  the unfortunate part is the_quality just isn_t as_good as even the hd ones for about the_same price  i_ve had the hd ones for years   taken apart  moved with me  reassembled multiple times  barely a scratch on the poles  almost all_of the amazon poles were scratched just during assembly of the shelves   most likely painted rather than powdercoated  then the grooves on the poles aren t as deep or well defined as the_other brands  or maybe full of paint    and the plastic clips have only 1 groove bump vs  2 on the_other units  to catch 2 grooves on the pole for more support   so the clips tend to slide down the poles when pounding the shelves on   pound the shelf off  try again  repeat   on one the clip stuck to the shelf hole when it slipped and i had to pound it all the_way up the pole past all the_other grooves to_get it out_of the shelf   i found installing a bar clamp squeezed around the pole just under each clip while installing the shelves keeps them in place long enough for them to wedge in tight  once tightly wedged  they seem to hold fine  next the wire gauge is thinner than the_other brands  so they don_t support as much weight before bending  if you don_t have  or haven_t seen   used other brands  especially the real metro ones  and can compare them  you probably won_t know the difference so long as you don_t get one that s overly difficult to_get the clips to stay  just be 100  sure the clips are holding before putting too much weight on them  don_t overload them and you ll be ok  read this for instruction help so this shelf is actually pretty terrific  had a_bit of a difficult time setting up mostly because the instruction booklet is really small and hard to_see  nor does it seem to be drawn to scale  take a quick glance over the instructions before reading this to_get the context and an idea of what you re supposed to_do and if you can_t figure it out or get stuck  read this  put those little screw in hooves in the poles of the lower legs  after prepping the lower four legs  start by applying the clasps around the second square from the  hoof  of the bottom poles  stick it in the middle of the square and then nudge it upward with your thumb and you should hear feel it snap in place  apply the second clasp directly opposite of the_first clasp  keep in mind that they aren t supposed to close on both sides physically impossible   you d think they should and it seems like a_lot of people returned their shelves because they thought they were supposed to  but they work just_fine without doing so  once you apply the clasps around every leg  you can put the_first shelf on  the next main problem is that it doesn_t tell you how far apart the shelves should be placed for maximum space on each shelf  i_didn_t use measuring tape or anything but i started on the second square from the bottom and placed a shelf on every 17th square after that initial second square  the final shelf should be on the last square before upper  hoof   i recommend marking those 17th squares with tape or rubber bands so you don_t lose your place as you put them on because_it gets harder to count see the squares when the shelves are on top of them  great  sturdy shelf  slightly annoying to put together  you definitely need two people to put this together in the beginning if not the whole way to help keep it sturdy during the process  the little clips that you put on to help the shelf stay in place are very annoying in that they don_t stay in place very_well as you are putting the shelf on  many times they fell off as we were setting the shelf on so we had to scramble to_get it off the floor and put back together on the rod  with that said  this is a_very sturdy shelving unit once you get it put together and we did flip a_couple_of the shelves upside down to create that lip for particular items being stored on the shelf  i had to give it a 4 star solely on the fact that it was a slight pain to_get together with the little clips and that we had to_use a rubber mallet to_get the shelves even  as they don_t go over the clips evenly  will probably order another_one like this because of how sturdy it is  but not looking_forward to assembly process  sturdy enough for price we put 2 of these in our son s bedroom  he has a camo superhero room  subsequently  we had to create everything from scratch  so  his room is silver and camo green  along with superhero accents  pros  sturdy for toy boxes  3 boxes per shelf   if you buy the liners you can use them as shelves to_set things on  clock  piggy bank  etc   nice chrome   no damage  easy enough_to assemble  neg  the assembly is a_bit odd  not_sure why the black locks don_t actually connect_together  but once you realize that info  it s okay  we bought a second one to match the_first  great shelving unit  i_love this shelving unit  it was easy_to put it together by myself  as_i was_impatient and didn_t want_to wait for hubby to help put it together  the_only complaint i have is the clips if they re not clipped properly  they will fly off  usually as you re trying_to put a shelf on them   as_i had said  i also put them together on my own  and didn_t bother with the instructions   as_i was_impatient and figured i_didn_t need them  lol  so  in my haste  i accidentally started putting it together incorrectly  and was using some of the top poles as bottom poles  so_i_can_testify that it does come apart easily  i had already put three shelves on the poles before i realized my error   i_bought this to organize my fabrics  as_i_like to sew and keep all my leftover scraps for future projects  so_i_can_t truly judge how well it handles weight  but it is very sturdy  i_can now easily see all the fabric i have and can get it for any sewing project that i want_to_make  
arrived damaged the shelves are sturdy and easy_to put together   very_pleased_with the_unit  however  one_of the shelves arrived significantly bent  disappointed to receive a damaged product  good i_ve bought and used a shelving unit  pretty much exactly like this_one  but from walmart  and i think that one_is slightly better quality  this shelf is fine  does the job  holds what i_need it to hold  but i could only fit 3 of the 4 shelves if you wanted narrow shelves then i_guess you could fit the 4th one on  but i_don_t feel like that d give you enough space for any  at least wouldn_t give me enough space for what i am using the shelves for  the_one_i_got from walmart was taller and seemed a_little sturdier  not that amazon s is weak  easy_to assemble  stays together and easy_to_take apart  tip  twist the poles to disconnect them from the shelves  a_lot easier than trying_to push pull the shelf off   the sum total value is greater than each individual part  decent value shelf definitely holds many items with its 5 shelves however assembling this_product is an issue  it uses a plastic jacket part that you must squeeze together and slide down each shelves rod these jackets do_not close completely however much i pressed  i even had to_use a hammer to_get the shelves even  it really was a struggle to assemble these shelves with this jacket mechanism  the end product is worth the struggle but i would give this 1 star if_it was based solely on the parts   still a_good_value sturdy and worth the_money spent sturdy and worth the_money spent  packaging from manufacturer could be a_lot better  tops of leg posts  plastic tops broken off because_it was only secured in box with a small cardboard wrap and zip tied to one_of the shelves  which was_not intacted upon receiving  love the leveling feet there are two major things to note with these shelves  the_first is that step 4 is_not correct in the instructions  the instructions have an entire set of parts missing from the list manual  instead_of screwing the poles into each other in step 4  you re meant to screw these male to male adapters into each end of the poles  d oh  i had set aside the adapters and  since_i was following the instructions  though amazon had screwed up in manufacturing the_product  minus one_star here  the second thing to note is that you have to_set the plastic pieces on the poles very particularly  there s a small line on the inside of the plastic that sits into the grooves on the poles   that s why some people find that the plastic pieces pop off  you have to_set each side into these grooves and push them together tightly  they don_t meet up on both sides for me  but the weight of the shelves will keep them in place  until the plastic degrades    minus one_star for this   i have it set_up in my pantry  which is a big closet without enough shelves   and the top it not all the_way at the top  but it still seems plenty stable  love the leveling feet  which allowed me to adjust it to be perfectly stable against the wall  if you re storing things like sauce liquor bottles  you ll likely need a shelf mat  though  i_ll probably update this in the future   i plan on moving next year and will be taking it with us  so_i_ll update on how well it makes it in a move  if nothing else     damaged goods  feels good though  nice looking shelf  feels pretty sturdy  until i was_installing the last shelf  i believe it was damaged by shipping and since_it is an amazon product  i feel that this should be part of the review  despite only one shelf being damaged  the_unit stands tall and feels sturdy  time will tell  shelf good   packaging sucks   the shelf itself is a_good  sturdy shelf that will hold lots of stuff  my problem is with the packaging and instructions  there were at least two dozen pieces of plastic parts in the_box  i was stressed out trying_to figure out where all these parts went  after a_lot of studying and a call to amazon  i found out that the mfr calls these extra pieces  packing material  and they aren t used when assembling the shelf  what a load  it appears that these pieces are the trash left over after the pieces are molded and pressed  i just don_t understand why they include the trash with the shelf when you purchase it  c mon_amazon  what s up with your quality control   very confusing  good_product  terrible instructions booklet it looks sturdy and serves its intended purpose  as_described  assembling it took me quite a while longer than_i suspect others would require  if you are a senior citizen and or a customer with poor vision  beware  the instructions for assembly come in a multilanguage booklet 3 50 x 4 25 inches  fleas are easier to_see than the print on those pages  i had to scan its pages  then expand the jpegs and print them to_see what the pages said  that is extremely frustrating  especially considering that a folding sheet would have allowed for instructions in all languages and still provided a clearer view of directions  i would only buy it again because  after assembling the second unit  i pretty much can do without the lilliputian print  frustrating   missing piece  the package that this_thing arrived_in was extremely beaten up_and heavily taped over  it looked like it could possibly have been a return  when i opened it up  most of the pieces were floating around loose in the_box  the pamphlet was stained  upon opening the pamphlet  the instructions were exceedingly poor  but i ultimately figured it out  as_i was nearing completion of construction  i found that one_of the clip pairs was missing  which meant that i could effectively use only 4 out_of the 5 shelves  i_can_t find replacements anywhere  and i_don_t want_to_go through the hassle of returning this item  frustrating  other_than these issues  the structure is basically sturdy and functional  if_it would have arrived with all_of the required pieces and without the packaging having been opened before  i_d say this is a 4 5 star item  
disappointed  i was definitely disappointed by the_quality of this_product  this is the_first time_i have received an amazon basics product that i_don_t feel is great quality  first  the_box showed up in pieces  there was a literal trail of small pieces of the rack  including the instructional book  from the delivery truck to my door  when i opened the_box shards of excess plastic pieces fell all over the place  thankfully  it seems those were just all junk extras  the actual metal rack was also pretty banged up in the shipping process  there is some marred pieces of shelf in the form of bent metal and missing paint  this ended up being a two person assembly project  the instructional booklet  which i almost needed to invite a mouse with bifocals over to read for me  was unclear  it would have been nice also_if there was some sort of indication of where to place the racks to evenly space them out instead_of having to count and divide or just do guess work  in the end  i_got the shelf up  it fits the space i_need  but i_don_t have a_lot of faith in it  the bottom legs seem to be pointed inward as_well instead_of straight  i_m not impressed  disappointed in this amazon product  inconsistent product   shipped undeliverable from amazon the_quality is acceptable for the_price but not as_good as other wire shelving i have purchased in the past mainly because of the strength and number of the cross wires on the shelves themselves  still it serves the purpose  heres my two issues  1  amazon uses the_same product name   description   part number even though they changed what is in the_box within the last year  i_bought one to match up to another i have and the pole height and grip marks do_not match the_product from a year ago  you cant math shelf height placement and the new_one_is about 1 5 taller  so_it just looks odd sitting next to the_other one  2  they shipped it usps and its overweight so the mail carrier wouldnt deliver it  i had to drive to the post office during their business hours and bring a_little card_and my license for them to dig it out so_i could take it home and build it  it would have been more convenient to just buy another product that doesnt match what i already have at a local retailer   at least the hours to pick it up would have been better_than usps  two_stars good_price to_buy  but my order just missing pieces  and the_product is sold by amazon poor quality recommend a different brand bought these because they looked exactly like other shelves we had purchased from home depot  they are not the_same or equivalent  while the design appears to be the_same  the_quality of these shelves is terrible  we purchased 4 units and almost all pieces  poles and shelves  were warped or bent in some way  it was sort of ridiculous  we love amazon and did_not expect this  we were able_to_make them work for the most part  one shelf was completely unusable but it would be such a hassle to_return so we just have one unit with 3 shelves instead_of 4  definitely dont recommend these  buy a different brand  
ridges in the plastic sleeves rub grind off easily  i_ve used metal shelves like this from other brands such as alera  whitmor  seville and they all work great  and basically in the exact same way   when i saw these metal shelves by amazonbasics at a cheaper price_and with such great reviews  i figured it was worth a shot  dude   these suck  with just a_little pressure  shelf just slides down the pole  after checking everything and taking it apart i saw that the plastic ridges in the sleeves had totally rubbed off  so_i_got another pair  and again  with the slightest pressure  the shelf just slid down  the_same thing happened  the ridges in the plastic sleeves had totally rubbed off  this happened on 4 sets of the plastic sleeves  i_m guessing they used some cheap  less durable plastic  if you look at the 2nd picture  you can see that the plastic ridges that are supposed to catch onto the metal pole are basically gone  there s no way these would support 250 pounds per shelf  maybe i just got a dud batch of plastic sleeves  cheaply made    bad product    frustrating customer_service     the_product is poorly made  and poorly packaged  the welds are thin and hastily done  the wires are set so_far apart you have to put a liner on them to keep things from falling through  i_m sure it cannot hold the claimed weight  i_ordered several units  there was obvious damage to most due to thin insufficient packaging  only one shelf was damaged beyond useability  i sent a complaint asking for a single shelf to be sent to complete the_unit  they sent a whole shelving unit and charged my card yet again  if_i could have viewed the item in person i would have never purchased such crap  it would be easier to_take these whole to the dump than to break them down to_return them  i recommend not_buying these  several shelves arrived bent it s nice_and cheap but also cheaply constructed  several of the shelves and beams were bent on arrival  they don_t hold a_lot of weight without sagging either  i would not purchase this again  wish i could give this more stars    too bad i_can_t return this or get a refund  poor design  i_got a real one at the     the plastic brackets that are supposed to hold up the shelves do_not fit   poor design  i_got a real one at the container store  one piece  foldable  is there no quality control at amazon    just sell anything  this item would be great if the clasps fit this item would be great if the clasps fit  they are way too small to fit around these poles  this shelf is useless without the clasps and i_cant build it  buy something else  i_bought it because_it s supposed to be a heavy duty shelf for my garage  but the little cheap plastic pieces that hold up the shelves don_t_even fit together properly  theres no way this will hold anything heavy  warning new version is made very cheep    amazon went cheep  i_purchased one_of these shelves in june 2017  that one_is great  bought another_one  nov 2017  and it s terrible    super cheep feet  one_of the top plugs is smashed  the screw in adjustment feet on the bottom are cheep plastic  one shelf is warped so almost impossible to assemble  and the list goes on  seriously  seems amazon changed vendors to supply these shelves so now the construction and quality control is very poor  not so great  1st order  i_bought two for my garrage  they look exactly how i_expected  very sturdy  easy_to assemble  good_value of money  2nd order  so_i_liked my first pair so ordered second one  one_of two was losely packed and had some scratches  the stands are not sturdy and legs are not aligning  shelves looks bent too  very_disappointed with this_product some of the parts don_t screw well together  one foot screw was too thick for the all bottom poles  i had to remove all the foot screw so they ll be level  the plastic sleeves do_not connect around the pole either  very_disappointed with this_product  i should have just gone to target and bought a similar product  also  it s too much a hassle to_return so to the trash it goes  they do_not send you the item in photo  they use stock photos and do_not send you the actual item in the photo   also the description says the rack is 36 wide  it is only 33   this shelf is very small  i was expecting something much larger based on the review photos  i really feel scammed right now  not worth the_money  i wasn_t very impressed with this_product at_all  i_thought i could save some money by buying this cheap version of a metal shelving unit  i_needed it when i_bought it or otherwise i would of returned it  it came rusted in the corners and the  silver coating  flaking all over  doesn_t come_with wheels like larger versions  
so cute  great_price  i_love this shelf  i_ve been remodeling our upstairs myself for a_few weeks and i was doing my craft room and kitchen and was getting a_few  i_need  items and ran across this for my craft room  i_do a_lot of diy and a ton of painting  furniture  our walls  everything  so_i_needed something with decent sized shelves for cans of paint  things like that  but i_didn_t want_to spend an arm and a leg  i am remodeling an entire house  i_can_t blow our budget on one room  so this fit the bill  shipping was fast  package came_in_good_shape  i put it together in about 8 minutes  at first i was concerned  it was shorter than_i_expected  clearly i_didn_t exactly read dimensions on the_product description   but i figured for the_price   hey  i_ll make it work  and work it did  it was perfect_for what i_needed  and honestly in a_month  i_m probably going_to order a_couple more    it s sturdy and very pretty  understand the poles between the shelves are plastic  but you can_t really tell unless you re touching them  i have pretty heavy supplies on it and it doen t lean or shake any  i have a crate full of spray paints on the top shelf and when taking it down or putting it up i have to worries about it breaking or toppling over on me  it matches my room perfectly and i couldn_t be happier  i_m quite happy it s_not taller than_it is  seeing as how i_myself am vertically challenged and have to_use a step stool to_get that spray paint crate off the top shelf without getting flattened  overall  waaaaay better quality than_i was expecting honestly  space saver excellent for the_price  not as sturdy as a wood table but does amazingly the job  i_needed to declutter my kitchen counter and i_ve found this   i just displayed 3 tiers because_it was too high for my kitchen and i_used the 4th under my sink cabinet  on the top shelf is the microwave  on the second is my mini oven and on the bottom shelf is the rice cooker and things i put here and there  the bottom shelf is definitely the sturdiest  so happy_with my purchase  i recommend this  i_love the size of it i_love the size of it  it s_not too big but not too small  it doesn_t take up a_lot of space so_it s perfect_for small rooms like in apartments or townhouses  it fits a_lot of stuff on it and it s sturdy for the_price  the shelves are sturdy enough that i was able_to stack a bunch of books on it as_well as two laptops on another shelf  it was_not difficult to assemble and i_love the color  works_great in my bathroom    i have deliberately waited quite awhile to voice my opinion on this_product because_i_wanted to_see how well it would hold up  i_do_not have anything really heavy on it  so_i won_t comment on its ability to hold weight or not  but i_do have this in my bathroom  right next to my shower  this is why i waited to write this  i_wanted to_see how well it would fair in a room that is almost constantly moist and damp  it has far exceeded my expectations  the laminated veneer has_not peeled or become unattached in any way  nor has_it developed those little blister bubbles that you sometimes see on pieces with veneer  putting this shelf together was a breeze  it was delivered about half an hour before i_needed to leave for work  and i was able_to inbox it  screw the pieces together and move it into my bathroom all by myself  and still had time to spare before leaving for work  while i would in no way describe this shelf as flimsy  it is light weight  so_if you have little ones or even elderly people in your home or office i would recommend that you anchor the shelf to the wall just to be safe  although i have not felt the need_to_do this in my own home  i am very_happy_with this shelf  and plan to purchase at least one or two more that i plan to try out with books  five_stars very_happy and purchased more  a solid shelving system for this price range i_like these shelves a_lot  they re a_little shorter than_i pictured in my head  but worked out perfectly for my craft room  while i wouldn_t overload them with super heavy items  they re pretty study  the shelving system doesn_t rock too much  stays together well  i_like the color of the wood laminate  very neutral and bright  pros  sturdier than anticipated bright and clean a simple but well thought out design  with caps on the top shelf to cover the  pole holes   and small feet on the bottom to slightly elevate the shelf system  the laminate is a pleasant wood pattern and well wrapped  only a_little laminate edge is visible around the shelf  as seen in the pictures   cons  a_little smaller than_i pictured  couldn_t hold heavy books  but that s_not what i_bought it for  so no big deal there   errrr that s about it  this isn_t a high end solid wood shelf  but for what i paid i am more_than pleased_with the_quality  pictured  the full picture has all_of my art room stuff on it  and a yard stick leaning in front for size comparison  the_other two allow you to_see the wood pattern and the tiny visible edge of the laminate  i had to_get pretty close to be able_to_see that  selves for product and organized good produce for your work i_love it my favorite purchase for 2017  love ittttttttt       this little shelf fits perfectly in my little office  right in a_little corner as_if_it was made for that spot  my staff was jealous and it inspired them to order one also for behind their desk  its perfect_for things you need close by with out being obstructive and in the_way  matches the rest of my office furniture perfectly  i have several large file folders stored on it  paper for my printer  a plant and some other documents  its beautiful  and for the_price   i_can_t rave enough  it is well made  strong  sturdy and super easy_to put together  i literally put this together in 5 minutes myself with no tools  i will definetly purchase more from this collection  you can_t go wrong trust me     who ever thought of this concept needs to be rewarded  economical and useful    very practical  and easy_to assemble  i_m 6 months pregnant and needed to create more space for the 2nd baby in my daughter s room and this worked perfectly  i really liked that it was easy_to assemble  no screws or tools    just really good_forearms that you ll need_to twist these poles in and done  i completed the build in less_than 30 min  my only complaint is that i really wish the was a tad bit wider so_i could fit 2 storage boxes on one shelf instead_of 1  the picture with the divider was a_bit decieving  but now_i get why they had it since those boxes are costum to that shelving unit  my daughter has a montessori_like set_up in her room so_if she s in the closet  i_m not worried about this falling on her since_it s so light weight  that if_it somehow did   which i highly doubt  she wouldn_t get harmed  maybe a_little shaken up  but probably not hurt  it did come_with a mount to fix it to the wall for that reason  but i_didn_t use it yet  other_than that  a_very inexpensive way to organize a baby closet  i all probably get another_one_in the future when the girls are a_little older and have accumulated more stuff  i give it 2 thumbs up  these are great_for adding shelves to any room for a_great_price  very_easy_to assemble  sturdy  extremely affordable  there was some slight damage to the corners of the press particle board shelves of one_of the two i_bought but nothing worth sending back or complaining about  all the pvc pieces including the end caps were pristine and well packed  the pvc tubing connect_to each other very_well_and do_not rock or slip once tightened  i have a fairly weighty bose 301 book shelf speaker on the third shelf and a klipsch dolby atmos speaker on the top shelf of each making them very top heavy but i am confident that unless i_do something stupid or there is an earthquake they ll be fine  they are both sitting directly on carpet and would tip over with a_good nudge but they are steady and don_t move or sway  i have both furinno shelves fairly far away from my wall so_i_cannot anchor them using the enclosed wall anchors but that is definitely a_nice option  for the_price_and functionality the furinno turn n tube 4 tier shelves are a_great_buy  no tools required   easy assembly i was super pleasantly surprised with this  the_box had 4 wood  particle board  flats which were slightly more impressive than the plastic i_expected  12 plastic legs and 4 caps  and i think something to anchor it to the wall even  no tools  directions  or pictures which i was thrilled not to need  you just screw one leg into another with the shelves in between  all the holes and groves were properly placed and fit together exactly like they should and none_of the shelves were cracked or chipped which  at this price  is_nothing short of a miracle  the whole thing took about ten minutes and that was with my 2   4 yr olds helping me  best purchase i ever made these are the_best thing since sliced bread  took all_of 5 minutes to put one together and look at_all the stuff they hold  i_use them in my craft room  and i_m thinking of getting another_one to_set_up_and take down at craft fairs  these guys are brilliant  they make a_lot of different types of furniture that doesn_t require tools  the tubes screw into each other and they hold up great  love love love    it works  it serves the purpose and it looks decent  i_didnt want_to spend a_lot of money on shelves and this is the cheapest option i could find  it does look a_little cheap overall but it works for me and my simple cute kitchen  i also got a_little creative to_make it work for me   i_purchased two   combined them  and left a_few shelves off   voila   i_got adjustable shelf heights to fit my coffee machine      it does wobble   but it comes_with a_few wall attachments that i_didnt use  i screwed it all together pretty strongly  it takes some muscle   i also put some heavy bottles on the bottom to keep it more stable  simple  minimal  and easy_to assemble  i_love this_product  fast_shipping  super easy_to assemble  plan on painting it all white to match my decor  but overall extremely happy_with my purchase  will be buying others in the set to match  convient and sturdy i_love this shelf  its just what i_needed  i_use it to display myself and my boyfriends fragrances  it was really simply and easy_to put together  i barely used the directions  i_purchased thus item for  22 10 so_it was a_great_buy  i plan to_buy another when the_price drops back down  easiest assembly ever  exactly_as_described  exactly_as_described and the instructions said it would take about 15 minutes to put together only took me about 5 and no tools required  heavy enough_to look nice but easy for me to move if needed  i also realized i_dont have to_use all the shelves should i ever want_to_make it shorter you can just easily take one down and re apply the end caps  the_only_thing_i wish was different was that the top end caps were wooden vs plastic to give it a more seamless look but buying the black it blends well  great_product great stand for displaying my die cast cars  now this is made of pressboard and pvc pipe     but it looks_like its wood  it does_not look  cheap  by any means  this is in my  man cave  where eclectic is the operative word and this fits right in  one other thing  i_don_t know how they make a product this good_for this amount of money  i_mean this is really nice for the small sum it cost  its sturdy and i had no trouble putting it together      which is amazing because_i have a terrible time putting anything together  five_stars all the_way  does what i_wanted and assembly was a snap this was an incredibly wonderful purchase for what we needed  i just needed a shelf for a smaller sized bedroom to display collectibles  the fact that this requires no tools at_all to put together is a huge plus  it took me all_of 10 minutes to put it together and get it up  now  you get what you pay_for  don_t expect a well made wood shelf with strong bars  the bars are made of plastic and the  wood  is particle board  the finish looks decent but you can_tell it is cheap  despite all_of that  it is exactly what i_expected and what was_advertised so there are no surprises here  it is a_little wobbly  but sturdy enough_to put fairly heavy collectibles on it without a_problem  it looks nice  especially from a distance you can_t tell the bars are made of plastic  the_purchased the light cherry black set and it looks very_nice  for the_price  this is an outstanding find  one additional thing_i_like about this is even though i_purchased the four tier shelf  you don_t have to_use all four shelfs if_it doesn_t_work for you  you can stop at whatever level works and put the caps on the top at that point  we almost stopped at 3 shelfs  but decided to_use all four  i_liked this so_much  i_bought another last night for a different room  if you have limited space or budget and need something that is easy_to put together  looks good_and does what it is supposed to   this is a_great purchase  great shelf for the_price i_purchased this to put my sewing fabric on and its perfect  the_unit isnt that tall which works_great_for me  im 5 feet and it is about a foot shorter than me  easy_to put together  true to picture  only warning would be that each shelf is only meant to hold 15 lbs  they re very_nice considering the_price  the shelves are thin and the legs are plastic  that being said it s surprisingly sturdy and fairly attractive  i_bought two and both went together quickly  stand straight and neither have had any issues_with tipping  if you do have issues_with tipping they include a_little wall mount kit with each shelf so you don_t need_to worry  great_for toy storage  this shelf is a_little smaller than_expected  only because_i_didnt read the full descriptionwhoops    but its perfect  it fits my needs better_than_expected  it looks really nice despite the low price tag  its_not too wobbly either  perfect_for organizing toys in the living room  and it was so easy_to assemble  it took all_of 5 minutes to_set it up_and 30 seconds to put things on it in an organized manner  insanely easy_to put together insanely easy_to put together  did it by myself  sitting in a chair  in about 5 minutes  15 minutes total from opening the_box to putting the shelf in place  the rods are plastic  but that didn_t bother me  feels very sturdy  one shelf came_with a bent cracked corner due to shipping  i just put that one on the bottom and put that corner toward the wall  can_t_even tell  small  sleek  great_for nyc apartment  exactly what i_needed for my nyc apartment   this is slim enough_to fit in my shoebox apartment  but big enough_to hold all my items   easy assembly   no tools required  took me ten minutes  it is a_little wobbly  but not enough_to keep me from putting my wine rack on the top shelf  it also comes_with a plastic tie if you wanted to secure it to something more stable  nice shelf for simple storage i wouldn_t use this_as a bookshelf or media shelf  kind of cheap and tacky for that but it s great_for storing things in a closet or basement maybe  super easy_to put together  took me less_than 5 mins  great_for the_price this is cheap furniture  so don_t expect anything fancy  but for what i paid for it   32   i_m pleased  the shelves are press board  with the veneer only on the top and sides  not the bottoms of the shelves  the poles are sturdy plastic  it could not possibly be easier to put this_unit together  you literally just stack the pieces and screw in the poles  it probably took 2 minutes  the_unit is very lightweight  so_if you have children  you ll have to anchor it  like any bookcase storage shelf  and warn them not to climb it  we are using it to hold a ton of board games  and it s very practical for that purpose  great organizer  i_got these to organize a closet in my home office  and they are perfect  i was a_little worried that they wouldn_t be strong enough for everything_i_wanted to put on them  but they are perfect  i have textbooks  printer paper  envelopes  writing tablets  industrial sized staplers and hole punches  and plastic containers with computer accessories on them  and they are holding up beautifully  not only that  there was more room on these than_i_thought there was going_to be  it has organized the closet perfectly  great organizer and space saver this is an absolute most have  great organizer and space saver  looks really great in my room for my entertainment setup  it was a snap to put together  probably about 10 15mins and it was ready for use  very sturdy on thicj carpet  mine did arrive damaged  some of the shelf boards were damaged on the corners but that was the fault of ups  still  everything went together flawlessly  no warps or bends  brilliant product  for the_price_and brand  i was skeptic  in the past  furinno and i have not had good times together  recently i_bought two different shelves by them   since_i have become rather heavy in buying figurines and candles  needed displays    and have been pleasantly surprised both times  they truly have no need for screws or any tools and both of them arrived_in perfect condition  box and product  theres no splitting wood  and they look more on the expensive end  honestly  especially the taller shelf i_bought  it took maybe ten minutes to put both together  if that  really surprised at the good quality and maybe restored my faith in the brand here  what great_deal     for the_price  i think this is perfect  simple  stylish and seems_to be sturdy so_far  terrific value no tools required but incredibly sturdy these are a terrifc value they go togather with ease but they are very sturdy the_way they fit togather is seemless and they dont need_tools and they are even very visually appealing i will be buying more and i already bought 7 i am very_happy_with them this was a perfect perchase since_it is compact and does_not take     i had been looking_for such a thing for our office so that will not take that much of space and could handle our macro wave  kettle  and coffe maker on it  also  all the cups and tea bags and all other stuff that we could share in the office  this was a perfect perchase since_it is compact and does_not take a_lot of place   which is the winning point specialy of you have a small place   also the color was perfect and was matching other furniture in the office  black   the material is good  it is strong enough_to handle all the things that i_mentioned  easily  generally  it is perfect_for the_price      know what to expect for the_price but i_love these  they are exactly what i was looking     i_didnt know what to expect for the_price but i_love these  they are exactly what i was looking_for to display my pop figures  super easy_to put together and sturdier than_i_expected for the_price  cant speak for the_other colors but the darker look makes it look more expensive than they are  already ordered a second one and may be ordering more in the future  perfect_for my game systems  i was redoing my gaming setup_and i_needed shelves that were expandable  unobtrusive  and easy_to put together to put my game systems on  i figured i_d take a risk on these because they were cheap and had good reviews  it was a synch putting them together and only took about 10 minutes to_get them in the configuration i_needed  the packaging was_good_and they weren t damaged in the mail  they re perfect_for my needs and i highly_recommend them if you re in need of a versatile shelving unit  good_value this is definitely a_good buy_for the_money  my only complaint is that it could be a_little sturdier but for the_price  i_m not complaining  it also came a_little scuffed up but i_didn_t buy it for it to look nice  i_bought it for functionality  i have two of these shelves  i_needed shelves that i could throw away if we ever moved and not feel guilty about it  i_bought one then a_few days later i_bought another  we have one on each side of our tv for all the books that were in a closet and so that we didn_t look like squatters with only 3 items of furniture  we do_not have children to climb on the shelves to really test their durability but i really cant complain at_all  we  it was really just me but i am blaming my husband as_well since he watched me do it  put the shelves together upside down but it worked out well since we just put the second together the_same way  great  holds a_great_deal of weight  believe it or not    we bought two of these and it supports a 40 lb lizard cage  we wanted to maximize vertical space in our new home so we mounted the lizard on top of two of these tiered units  the cage is easily 2ft x 4 ft  we were then able_to push our couch right_up next to the tables so that the bottom of the cage is right behind the couch  we can_then store miscellaneous items in the shelving and it is out_of sight of our living room  also  our cats love to sit on top of the lizard cage because of the warm light which it emanates  often we have our two cats  weighing 20 lb total between them  plus the 40 lb lizard cage on two of these units  it shakes when the cats jump on and off of it but we have never been afraid of the cage falling or the shelving units breaking  perfect_for our needs  perfect    i_ordered this for the low price not knowing what to expect  and i was pleasantly surprised  i couldn_t believe how easy it was to put

shelves are very_easy_to assemble  no tools requied  the shelves are attractive and are remarkably sturdy  considering that they are particle board  the instructions say that each shelf can hold 15

shelves to the wall  this is a_great little bookcase this is a_great little bookcase  it s super easy_to assemble  and holds the weight of full shelves of books perfectly well  i_can_t imagine it s the most stable bookcase as_it s sitting on four posts  so_if you have an animal or child who might knock or pull it down  you should probably go for a real bookcase  but for my uses  i have no_issues  for the_price  definitely worth it   this shelving unit met my needs perfectly  i am an artist  and have two tons of shhhhh everywhere of random art things i collect and projects unfinished  it holds up a_lot of stuff  and even a ten pack of painting files on the top shelf hasn t broke it down  just bent it a lil  my girlfriend put it up quickly_and easily  wish i could put two up   but the dimensions are too big for the spot i_need it in  planning on painting it in the future  and i will update on that venture  looks good  easy_to assemble  durable  inexpensive any time my teenage grandson s room starts looking cluttered  i buy him another_one_of these shelves  it always inspires him to_do a super clean_and rearrange his stuff  this is my fifth shelf from this manufacturer and they all were easy_to assemble  look good  and are holding up well with use  this_one came undamaged with all necessary pieces and my grandson had it together in about four minutes  nice storage shelves i_m using this for my daughter s play nook in the living room  it s_not heavy duty and she s old enough_to not pull furniture on herself  otherwise  i wouldn_t use this with small children  i_ve purchased similar bookshelves in the past and these are a decent quality for the_price  it took five minutes to assemble   no directions needed  this would be great to_use in a walk in closet or a craft room as_well  it s a_great height  i_use it to store paints and     i think i was able_to put it together before the delivery guy pulled off  it s a_great height  i_use it to store paints and paint brushes and other party stuff  it s the perfect size for a small space or if you are looking_for storage that doesn_t take up the entire room  and bonus it great looking  i could use it as a regular fixture in my kids room or for other areas_in my home  awesome price_and great_value  five bucks per shelf  good_deal  nice basic shelving for an inexpensive price  won_t hold your heaviest car parts but books should be fine  your wrists and forearms will get a workout twisting this_thing together  can_t beat it for  20  perfect i absolutely love this shelf  i have my tv on the top shelf  my xbox on the 2nd shelf  a small picture printer amd a can of change on the 3rd and some notebooks on the bottom and it works_perfectly  it s strong enough_to hold all_of this  especially the tv  and is quite sturdy  if you have a kid that s learning how to walk or hyper dogs or something_i wouldn_t recommend it because a large amount of tugging or pushing will knock it over  but it s very_nice  it also only took me like 5 minutes to put together  which was great  this is one_of the most efficient and easy pieces of furniture i_ve ever received this is one_of the most efficient and easy pieces of furniture i_ve ever received  the pillars twist into each shelf and it can be put together in 10 minutes or less  it is wonderful for the_price you pay  the wood is mdf  with a coating of the style wood choice  i bumped one_of my corners and it peeled off  but it is no issue for me  it is_not noticeable  it is great_for apartment living  makes a_nice display for dcor  and is very space saving  it is much taller than_i_thought  excellent buy  i will definitely be investing in more furinno furniture soon  best buy ever     mom on a budget     im a scentsy consultant and im a single mother on a budget so this worked perfectly for my scentsy office and make sure to_buy the matching pieces that amazon recommends because_i_did that as_well_and it all worked out so wonderfully for me  oh and did i_mention the set_up is a piece of cake and i am aweful at putting anything together  great_buy      fits nicely in the space  holds books well  slight cosmetic blemishes  otherwise  easy_to assemble and use  this_unit goes together fairly easily  without tools  and though it had some slight cosmetic blemishes  lightly visible  cracks  on some of the side laminate  nothing to_return it for  it fit well in the space  and held the books well  one note  this is_not  repeat  not  a heavy duty shelf  so_it will have that limitation  i e   for how much weight it takes   otherwise  a_nice finish  i_m trying_to contact the manufacturer to_see if they sell an extra shelf and legs  if so  great  if not  not a_problem  also came_with an  eye  hook  and other little bits  to secure to a wall   but i_ve balanced out what i put on it  so_it shouldn t fall over  nice of them to included it though  good light duty shelving  they do the job these worked out fine for me  i_needed something light weight and easy_to assemble to organize a small attic with only a pull down ladder for access and these did the job  for those who are wondering  yes you can combine these units to create taller shelves but just know that the bottom of each shelf is unfinished  they also come_with attachable anchors to secure them to the wall so they won_t tip over  i_m not using them for decor but if you re on a really tight budget i think these would help you furnish a home economically  fine 4 shelf units  ok as 7 shelf unit  i_bought two of these 4 shelf units  to assemble together as a taller 7 shelf unit  plus a spare shelf   some parts   configured this way  the whole unit is a_bit wobbly  in fairness  it was designed to be a 4 shelf unit   but it s acceptable for my needs  it does have a_bit of a  dark feel  because the vertical supports are black  i_might spend time time painting them  probably multiple light colors  to lighten the mood in that corner of the room  great organizer  pleased_with the shelves  took 5min to put together  has 4 shelves and can be used_for so many purposes  i_bought it to store extra snacks since my kitchen has a small pantry  perfect and color true to ad  nice inexpensive storage solution i_needed to_add some storage to a room  and i was drawn in by this because of the low price_and the description of an easy_tool free construction  with that in mind  i_m pretty darn happy_with it  it does literally take about 5 minutes to put together  maybe 10 if you want_to be extra vigilant  and the process is so simple that you will hardly need the included   3 step  instruction manual  the shelves are sturdy enough_to hold up to a surprising amount of weight without issue  it s_not just a  display  shelf  you can use it for actual storage  it s obviously not as stiff as something with full wooden construction  so_it does have a tiny bit of wobble to it if you bump it accidentally  however  i will say that i_m constantly accidentally knocking it with my computer chair  and the amount of  wobble  that takes place isn_t_even enough_to knock down the little funko pops and other figures that i keep on the top shelf  i_m not at_all worried about it tipping or falling over  although it probably helps that i have heavy stacks of books on the bottom shelf  in any case  i wouldn_t hesitate to_buy another_one_of these in the future  you can adjust the height by adding removing shelves  so_if you bought two of these for example  you can build a 5 shelf unit and a 3 shelf unit  instead_of two 4 shelf units  without needing any extra parts  it came pretty safely packed  there was a tiny scratch on the top of one_of my shelves  but i_might have done that myself when removing the pieces from the_box  it s a_good option for college students like me  cheap and easy_to move  but also for anyone who would like quick and cheap storage that doesn_t necessarily have cheap looks or performance  sturdy  and easy_to assemble these are attractive  functional  sturdy  and easy_to assemble  you can add as many tiers as you want  within reason  lol  if you purchase more  i_got the grey with black poles  i_ve bought like 8 of them now  i_m really surprised with the aesthetic for such a cheap shelf  fit all my books  movies  games  etc  the shelves fit vinyl records perfectly as_well  worth the_price  i_needed a shelf to display my action figures and this_one works_well  it s pretty sturdy my figures never fall down from anyone walking by or anything  i added led stick lights to the top of the middle shelves for added lighting  this shelf is very_easy_to put together  no need for tools  you just twist the legs into the shelf very_easy takes like 10 min  for the_price_i would definitely buy_again  i recommend this_product  looks surprisingly good  better_than the picture imo looks surprisingly good  better_than the picture imo  easy_to_install  no need for tools  bottom of wood is_not laminated so_if this bothers you  don_t get this  i_use for storage room so_i_don_t care so_much how it looks  it s also really short but meets my needs  going_to order one more  great_product   great_price_for a_great_product  this was very very_easy_to_set_up_and so_far i_ve had no_issues_with it  i_ve had this up for about two weeks and i keep all_of my hair related products on it  it matched perfectly with the furniture i already had as_well  i_got the dark wood   storage problem answered  exactly what i_needed  i_bought 2 for my apartment that lacked storage  easy_to assemble  you literally just screw in all the legs  add a shelf  repeat   the plastic legs made me doubt the durability  but so_far i have no_complaints  one_of the pictures is taken in my coat closet so you can see how compact it is  
if you have the room  this shelf is worth the_money i live in an apartment  so_i_can_t be drilling holes for floating shelves  nor is there much room for the bulkier  solid wood cabinet shelf  so this fits the bill perfectly  function wise  i_got the dark espresso version  which is the color of dark chocolate but with more brown  if that makes sense  looks rather modern  by no means in a traditional looking room will this blend in  what with the plastic pipes  any who  likes    each shelf  wood plank  holds according to the manual  89 lbs  which is more_than enough for my needs   no tools are needed    there are only a_few steps to assemble each floor of the shelf  then you repeat   little wobbly but rigid nonetheless dislikes    the end caps for the topmost pipes were slightly squished  two of four   so_i had to_use pliers to squeeze them back into shape  this isn_t enough_to warrant a star deduction though   doesn_t make me breakfast took about 15 minutes to assemble  possibly less if you forgo reading the instructions  if you ve built one_of these already  you can assemble this shelf in 10 or less minutes   you can also disassemble  i presume  the shelf if you need_to move  you just reverse the order of the_way you put it together  i actually do have enough room for another_one so_if_i so desire  i shall buy another  great shelf for the_money   unless your end caps are squished from shipping  then some pliers can help shape them back the shelves are about as_good as you d expect them to be the shelves are about as_good as you d expect them to be  the_product definitely doesn_t ship perfect  there are some nicks here and there and a_lots of saw dust left behind  no big deal  the assembly is very straight forward and simple but the tubes are pretty tough to spin and tighten  a_good interim solution i_bought two of these  one for either side of the tv  for my new apartment when i ran out_of money to_buy better bookcases  these are great_for what they are  plastic items that you just screw together  to clarify  the side pieces literally fit into the shelves and you tighten them in  you do_not need metal screws or a screwdriver  i would not use them for anything very heavy  but i had two boxes of books that i really wanted to_get onto shelves  and by putting the heaviest ones on the bottom and progressively lighter items on the higher shelves  i think it worked out well  these would be good_for dorm rooms  for closet storage  possibly for garages or laundry rooms  if you just needed an inexpensive way to store light items  when i save the_money for nice  wooden bookcases or storage units  i will use these for closet storage in my walk in bedroom closet  or perhaps just donate them to a charitable organization  recommended  as long as you realize what you are getting  and what the limitations are  exactly what i_needed  looks pretty  this is a_very cheap bookshelf  so you can_t expect awesome quality  that settled  i really like this_product  it s super easy_to build  doesn_t need any tools   just your hands and 15 minutes  the planks are made of wood composite  but look good enough  i chose the beech white color  and it looks pretty against the wall  mine doesn_t wobble  as other reviews have said  maybe it s because_i placed it in a corner so_it s supported by two walls  overall  it doesn_t look as cheap as_it is  and although it s obvious the shelves won_t stand a ton of weight  they look sturdy enough for a_couple_of books and other stuff that isn_t very heavy  this is_not a shelf for books only  because_it won_t stand the weight  but you can definitely store some books and then something else  please check the dimensions  as this is smaller in width than your usual bookshelf  again  it s_not a bookshelf   cheap  easy_to assemble and very convenient  basically you re getting 4 wood shelves and some plastic tubes that twist lock into one another  assembly takes less_than 10 minutes and even a caveman can do it  the black grey version does look significantly cheaper than the beech white  you can safely store and stack whatever you want   books  movies  figurines  etc  its pretty strong  i_m not advocating using this to store a safe or your bowling ball collection because the wooden shelves aren t thick enough for that kind of weight  i have a blu ray player  wii  wii u  xbox 360  and_playstation 2 on this rack and they all fit perfectly  i_can fit 2 consoles on 1 shelf  with breathing room so they re not right on top of each other  i_purchased this and the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish and i_must say the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish is by far the better deal for just like  2 more  it s more visually impressive on display and doesn_t look as cheap as this black grey version  also_its more stable  if_i touch the black grey shelf  it rocks side to side a_few times  the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish just seems much more stable  at the bottom of the furinno nw889be 4 tier shelf storage shelves cabinet bookcase bookshelf bookshelves with bins  beech finish you get an extra piece of wood that forms a divider on the bottom shelf where you can slide the bins into  and i think perhaps that is what provides better strength and stability to that shelf overall  great shelf for the_price  looks just as_advertised  came_in a_very compact box  the bars screw into each other  not the shelves  so_it is super easy_to put together  and looks_like it won_t be a_problem to_take apart for easy moving as_well  ours had minor damage on one_of the shelves  the corner looked like it had been scratched  and the finishing came off  talked to an amazon rep  and they were able_to_take care of it though  it s a_little unstable on carpet  but with a_little bit of weight on the bottom shelf  it looks_like it won_t tip over  the shelf came_with a cable tie and screw to attach to a wall  but we didn_t have a drill bit  the_only other thing_is each shelf is recommended not to hold more_than 15 pounds  so look elsewhere if you re looking_for a heavy weight shelf  easy_to assemble   affordable it was_incredibly easy_to assemble  took me 1 minute to read the guide and 5 minutes to put everything together  this comes from someone who almost never assembles any furniture   i_got this shelf for my kitchen because_i finally got tired of looking at_all my pots and pans on the stove  it doesn_t come_with any oder  which is a big relief since_i_m quite sensitive to paint smells   and holds my pots and pans very_well  however  it is indeed held together with plastic tubes  so be aware and don_t put heavy stuff on each shelf  especially top ones    leave your microwave on the kitchen counter  i_can_tolerate the wobbly here and there since_it s so cheap  and as long as_i_don_t run into it  i_don_t think any will fall apart  all_in all  it s a_good kitchen addition  good stand i have had this before and the saying goes   you get what you pay_for   well with this nifty little space saving shelf you actually get a_little more  i have a 19 inch flat screen on top  a playstation  wii  saga  bluetooth speaker  router  sub woofer speaker and a shelf full of games all on the entire unit  i_do_not anchor it to the wall  and i_do_not move it around  i_dust and sweep under that s about it  it will last  i only threw out my old one because_i_wanted a larger unit  worked_great_for my needs  as others_noted the shelves are easy_to assemble  easy_to tip over and easily scratched  i put them between end of my computer desk   the wall  so stability isn_t an issue for me  you can use two or more of the shelf riser assemblies  three was almost exactly desktop height  but i_used all four  easily holds my computer tower on top  with power strip  joysticks  etc on the lower shelves  great quality shelf for a_good_price i_bought this_as a shelf for my for my dining room to display books and small picture frames and other little figurines that i have had sitting packed away  i_used the bottom shelf for some heavy hardcover books  the second to bottom shelf i_used_for books and i_used my owl bookends to keep them from toppling over  i put smaller paperback books on the second shelf  also with small bookends on the side  on the top i put a_few small picture frames and some other small treasures that i have wanted to display  a small framed collage my son made  a_couple_of glass figures  a tiny eiffel tower from my trip to france years ago      i_like that this came_with a small cord so this can be fastened to the wall  granted  it is_not going_to stop the shelf from falling if someone rips it roughly  but when my ten pound cat decided to try jumping on the shelf  it didn_t come toppling down  this was so easy_to put together  i just screwed on the plastic bars onto the pressed board shelves  i think this looks very_nice in my dining room  it is_not an expensive piece of furniture  but i really like how the black and silver  yes plastic bars  but they are silver colored  stands out  i would buy another_one_of these  and i_may in the future  air it out first  then it s great  great  used it in my closet to organize shoes and purses  super easy_to put together and looks just like the pictures  only complaint is that when it arrives  it has a_very strong smell  i think it is just from the chemicals that are used to coat the  wood   but if_i had to_do it over again  i would build it  then sit it outside to air out for 2 3 days before bringing it inside  furrinno 4 tier shelf unit arrived_in_good_shape   just one very small nic on one_of the corners of one shelf   really super easy_to put together takes about 5 minutes  it s really lightweight   no horrible smells just as_described   got it for the workshop and it fits two of the 12x8x10 canvas bins on each shelf for organizing   i_like the fact it is so light weight making it very_easy_to move around and that is why i_went with this rather than solid wood product   easy_setup it s easy_to_setup_and the shelf looks relatively nice  i_do have to_say that the top and bottom tiers are the weakest since  it doesn_t have the top and bottom support bars  so_if you put more_than 15 lbs on the top and bottom tiers the wood bends slightly  but i haven_t had any issues_with it and it seems_to be able_to handle a decent amount of things  cheap   functional  perfect_for a college dorm room apartment  i was looking_for a cheap and durable shelf to hold my keurig k200 in my room  this was_not what i was looking_for  at least on carpet  it s wobbly and does_not seem like it would hold the weight  i wasn_t disappointed really though because for the_price_it really doesn_t make too much of an impact on my wallet  it s size and portability make it really appealing for me  with some minor adjustments  i was able_to_make it fit into my living space  setup couldn_t have been more straightforward  it took me 10 minutes to unpack the shelf and assemble it  to me  it s a welcomed addition that adds some more storage options for me which is a definite plus  although it did_not meet what i had originally set out for before  i_can still find a place for it somewhere which is great  small and cute small and cute i really like this shelf  we live in a small apartment its perfect in width for my needs  it was easy_to put together which i appreciate  the_only_things i_didnt like is that it had a_few scuff marks and a tiny chip at the top  i_ordered two  i_wanted a_little more height for one and used two tiers from one for the_other  i_made a mini shelf with what was left  functional shelving unit for light loads i was looking_for easy_to assemble shelves for my dorm room that could be easily dismantled for storage at the end of the year  this_unit works_perfectly  it took probably five minutes to assemble  this isn_t quality furniture by any means   all the components are cheap  composite board and plastic tubing  and look almost disposable  but i_don_t think anyone would expect more for the_price_and description  there was some damage out_of the package  which doesn_t really bother me  it also does wobble a_little and i wouldn_t put too much weight on it  but i_m overall happy_with it  money well spent i just received this   had it assembled in a matter of minutes  the height is good next to my desk for my printer  internet boxes   some other misc  stuff  this would be a_great piece in any small space to put misc  stuff on  over time heavy items would damage it  but  it s obviously not made to be a  life time  piece of furniture  though i think it could last a_very long time  great_product at a_great_price good inexpensive shelves that go together easily  hold all my books without a_problem  i_did stack to the_back_of teh shelf as they will tip over easily on carpet but over all these are great inexpensive shelving for starter or temporary houseing  they are not designed to move once you put them in place  you can move them but you want_to be careful moving them without disassembly  easy_to assemble  they say it takes around 15 mins easy_to assemble  they say it takes around 15 mins  most of that is unpacking and opening the bags with the tubes   make sure to follow the weight limits  also  for stability  if you re putting anything heavy on it  put it on the bottom shelf  any shelving units should always go heaviest on bottom lightest at the top   overall  though  its stable  my cat likes the middle shelf and it s_not on the steadies of surfaces  but it hasn t tipped  these look like they might be tall but there are not these look like they might be tall but there are not  worked well for what i_needed them for  which was to hold misc stuff for my home office easy_to assemble  good_for lightweight storage bought this to_use as extra food storage space in the kitchen  it works_well for my purpose  and it looks nice especially for the_price  very_easy_to assemble  no tools you just screw everything together  takes about 10 mins  i will say  however  that it is_not the most durable nor meant for heavy weight  even in the directions it advises you not to load it up with more_than 15lb per shelf  great affordable option for lightweight storage  good  perfect_for what i_needed it for in a small space  looks nice  easy_to put together  i_m just bumming i_can_t buy replacement legs  i took it apart for a move and the legs are mia somewhere across the country     movers lost them  oh well  great_product  if they ever sell replacement legs  i_d get them  so_i_ll hold onto the panels for a_bit  for the_money  can_t beat it  being deployed to afghanistan leaves little to no options for furnishing your hooch  at my last location we built shelves and desks from scarp wood  at the location that i_ordered these shelves for  i was_in a tent  i had little to no room  instead_of taking up the marines time making me shelves and a desk i_ordered both items  here at amazon  from furinno  i figure when i rip out i will just leave them here for the next guy  these shelves work great_for my needs and i_can see them being good in a dorm situation  setup was a cinch  no tools needed  just screw the pieces together and you re done  a coupe of corners had some marking  like something hit it hard or had too much pressure applied  this did_not impact the ability to assemble the_product nor will it impact it s ability to hold something  i_don_t blame the packing or the_company as_i_know how mail gets treated once_it hits the military mail side  all_in all i am very_happy_with these shelves as they are compact yet serve the purpose i_need while deployed  great_for the_price  i_got this shelf to_go in a closet for paper towels  toilet paper and cleaning supplies  i put it together in 5 minutes or less  super easy  it is light weight but seems sturdy  the shelves are just the right size to lay paper towel rolls down  i would purchase this again  even to_use out in the open  the_only reason i_did_not give 5_stars is one_of the shelves had worn marks scratches on the finish  but  since_it is in a closet i_don_t really care  great look price functionality  but hard to assemble    manufacturing consistency problem  looks great  price is great  the_only downside is it was extremely hard for me to screw the tubes together  to the extent that i_thought that i had a faulty product because_it was so hard i_thought the threading didn_t line up  i searched reviews to_see if others had similar problems  but apparently most thought it was hardest to screw in the top caps  which i_thought screwed in extremely easily   i_m wondering if their manufacturing machine is just inconsistent or there s a bad machine on the ground  perhaps all_of my normal tubes went through that machine while others  top caps came out faulty  glad it s finally put together  we like it so_far we like it so_far  bought it for our bedrooom to put a flat screen tv on  its light cherry but matches our medium colored oak furniture  hope it holds up  our flat screen is pretty big  
1 was perfect  the_other was flawed  i_bought two of these shelves  the_first one was a 5 star shelving unit  no flaws  perfect  the second unit is why i_ve marked you down a_bit  there were stains all over one_of the shelves  there are some type of sticky smudges on the black shelf top  and on the underside of same board  there are fingerprints  which i_can only assume are in oil of some kind  but it s the index finger  middle  and ring ringer  a clear print of those fingers right down to the 2nd knuckles  i would have given you 5_stars if there was any consistency between the two shelves i_ordered  but you don_t get a 5 star rating for shoddy work_and a lack of quality control  as for as putting them together  it was very_easy  but also very painful  you have to twist and twist and twist the poles  which screw into each other  and my forearms were killing me after a_few minutes  this is where having a man in the house might have come in handy  but they do seem sturdy enough for my plants and crystals  i also like the_way the_units look  very clean_and open  all other shelves i_ve had are closed on each end  but since these are open  it provides really good light opportunities for plants  i would like to_get another unit for the spare room and use it as a pantry shelf  but again  with the lack of quality control  i am not_sure i would order from this company again  twisting   twisting   and more twisting  seems like a stable little shelf  just bought it   and will suit the purpose for which it was purchased but it takes longer to_get it screwed in than 15 minutes  my hands kept getting tired from it so_i had to_take breaks  to_get the legs started in each hole was a_bit of a challenge  however  once you accomplished that  you just had to keep twisting and twisting and twisting and twisting  well you get the idea    but i wouldn_t recommend this for heavy things because_it s_not that sturdy i_received the_product and immediately put it together because_i_needed storage  this worked out alright  but i wouldn_t recommend this for heavy things because_it s_not that sturdy  you can bolt it to the wall for added strength but i_didn_t do this yet  as_i just needed to stow away some lighter things and get them out_of the_way  all_in all this cabinet worked well for me  i placed it into a corner so that it was surround by two walls and a dresser  thanks ok for first apt i_bought 2 for 18 00 each shipped from amazon warehouse deals  they re light weight sturdy shelves  not to be used to hold very heavy books  maybe books on half the shelves  i_bought for my sons first apartment  he uses to display his loot crate items  i wouldn_t use these in a room with kids under 12  they re not made for heavy use  it s made of particle board  decent enough for the_price  21 so you would never mistake this for high quality shelves but it s completely acceptable at right at twenty bucks  i_m going_to_use it for seasonal display of my holiday figurines  my was scratched and damaged along the edges   i_used wood markers and my art supplies to  repair  the damage rather than mess with sending it back  its ok for the_price  3 stars means it about what i_expected for the_price  install is very_easy_and fast  there were a_few small chips and scratches on the shelves but not that noticeable  its_not the sturdies shelve  meaning it can wobble a_little  overall for the_price_and for what i_bought it for  its_not bad  
i_bought 2 of these and they were defective  returned those and got more defective items two_stars because_if_i could have put these together they would have been great  i_bought 2 of the 4 tier shelving units and was greatly disappointed  all_of the legs are supposed to have threads so that everything can be screwed together without hassle  4 of the legs did_not have threads and made it so_i could only half way put them together    so_i returned the original ones thinking i would get the right pieces when they shipped me new_ones  nope i_received two new shelves with the_same exact problem  do_not waste your time or money on these because they all seem to be defective  i_don_t know_if anyone else has experienced this issue with these before but for me it was_not worth it  i have returned all four shelves and will not be ordering these again  amazon was really great in this process though and did help me out so_much so_i_do_not blame amazon  i blame furinno for making defective products and not checking everything before they package items up  to be fair 2 stars is too much  im     to be fair 2 stars is too much  im using it to put my watches  wallet  pill containers etc  on it  i_dont know how it got scratched  you can see from the pitures there is no metal or anything could scratch got a heavy 3 d printer  looks and feels super cheap  plastic hollow tubing makes up the rickety supports  i wouldn_t put anything fragile on it  no matter what it weighs  especially unsteady on carpet  spend the_money  cheapskate  i was once just like you  just like yooooooooo    seriously  it s cheaper looking than_i the picture  
disappointed this is the fourth shelf i have purchased from this company  i absolutely love my other 3  however  this_one was_of far worse quality than the_first 3  in my previous orders  the shelves looked the_same all the_way around  on this_one  one side is completely unfinished   see pictures  also  the black tubes had so many shavings inside them  just opening the package made a mess  and a quick shake of each tube left an even bigger mess   see picture  all_in all  the shelves didn_t go together as_well or as easily as my first 3  again  i am 100  satisfied_with those 3  but i_m disappointed that they would allow this_one to be shipped out in the shape that it s in  arrived damaged  chips and cracks  the package arrived_in great_condition but the surprise was when i opened it  3 of the 4 shelf boards had their corners chipped off and cracked  i_decided to ignore it thinking what more could i have expected at this price  the_problem started when i_tried putting it together as the plastic rods refuse to tighten as the shelf holes which apparently should fit snug had cracks as_i_mentioned above  i hope they send me a replacement or refund what i paid  caution read this before buying  right_out_of the_box the toxic smell of this_thing triggered me to have a major asthma attack  buyer beware  toxic overseas plastic and laminate shelving  tubes break during assembly i_bought one_of these to_make a cheap shelf for a_few things that desperately needed it  about a quarter of the tubes  connectors broke into the_other tubes after a_couple_of turns when they were being cautiously and delicately assembled  i_didn_t_even get a chance to screw them tight  even if_i was lucky and all_of the tubes fully connected without breaking  i_d worry that putting any pressure on the shelves would make them snap  i regret my purchase whole heartedly deceptive listing  only holds 15 lbs according to the instructions  not 25  came scuffed and with a chip on it  deceptive listing  says here it supports 25 lbs  the instructions in the manual say it only supports 15 lbs  also came_with scuff marks and a chip  which exposed light tan wood making it noticeable  i suspected before that most of these positive reviews are fake  now_i_m convinced of that  i only bought this because of the_price  so_i wasn_t expecting anything great  but the 1 star is for the deceptive claim that it holds 25 lbs  also what motivated this review   damaged  every single piece damaged  absolutely ridiculous  not  user friendly  packaged arrived ok but it was extremely difficult to put together  the amount of force required to twist the rods into place is crazy hard  i_ve purchased products with this same twist to assemble concept but this_one was by far the_hardest to put together  also the finish is_not that great  the white rods look very plasticky  but i_guess you get what you pay_for  i would not_buy_again or recommend to anyone  do_not_buy       garbage     you get what you pay_for  three out_of the 4 shelves have swells and one has a nick as_well  tried_to call the_company 3 times and can_t get through  the rods are made out_of thin plastic and the shelves are 3 8  pressboard with a vinyl top  save yourself time_and aggravation spend a_little more money and buy_from a different manufacturer  still using it because the_box was thrown out before i_can inspect the components  lucky if_it will hold 10 lbs per shelf  
great shelves   just dont use the drywall anchors they come_with  these are great little shelves  i_m using mine for mini action figures and bobble heads  they hold up just_fine  just dont use the anchors they come_with  i_didnt_even attempt to_use them  i have used better quality drywall anchors on numerous occasions and took one look at these and i instantly knew that i would never use them  just go to home depot or your local hardware store and spend a_few dollars and buy your own  i have included a picture of the_ones i_used  i read a_lot of the bad reviews and it seems that if people used better quality drywall anchors they would not be having the_problems they are having  as far as_instructions  what instructions  there arent any  which i will say is pretty stupid on the_company s part  but a_little brainstorming and you will figure it out  what i_did was decide where i_wanted to hang them  held up the shelf on the wall  then traced the shelves along the outer edges  then i_measured how far down the holes were where the anchor will be inserted and marked it  then you just put the dry wall anchors there  screw to the proper length so that it sits flush and voila    some people said they were using these shelves to hold books and that the shelves were falling off  that s because the supplied anchors are trash  don_t use them  they dont tell you the weight capacity  you need drywall anchors  like the_ones i have attached  that state the weight capacity  the_ones i_purchased are rated to hold up to 50 lbs  good investment great purhase  no_issues installing and so_far so_good with durability  hoping the shelves hold the weight since_i wasn_t able_to find how much weight they re suppose to hold  great shelves  update to my original review  ok  so_i_didnt have the easiest time putting these up because of where they were  around the sink and all   but  i will have to_add that these are actually of great quality  they ve held up  even for all the weight i_ve put on them   they re a_great addition to my bathroom and i honestly couldn_t be happier  they re great_for the_price you pay  i would  however  recommend you get your own wall anchors from the_hardware store or walmart  since_i_ve bought these  i_bought another set for my bedroom and i_got my own anchors from walmart  i picked up screw in anchors that hold up to 30 pounds  a pack of 8 for under  2  and i_gotta tell you  that made all the difference when it came time to put these up  i realized the struggle wasn_t in the instructions or the_way they are  because they even include a_little template for you to_make it really easy  which does help   but the real struggle was the subpar anchors  if you get your own  like i_did  you ll thank yourself  these are great shelves and i_ve been recommending them to everyone  original review  these were alright  not the_best  but not bad for the_money    they were kind of a pain to hang up  even though they did come_with like a template which was somewhat helpful  perfect shelving   perfect shelving    love the look   five_stars the shelves are pretty_good_for the_price  best shelving amazing price  blown away  i_needed some shelving for my home office  i_m on a budget i came across these at this time_i_m posting they were about  16 which got me three different shelves  the instructions were short and pretty simple  only_thing_is they did_not say what size drill bit to_use 11 64in  seemed to_work the_best for me  the_price_is unbelievable i am going_to order at least one or two more sets  incredibly easy_to_install arrived very quickly  incredibly easy_to_install  look so great  exceeded my expectations with quality  seamless installation  but note the dimensions at first i was really hesitant because some reviews said these were tough to put on the wall and that they didn_t hold anything or come_with any instructions  first of all  due to the_way they re hung  kind of like a picture frame is hung   of course they won_t be able_to hold more_than about 8 10 lbs  max  i actually didn_t use the drywall anchor hardware it came_with because_i_didn_t think it would do a_good job  but the screws serve the purpose just_fine  i would recommend just being aware of the exact dimensions of these shelves  because most books and plant pots  for example  will not fit  all three sizes have a depth of roughly 5   but i_love the_way they look and i look forward to having them for a while  and just a note  there  are  instructions with the package  in fact  they also provide a handy piece of paper with a printed guide for the exact distances between screws in the wall  you can screw the paper directly into the wall  gently tear it off  and use it again for the next shelf  haha  i_used a butter knife to_install mine because_i_didn_t have anything else  but_even still  the installation was seamless and easy  the installation was really easy_and all the needed hardware was_included the shelves arrived undamaged and were packaged very_well  the installation was really easy_and all the needed hardware was_included  the instructions were easy_to follow  each shelf came_with its own template  this allowed me to tape each to the wall so_i could figure out location and spacing before i_marked anything or put holes in the wall  the color of the shelves is exactly_as pictured and just what i_wanted  easy_to assemble  sturdy shelves  i_bought these because_i was tired of having all my skincare products and perfumes taking over my vanity area  these shelves were very_easy_to_install due to the fact the set came_with a piece of paper that measued the length of each individual shelf  which made it easy_to_install  not to mention these are very sturdy as_well  i would highly_recommend these and will look to purchase from this brand again  incredible value for these shelves  these shelves are more_than worth the_price  they took less_than five minutes to_install  and you only need a screwdriver and a hammer  all you have to_do is mark the holes and put in your screws  the package comes_with a neat piece of paper that you cut into three strips and it has the spacing premarked so that you tape the strip to the wall as your screw guide  they even provide stickers so you don_t need_to grab tape or anything  many reviews have mentioned that the included instructions don_t make much sense  and i agree with them  you won_t_even need the instructions  so just throw them away  put the screws in your walls and then just slide the floating shelves over the screws and push down a_little to lock them in place  they are sturdy and are working well as extra bathroom storage  i chose these to_go over my toilet because the large shelf is exactly the width of the toilet  so visually  they fit well in the space  they are also truly flush mount and you cant see the screws at_all  i recommend these to anyone  they re worth the_price_and so easy_to_install  overall a_good_product they re worth  15  i_bought them to hold a_couple_of my pops  the_best thing about them is that they are light and hold up well  it must be something about how they hand that make it so_i_didn_t_even need_to screw them into a stud and they feel sturdy  over all i would say it was a_good_purchase perfect  these are exactly what i was looking_for  they were easy_to hang    i_love the included hanging template to_make it easier  they look great  very_nice wall shelves  i_love these  they re just wide enough_to store ultimanias     i_love these  they re just wide enough_to store ultimanias and they sit right above my computer  however  hanging them was an absolute nightmare since there was_nothing_i could do to check a level since they re hung right on screws  i_used a push pin setup  pushed the shelf into the wall with the pins  checked the level  then repeated until it was right  using the hole from the pin to hang my screws  they look great  and i would absolutely buy them again  i_do wish they were a_little wider  but for what i_needed when i_made the_purchase i have no regrets  five_stars very_satisfied elegant and simple perfect_for my crystals  i_measured black sequin fabric and attached it to the shelves so my crystals would have a more friendly surface to lay  they look incredible  these shelves are simple  sturdy  and elegant  i_like the high sides on the ends   they contain the shelf holding area and the items it holds  to an extent  it works_well for my crystals  and the color is so neutral it matches anything  it s a true espresso brown  assembly is a snap  i_didn_t_even look at the instructions  just measure the distance for the holes  mark in desired position and place screws   they include all the screws you need  it says you can use a screw driver but i would suggest a drill  it was much easier  make sure you push down on the shelf once you get it on the screws to secure it in place  this is very important  if you don_t push down on the shelf and secure it it will crash and fall  i learned by doing this exact thing  lol loves it  i_love these floating shells  sets of the decor atmosphere in my family room  just the look that i am looking_for  loves it  great wall shelves but avoid the terrible anchors provided   i_do love the final results of these wall shelves  they are quite small but it is good enough for displaying small figures  they seem pretty sturdy but i_don_t want_to risk putting too much weight onto them  i have a 3 4oz   a 1 7 oz bottle of perfume on the medium one and it is holding on very_well  downside notes  instructions was_not helpful  i was sure if_i_needed a drill but it was definitely a_lot quicker with it  like most people mentioned the anchors provided is terrible  it messes up your walls so_i would say the_best thing_is to_get another set of anchors if not they can damage your walls  it took me around 20 minutes to figure and had them install  easy_to_install  looks great these look fantastic and are very_easy_to_install  they come_with paper strips that help you measure the exact distance between the screw holes for each  which makes it much easier to put the holes in your wall at the exact right position  you want_to screw the screw in like 90  before sliding the shelf over the screw head  if you leave too much space  the shelf will feel wobbly  i_didn_t bother using the plastic grips that you insert into the screw hole  and they still feel very sturdy  highly_recommended    if you thought my review was helpful  it would be awesome if you could click  yes  below  thanks   awesome  i read the_other reviews that the instructions were super confusing    so_i was surprised when i_got to read it for myself    they were very_easy_to understand and use  you just to have common sense   anyways the guide paper that comes_with the instructions were very handy    i wouldve spent an hour trying_to line up the correct lines without it  i_didnt use the drywall stoppers but i_did use the screws it came_with  the shelves itself are very sturdy  i put all my lotions and hair care and stuff like that on them and im not worried about it falling  the shelves are a_bit darker than_i_expected but i_like them dark so_i wasnt mad  very_good_price_for them too    im very impressed    super cute too perfect love them  great_price  and super easy installation  great_value for toy displays  these were ludicrously easy_to_install  find the spot you want_to place them  then slide them slightly to the side of where that is  roughly half the width of the side wings of the shelf  make a vertical notch on the wall with the head of your screwdriver to mark where the screws should be  make another line across the vertical notch to match up where the cutout screw slots on the_back_of the shelves are  if your screwdriver head is just a_bit smaller than the diameter of the screw  just use the head of the screwdriver to_gouge a starter hole in the wall  if your walls aren t too thick  like drywall  just drive your screwdriver into the wall  if you have thick walls  use a drill  always start with a much smaller drillbit than you think you need and then work your way up to a larger size if you need it  insert the anchors in the_driven or drilled hole  and then just tighten the screws into the anchor about 80  of the_way  pop the shelves up onto the screws and you re done  it sounds more involved than_it is  if you don_t have the correct tools for completing this task  your set of household tools is incomplete  don_t try putting anything too heavy on these  maybe  they make great shelves for action figures  model kits  collectibles  or even dvds and blu rays  wonderful shelves to creatively display anything your heart desires  wonderful shelves to creatively display anything your heart desires  these things are beyond aesthetically pleasing  the shelves themselves are quite beautiful  and feel very sturdy  as others have stated  the mounting process can be a_bit of a chore  the anchors they provide are flimsy at best  and the directions definitely leave something to be desired  i wouldn_t take off a star just because of the mounting process  it really isn_t that bad  but if you can manage to weather a_little bit of mounting grief  the shelves will hang firmly in place  and add a beautiful addition to your wall decor  definitely would recommend these shelves for anyone wanting to give their wall a wonderful accent  good  light  simple  they work the small one_is quite small  but they work very_well  for the_price  they are quite sturdy and well put together  the routing for mounting is clean  but not reinforced  so don_t expect to put anything heavy on it  i ended up drilling a hole in the side of the small one and use it for charging my phone by the bed  the medium and large are holding light weight nick nacks above my girlfriend s desk  easy  these arrived_on_time_and as_expected  templates were included that made hanging these an absolute breeze  just use the included stickers to hang the included templates on the wall  drill according to the templates  rip the templates off and install the shelves on the screws  all done_in less_than 20 minutes  which includes using a level to line the templates up_and_everything   pricing seems fair for the_quality   they re not the_best ever  but certainly on par with ikea furniture or something similar  very_pleased  i_purchased and installed these shelves 10 months ago for my baby s room  and after almost a year i_can say i would recommend these to anyone  they ve held up very_well  weren t very difficult to_install  although i would recommend having someone with you to help measure   and they look great  they are exactly what i was looking_for and half what i was hoping to spend  i_m thinking about buying more for other rooms now  instead_of nail  i_use command poster strip to     instead_of nail  i_use command poster strip to keep them in place  and also can be moved around if needed  i intend to_use them for displaying lego  nothing heavy  so_far it works really well  these shelves are handy  attractive  easy_to_install  love these shelves   so easy_to_install  got them up in less_than 15 minutes with a stud finder  drill  and a level  they come_with paper cut outs to tape to the wall so you can pinpoint where to_install the screws  it was super appreciated  i_ve had floating shelves before and they just made it a guessing game to measure and place the screws for them  these were a breath of fresh air  the finish is smooth and chip and scratch free  very appealing  they also fit way more stuff than_i anticipated  totally cleared up my counter space  i should also note  because they fit into studs  i_did_not use the small plastic spacers for the screws  highly_recommended  my perfect solution to a small apartment room love these floating shelves  super easy_to_install  and holds all my little do dads  i currently use the shelves as  1  to hold my tv and fire tv remotes and google home 2  as a small nightstand like thing  which holds my phone  and waterbottle  my bed has a small little dibit in the wall next to it  and this was the perfect solution for a small  table   3  to hold 5  books easy_to_install  thin shelves that helped me clear off my bathroom counter  easily holds bottles and jars of things  i store my makeup bag on one as_well  i_used the template to put it on the wall and didn_t have any issues like others did  i even used the_hardware included and didn_t have any issues  however  i_m not putting anything substantial on them  great shelves  when i found myself running out_of places to put my ever growing funko pop collection i started looking at floating shelves  i_m glad i happened upon these ones  they re perfect_for what i_needed  my pops look really cute on them  hanging above the tv in my living room  normally i loathe hanging things on my wall because_i have a tough time getting them straight level  but the guides that came_with these shelves was a huge help  highly_recommend  i_ll be picking up a second set  and maybe more  for other walls soon  i_m pretty impressed  these shelves are high quality and were     i_m pretty impressed  these shelves are high quality and were very_easy_to_install using the built_in diagrams and instructions  they are sturdy and hold books or assorted random objects well  i would recommend you have a level handy so that you can ensure they are straight as_it can be a_little difficult to guess at  cool shelves easy install great shelves  i spray painted mine and the gold color well  easy_to_install  they came_with these stickers which im sure were to help install the nails straight but i still had to_use a leveler love these  esp  for the_price  ordering more  just received them today and they are already up  they are extremely sturdy and feel heavy duty  listened to other reviews stating not to_use the screws it came_with  purchased a better set at home depot  my teenage daughter s stuff was all over the bathroom  now_it s all neatly on her very own shelves  i plan to order some black ones for her room soon  clean_and tidy  practical space savers very clean_and subtle  i_bought these to help store my lotions and perfumes and to keep them out_of reach from my toddlers  i_m so glad i chose these as they are the perfect size  clean_and tidy looking and don_t take up too much space  they also look very_nice above my white vanity mirror desk  highly_recommend perfect shot glass display i_bought 4 sets of these for shot glasses and a place to put family photos  we automatically bought different anchors than the_ones that come_with it  as far as_instructions  you probably shouldn t be hanging floating shelves if ya need instructions for a task this obvious  we had 7 shelves up_and level in about 20 minutes  it s a_great alternative to expensive shot glass display cases  perfect shelves for any modern home  very modern look and fits perfectly on the wall  holds fairly well at half the_price of an ikea shelf  product comes_with a pilot sheet so you do_not have to guess where to drill the holes  instructions came_in clear as_well  installation_time took 15 minutes with figuring out how to assemble your shelves in your style being the longest  great_buy_for the_price  pros   modern looking shelves fit perfectly on the wall  nice finish and no chips on the_product  product came_within two days cons   none perfect_for the_price  was a_bit sketpical about these but theyre so worth the_price  my only suggestion is do_not waste your time with the_hardware that comes_with the set  screws anchors   buy_from the_hardware and youll be good  the instructions are crap but the pictures pretty much spell it out for you so_its_not difficult  all_in all its a_great bargain  will but buying another set  clean simple lines easy_to put up  perfect_for my use  just the right size to_get vitamins off the counter  i put up with 3m command hooks  with the removable hooks i_can change when ever i wish with no holes to patch  you will have to bend the hook closer together and the shelf will need a spacer at the_back  a hole spacer template is included which is helpful  priced right and a simple sturdy shelf set  awesome shelves these are impressively sturdy  and perfect_for my office space  i have all those cluttery things that clog up a desk up on these shelves instead  stapler  pen cup  etc  the strips included are ingenious  i have never had such an easy time hanging something level   fantastic purchase i was_in the market for some floating shelves for my makeup vanity and purchased these with some hesitation due to previous reviews  i_can say i am blown away by the_quality and ease of installation for these shelves  the drywall screws  the white plastic ones  didn_t do anything for me as_i_don_t have a power drill so_i just hammered the regular screws that were provided into the wall and screwed them in from there  my shelves are stout and the perfect mode for displaying my perfumes and trinkets  i plan on buying several more of these bad boys for the rest of my home  i_love these shelves i_love these shelves  i have them for my room  i_bought them for my boyfriends bathroom  and now_i just bought them for my new baby s room  they aren t as big as they appear in the picture but you can fit a_lot of things on them  i just love the_way they look and they re great_for either storage or decor  i think i_ll get some for my living room next  easy_to hang on the wall too  works for me my original intention was to_use these in my bedroom but i changed my mind  not having a medicine cabinet in my current bathroom and seeing how other buyers used these in their bathrooms convinced me to follow suit  i followed another buyers recommendation to purchase 1 4   8 wall anchors and they went up awesome  can_t really complain about anything  the shelves are in fact shelving  five_stars ordered two  six shelf s total  love them  great quality and value i_bought these during one_of the lightning deals  and they are amazing  i ended up painting the front of them to match my wall which is right next to it  and i think it really tied the whole room together  thinking about getting another set as_well  unlike some other shelves i_ve used  the screws which came_with these are actually sturdy  for the_other shelves on the teal wall  the screws which came_with those literally broke off in the stud haha  we had to_use our own  the good news with these shelves is  the mounting holes are very large  so any screws really will work  love  love love love  a million_times  love  these shelves are exactly what i was looking_for to_get rid of stuff all over my bathroom counter  i_m going_to order like 3 more sets for all over my house   for easy install  mark where the screws sit on the side of the shelves and mark the top of where you want the shelf to sit on the wall and use a leveler  super quick and easy  these work great in my craft room these work great in my craft room  i_used my own wall plugs to_install since the_ones provided were too flimsy  not a big deal  they arrived_in_good time_and look lovely on my wall while being practical  i could see how these shelves would be easy_to move  use new wall plugs   should you ever need_to adjust their placement  i_ve already bought 2 sets and am very_pleased  fantastic shelves  i_needed extra storage space in my bathroom and something to fill up the void space above the toilet  these were the perfect solution  the shelves came_with mounting hardware  drywall anchors  so you can hang them anywhere  as you can_tell from the picture they can hold a significant amount of weight  they re functional  classy and keep everything safe due to the raised sides  i_m so glad i_purchased these  exactly what

marking  did i find the easy  just tape up  drill guides   verified that i_d measured well  thanks  what i_expected and a_little more  this is a pretty sturdy product and very_easy_to_install  it comes_with a paper hole guide and stickers to tack them to the wall  you just find the_best spot for the shelf  find the paper that coordinates with that shelf size  tack it up  and drill your guide holes  i was actually pretty surprised by that added touch and found installation to be extremely quick and painless  i_love my floating shelves i_love my floating shelves    they are made of good quality and easy_to_install  included step by step instructions and included almost everything you need  great_price_for 3 shelves and they match my decor that i was creating  i highly_recommend this_product and my friends are asking where i_purchased it  great little shelves i_bought these shelves from a different seller and never got them  i_liked the_way the shelves looked so_i_decided to order again but through a different seller  i_got the shelves today and i_m very_pleased_with them  i_bought them with the intention of displaying some of my vape gear  they work well for what i_need them for  installation was easy  so long as you toss the instructions  i had an issue getting the last long shelf on the wall  it took me a_good 3 tries  but i_got it to stay eventually  great shelves for my ise i_purchased this for my walls  but its design made me use it in a different way  i have this on the side of one_of my kitchen cabinets  i_need some thing close for small items  it was better then having an end table  love these  love the simple  yet stylish design  easy install  like other reviews  if you plan on putting any significant weight on these  invest in better wall anchors    4  deep but great_for my purposes  love it love it    it s perfect  and easy_to assemble sturdy little shelves  these are great  i_didn_t use the sinkers  and they re just_fine  very sturdy little shelves  they are not super huge  but are perfect_for display and such  i_m using them for display purposes in my bedroom for knick knack type things  i_m using the medium sized one to hold a heavy cast iron tea set  and it holds it no problem  wife loves it  purchased these for my wife about a year or so ago  she loves how convenient and neatly placed they are  they also give us extra shelf space and easy access to the items she uses the most  very_easy_to put up_and take down  
nice shelves but instructions are lacking update  in the attached picture  the hairbrush and watch is attached to the shelve unit by command hooks  they are not included in the shelving unit  these were very_well_packaged  received with no damage and very_fast_shipping time  that said  the installation of these is_not difficult but first thing you need_to_do is throw out the instructions  just make sure you have the 6 screws that came_in the package  if you need_to_use anchors to attach to the wall  throw out the_ones you received and go to a home improvement store and purchase better one  the_ones you receive are cheap and break very_easy  the measurement of each shelve   from inside to inside of side pieces   15 5 8  11 3 4  and 7 3 5  each of these are 4  deep  i put mine up on the wall and put a small line on the wall where i_wanted the top side rail to be at then measured to top of the screw hole  3 4    and put a mark 3 4  down from the small line  used a cordless drill to put the screws in  do_not make them flush to the wall as you will need_to put them in the big hole on the_back_of the shelve then push the shelve down  i put up the longest shelve first then used that for where i_wanted my other ones to be positioned on the wall  i have never installed this type of shelving before but once_i_disregarded the instructions  they went up on the wall pretty quick  i gave it four_stars because of the cheap anchors and the lack of instructions  good shelves  but sub par hardware and unusable directions for the_money  these are good little shelves  the miters are less_than perfect  but they re a_good_value   i feel satisfied in that regard  here s where i had a_problem   the plastic drywall anchors are total garbage  if you drill a hole small enough_to hold them securely  then they ll collapse upon your attempt to insert them  if you drill the hole big enough_to be able_to_install them without damaging them beyond use  then they ll just spin and come loose when you try to screw anything_into them  the_cost of better anchors would  probably  be measured in micro pennies  why they didn_t just include better anchors is a mystery  after making a mess and filling in the original holes and re plotting the whole affair  i grabbed some of my own anchors and screws and_everything went without a hitch  i_used 1 4    8 anchors and screws  see picture   finally  an installation tip   when setting the screws into the anchors  tighten the screw completely  not too tight   about two total rotations after hitting the anchor flange  to draw the plastic flange flush with the wall and  though we can_t see it happening  to spread the_back part of the drywall anchor  then  back the screw out about a quarter inch for final shelf installation  this will enable the shelf to sit flush against the wall  provide additional grab for the anchors  and minimize wobble  the directions that come_with these shelves are pretty awful  and necessitated a_bit of trial and error on my part  i_m not a carpenter  by any means  but i_m not a dope  either  in short   good shelves  but use your own drywall anchors and matching screws  suits my needs  these are small lightweight shelfs that i_used_for my son s room to display his plushies  i was tired of him  storing  them on the floor  they needed a home so_i have been eyeing various shelves on_amazon  saw these  read the reviews and decided to give these a shot  the instructions are pretty self explanatory  i_liked that this kit included paper stencils so you visualize the shelving placement configuration and know where to drill the holes to place the screws for the shelves  the anchors are pretty crappy  one_of them completely broke into the wall when i_went to screw the screw in  luckily i had some anchors on hand and simply replaced it  installation was simple and straightforward  the shelves look very_nice  so_much so_i_ordered a second pair in white that i plan to_install_in my bathroom  i_m very_satisfied_with this_purchase  my son likes his things being out_of the_way and on display as_well  overall great  and look nice overall great  and look nice  and are a_great fit size for funko pop figurines  which is why we went with these in the_first place   the_only real issue i have is that the instructions don_t  far as_i remember  advise you on what size drill to_use in order for the anchors to fit  maybe that s something other people can intuit immediately  but i_can_t  it was a_bit of trial and error  and because of the  soft  quality of the anchors included in the pack  the_first one_i put in the wall ended up mashed in  sticking out  and as a result making the respective shelf tilt forward a_bit  i figured out the right drill size after the_first mishap  otherwise  these are fairly easy_to_install  and we re happy_with them  definitely using better quality anchors if and when we have to move the shelves though  for reinstalling  nice display shelves purchased these shelves for a home office because the finish matched my existing desk perfectly and the_price was right  love the contemporary look of the shelves  the installation packet came_with a template for each shelf to hang the mounting screws which made installation so easy  the_only negative was that one_of the shelves was a_bit scratched up the on underside  not very noticeable and once_i had it hung up you could not tell at_all so_i_did_not bother returning it  i_do wish they have made them reversible for hanging so that you had more options but they look great anyways  fresh finish shelves love these shelves  made our bathroom look great  and also gave us more storage  and gave the bathroom a fresh finished look  i only have to_take on star off because sometimes the screws that were given with the_product did_not fit the holes exactly on the floating shelves  so my husband had to_get different nails to_make it work  all_in all though this is a_great purchase  thank you  great shelves  terrible hardware this is the 4th set i have bought  great shelves  but heads up on hardware  i was able_to_use original hardware before  hanging over doors in laundry room  however today  was putting in a spot where it turns out it hit a stud  prepped as usual  i_ve seen people had trouble with the anchors  but my screw just twisted in half in the stud  soooo  get your own anchors and screws  shelves are beautiful and sturdy  no_issues there look good good shelves  they are made of particle board  which is a_lot better_than plastic  very_easy_to_install  comes_with a template to_make putting on wall easier  i would suggest tossing the wall anchors that come_with them in the trash  go to the_hardware store and get good ones  this will save you a_lot of_time putting them up  i put mine into drywall and they just slipped around  a major headache  i will probably buy these again if_i_need some and a_good pack of wall anchors  great_product but runs small      looks simple and beautiful on wall giving it an expensive look   hanging them was simple n easy which took five minutes as all the necessary hardware is included along with the package   as_i_ordered walnut finish the color contrasts perfectly with the wall giving it an elegant look   the reason for a four star is it s size  which runs small   i excepted them to be much bigger   overall great_product for the_price   simple shelves that can provide character to a bare wall  i_purchased these for a bathroom wall simply to give it a_little character  like many have stated  the dry wall anchors that are provided are very weak  not a big issue but i recommend purchasing different ones  got a pack at wal mart for  2   if what youre placing on the shelves will be very light  you can probably get away their anchors but better to_play it safe  i handled the shelves quite a_bit while installing them and they never chipped or showed signs of tear  when you choosing the height of where you will drill your pilot holes  keep in mind that the shelves will slide down about an inch to lock in place  if_it wasnt for poor quality anchors  it would have been 5_stars  make sure to_use your own hardware  i agree with most reviewers on not using the provided hardware  while the shelving looks great  once_i_used my own screws and ignored the drywall anchors that nearly fell apart getting them out_of the bag  i would have been screwed  pun intended  if_i_didn_t have my own screws  and while i_thought the paper guide with the stickers literally marked  stickers  were goofy it actually ended up coming in handy for measuring out where i_needed to place the screws for each shelf  nice shelves nice shelves for the_price  i_did purchase heavy duty dry wall anchors at lowes for under  2 because the_ones that came_with the shelves seemed cheap  i also added command hooks on the side for my necklaces and hair ties and my bathroom vanity looks so_much better without all that clutter  nice shelves my brother put these shelves up for me  his one complaint  the_hardware that came_with the shelves   useless  was the word he used  he didn_t care for the template  provided  either  i had some extra screws and anchors  so he was able_to_get them up  overall  i_do like them  not perfect but pretty close  these shelves were packaged very_nicely and came very quickly  they aren t  blow your mind  good quality  they lamenent isn_t perfect around some of the coners  however  it s hardly noticible the shelves them selves have a sturdy build  are very_easy_to_install  and are study on the wall  the_only_thing_i noticed and was like  what the heck   was that the shelves  i_got white  seemed dirty  it wasn_t a huge deal  the smudges wiped right off but it was still weird  over all i_m quite pleased and i probably will repurchase  beautiful but bad directions and don_t use the plastic piece    i_love these shelves now that they re up but the instructions and those little white plastic things are terrible  it s nice that they give you paper that has the shelf sizes to screw through  it allowed me to level the paper and then drill in the right spots  nice shelves  good_price  these are cute and inexpensive shelves for small  lightweight items  we bought them to display our miniature lighthouse collection and they work fine for this  i gave the_product only 4 stars because the anchors that came_with the shelves were garbage and i opted to_use my own  shelves are great  the screws are garbage  the shelves are perfect and awesome  and i_love them  however  the screws that came_with them are absolute trash  for force purposes  i_used both a screwdriver and a drill  yet the tips still broke   you re better off buying some quality screws to ensure that they don_t break while trying_to_install these wonderful shelves  nice shelves for the_price  they re nice shelves  installation was easy_and they provide you with measuring guides to_make sure they re straight and aligned properly  however  i think the plastic screw anchors are pretty shoddy and would recommend buying your own  i actually would have preffered them without the upright parts i was looking_for little shelves without the upright parts but once_i_got these  i found out that i could use the space to_add to the_machine age retro look that the little stirling engine on top has  good shelves  a_little difficult to_install nice  as_advertised  really neat 3 set of shelves  i had some difficulty installing but nothing too terrible  i ended up using bigger anchors that worked nicely  currently using the shelves to hold scrapbooking silhouette materials and i_ve had no_problems  
nice 3 shelves for the_price  works with command picture hangers  these shelves are pretty_good  they arrived_on_time  with a_little bit of damage  obviously by the manufacturer  not s h  as they come in a 3 set  wrapped in celephane  or shrink wrap type plastic  surrounded by large air pocket bubble wrap style plastic strips  a_few scratches here and there  and an odd powdery dirt like substance on everything  luckily the scratches are on the underside of the shelves so_its no big deal  you cant see them once hung  i never intended to_use the screw set  so_i_didnt_even look at it  my appt  has a_very strict no damage policy  even to excessive thumbtacks  i saw some rewiews stating these could work_with command hooks  so_i gave them a shot  luckily  they do  only with the large universal picture hangers  silver metal  though  since they hook right into the_back  are easily removable  and are designed to support a_good amount of weight  regular sawtooth holders  poster strips  clips  mini clips ect  just wont support the weight of the shelf alone  let alone anything you desire to place on it  along with the wider hook not fitting into the narrow opening designed for a screw  it can get a_little pricy  as each set of 3 shelves will require 6 hooks  and the hooks only come in packs of 3 hooks pack  if you can_tolerate seeing the excess silver hook at_all times  and cant afford to damage the walls  this is a solid  stylish  and pretty practical option  i ended up getting 3 sets of 3 total  for art supplies  and whatnot  they ve been up for days  and so_far so_good  the screws are straight garbage my fianc insisted i give this a one_star so please know that im being nice  two of the screws broke in my wall  were going_to have to dig them out and patch the wall  so this_product literally damaged my house  only reason im giving it a 3 instead_of a 1 is because_i read reviews saying not to_use the screws provided and still did it anyway  so that part is my fault  but still  the damage is done and its really inexcusable_to be selling the shelves with screws the the_seller  knows  are garbage  theyve had more_than enough reviews telling them so and havent swapped them  so learn from my mistake and buy your own screws  or get different shelves  easy return so_it might be worth a shot if     i returned this without_even removing them from the_box  they appeared to be well constructed and were in the size range that i_needed  but the wood of the shelf and the plastic trim on the pressboard edge were two different white tones  the edge was a more blue white while the shelf was a more eggshell  it may work in some environments  or with different lighting   we use soft lighting in the 2700k range   but it caught my eye in a way i couldn_t stand  easy return so_it might be worth a shot if you love them  pretty shelving solution love the look of these  they are sturdy enough for my purposes  only issue is the sheetrock anchors that ship with them are useless  ended up using my own higher quality  shame for the_company to skimp on such an important aspect of the design  would order again and recommend them  i_wanted to love these shelves so_much i_wanted to love these shelves so_much  when i read the dimensions  i_must ve read them wrong because these shelves are tiny  they also cannot hold much weight  i have them mounted above my art desk to hold my paints  they are sturdy enough_to hold them and not move  but i wouldn_t trust them to hold anything fragile  overall a_good_product  i_bought these thinking they would be     overall a_good_product  i_bought these thinking they would be able_to hold books and folders  they aren t quite wide enough_to_do so  i found some uses for these in my bathroom to hold some items  the drywall anchors would be better if they had a lip on them so that they do_not go too deep into the wall  not a bad product for the_price though  would recommend if you need something_inexpensive to hold some smaller items  listen to reviews i_didnt im giving this 3 stars for the shelves themselves  however  the mollies were horrible and un usablewe had to_get better ones  the screws also broke in half as we were putting them in so they were cheap   so_if you buy this go out and buy better screws and mollies  or just buy higher rated u shelves with better reviews  floating over my head very attractive but not as deep as_i_thought they would be  that s on me for not reading the dimensions properly  they were kind of a hassle to hang  but i_m not at_all handy  and i ended up using at least one as a fashionable book holder of sorts on top of another surface in my apartment  they are nice for holding n64 cartridges if you have some around  meh  i_got what i paid for  i_m kind of  meh  about the shelves  i basically got what i paid for  cheap shelves  don_t get me wrong  i_m still going_to_use them  i_bought them for our guest bathroom  mostly just to put a_few knickknacks on  i think once they re up they ll serve their intended purpose  however  i_m not 100  sure that the shelves will actually stay on the wall  the anchors they came_with are literal garbage  save yourself a headache  throw them out and go buy better ones  and maybe some brackets to keep the shelves stable  too narrow for much use these are decent quality for the_price_and are easy_to_install  they come_with a paper that has the screw hole distances pre measured for you  however  they are incredibly narrow  i_bought them to_replace a broken bookshelf for my son and they are so narrow they do_not_even fit chapter books  i really don_t know what they might hold beyond keys or trinkets    they don_t_even hold dvd s  i would not trust these shelves to hold anything fragile  either  as they are not 100  stable when installed  they stay on the wall but jiggle if touched  it s okay not very sturdy  the large one broke 3 minutes after i put it up  i_decided to_use my own nails and techniques instead_of the_ones given  and they hold up a_lot better now  not the_best quality  but works 
for such a_great_price  i should have known that the_quality     i_bought ewei s 3 floating u shelves in both the white and espresso finish because_i_wanted to decorate my living room and bedroom  for such a_great_price  i should have known that the_quality would be compromised  the_seller advertises that the shelves come_with all_of the necessary hardware and are  easy_to hang   boy  is this the overstatement of the century  the plastic drywall anchors are cheaper than dirt  and frankly work just as_well  the anchors don_t have a cap  they re flimsy  and i certainly don_t trust them to hold up a shelf  of the 6 total drywall anchors  3 broke completely and two fell behind the wall  these are trash  i_decided to_play it safe and buy my own drywall anchors from ace hardware to hang the shelves  i would highly_recommend that anyone who buys these shelves does the_same  it s disappointing that ewei would overlook such a critical component of their product to maximize profits  if you re looking_for convenience  buy another company s shelves because anything_is better_than the_hardware that ewei provides  the shelves themselves are great  but they are a_little bit smaller than_i_expected them to be  smaller than they appear pictures give a misleading idea on size  these shelves don_t have much depth  make sure to check out the dimensions description closely prior to_buying  if you need three tiny shelves  these seem to be nice otherwise  small way too small for kids books i_can only fit the really small ones on there  also seems very cheaply made  might be good_for dvds kind of flimsy not the easiest to_install  the_hardware is a_bit on the cheap side  the shelves can_t carry too much weight either  i was really looking_forward to these shelves  but when it came it it looked as_it had been previously installed used  i returned them and am looking_for different floating shelves  
don_t waste your time    absolute garbage   i should have listened to my gut  i usually don_t leave reviews but want_to save people the hassle i had  instructions   piss poor  mounting hardwear   piss poor  quality of the_product   piss poor  shelves arrived with no padding between the 3   they are all just nested together in a box so two of them were scratched  as others have said   the mounting harware is complete crap so_i_bought my own better anchors  then after measuring and drilling and attempting to mount  the slot where the screw slides down to lock it in place blew out on one side because they re made of press board garbage  i_guess you get what you pay_for     i wouldn_t waste my time_if_i was you  these are going back asap  right after i fill and paint the holes i had to drill in my wall to place them      half baked instructions  missing screw and terrible screw anchors this_product deserves 0 starts  the instructions dont tell you what drill size to_use  so you have to guess    is it 7 32 or 13 64  well  if you try 7 32 drill you will not be able_to put the screw anchors in  they will just bend and break  if you use 13 64 the screw anchors will just fall through the dry wall or come out  i expect these shelves to fall_off the wall within a_month  do_not_buy  i_can_t keep anything on these shelves except for useless tiny nick knacks these are extremely narrow  i_thought that 3 inches was something at least  but it s_nothing   i_can_t keep anything on these shelves except for useless tiny nick knacks  however if that s your thing  go for it  screw heads all broke off  the screw heads all broke off and now_i have jagged metal stuck in my walls  dangerous  so someone has to come fix this now  i_m pissed  do_not use any hardware that comes_with these  it s total garbage  bought this based on all_of the good reviews  and was really excited about them especially     bought this based on all_of the good reviews  and was really excited about them especially the_price  however  impossible to hang on walls  actually created huge holes in the wall  had to_return  spend the extra money and get the wood ones  poor quality  not worth the    these shelves are very poor quality  i hung them in our bathroom to help keep our counters clear  we only used them for light bottles and hygiene care such as lotions  glasses  contact solution  deodorant etc  after only a_week  the shelves tore through the screws and fell from the wall  each time we attempted to re hang them  they tore worse  i_do_not recommend these shelves  this was a horrible experience  the dry wall anchors did_not_work     this was a horrible experience  the dry wall anchors did_not_work at_all  3 of the 6 included anchors just bent while following the limited instructions  now_i have to_go out and buy additional anchors just to finish the job  
great small shelves for  20 bucks  i just finished building and installing it on the wall  it took about an hour  a long hour  but it came out very_nice  all i_needed was a phillips screw driver  first off  some of the reviews are wrong  the screw color does_not matter because_included are colored plugs that fit over the screws and hid them  even the_product photo is missing these plugs that hid the screws  maybe it s a product update or something but it works for me  second  people are saying these boards bend  they do_not bend at_all  i think they are trying_to build it while attached to the wall  that is just dumb  you build it on a table or ground    then you attach it to the wall with 3 screws  note  these shelves will not hold considerable weight    it s only 3 screws holding it up after all  lastly  the shelves are very small  only about 7 5 inches tall each  each shelve length has a 7 inch radius    so not much  for a cheap  small  wall mounted corner shelves  this is the_best deal  i_m very_happy_with this_purchase  work great in my daughters room i was really excited to come across these shelves for my daughter  i had bought some other shelves for my bathroom and my daughter was distraught because she thought they would be for her  i had promised the next shelving i_bought to_go in her room  i_loved the idea of a corner shelving unit  i_thought it would be unique and perfect_for her to show off gymnastics trophies and such  i_know shelves are shelves but honestly  these turned out fantastic for her  so  what is in the_box  each shelf or piece was packaged securely in a box with padding for protection  i was_impressed that the_unit arrived_in pristine condition  it included everything_i_needed including hardware and instructions  i will be honest that it looked challenging to put together but i had it done_in about thirty minutes  the instructions were pretty clear  all_of the panels are letter labeled making it really easy_to_install if you followed the directions  the_only hiccup i had was figuring out that the three bigger screws went into three panels evenly spaced into the wall  it isnt rocket science so by looking at the diagrams i figured it out  they include anchors in case you are not installing on a stud and need added support  this installed quickly_and looks really good  for simple shelving that doesnt break the piggy bank these are perfect  it_even included little screw covers to match the shelves  i am super impressed and my daughter loves them  had all the parts and was packed nicely  i was_impressed with the look once_it     it came quickly  had all the parts and was packed nicely  i was_impressed with the look once_it was on installed  installation was easy but requires two people in order to accurately mark where it s going_to be screwed into the wall  once_i put it together it was kind of wobbly but once_it was_installed in the wall it was sturdier than_i_thought it would be  i should have paid more attention to the height of the shelves  as you definitely can_t put a 5x7 frame on this but possibly a 4x6  that was my miss though  i would recommend this and buy it again  so easy_and great quality for the_price  i_love it  so easy_to_install  under an hour and i_m a woman  i_got this for my bedroom because_i have small items such as hair clip  glasses and even lotions  i_m going_to_get another_one for the_other corner  i_m happy today because of this  it s going_to be a_good day regardless  this is really pretty once_it s installed this is really pretty once_it s installed  the instructions that come_with this_unit are a_bit confusing   it s just a diagram  no explanation  we realized that it didn_t need_to be put together  it just needed to be mounted on the wall piece by piece  once we figured that out  it was fairly easy_to_install  it sure make a ratty looking corner look so_much nicer  for the_price_it was worth the initial install drama  want a beautiful shelf to_make any room stand out  look no further  i recently started working from home and wanted to_make my home office feel more homey  so_i started to_add photo frames and shelves for storing my items  i came across this shelf and it really caught my wifes eye  she told me to_buy it right away  so that it would come in just in time as we were finished renovating the home office  the item arrived super fast   2 day guarantee  shipping  awesome  upon opening the item  i was_impressed with how small_of a box everything was packed in  we went ahead and opened the_box to find the shelves neatly packed and nicely labeled by letter for ease of assembly  between the two of us we had the shelf put together and on the wall within 33 minutes  we timed it  and our power tools are our best friends  the build quality is amazing  nice_and durable  included screws and couplings for securing the screws into the drywall  overall  i am pleased_with the item and the outcome  i will be sure to update this review if any problems concerns arise  thank you for taking the_time to read my review  irwin tools 4935639 black oxide hex shank drill bit  3 16 inch   used to drill the holes in the wall for the couplings hyperikon cordless power drill lithium 12v with driver set and project kit  3 8 keyless chuck   drill used stanley 68 012m all_in one 6 way screwdriver   to manually screw the screw s provided five_stars looks very_nice  and easy_to assemble  perfect_for displaying  exactly what a weeb like me wanted i absolutely love it  it s exactly what i_wanted  even if my wall_in the apartment is slanted it still fit perfectly  i_m currently using it as my shelf for games  but i_m planning on buying another to display manga  the_price was very reasonable_too  i had no_complaints  my favorite part about it is the finish and durability  i_know_i_dropped a piece myself on accident and no scratches  it arrived_on_time_and in perfect condition  10 10 would buy_again  but like when i_move out because_i have no room left in my room  ironic  i_love it  just starting to redocrate and i get compliments on this shelf all the_time  i_love it  perfect fit  size  and color for a home office half bath having just remodeled my home office bathroom which included getting rid of one_of those tall plastic double door cheap storage cabinets  i opted for a southwest color scheme of cabinets  a mojave sand wall color  mojave corian counter tops and a dark distressed looking barnwood flooring  with the cabinet gone  that whole corner exploded with emptiness  i saw this corner piece here on_amazon and took a flyer on it as being the_one   it was  fairly easy_to put together however pay close attention to alpha id system  it looks inutitive but then it becomes a rubix cube if you mess up one piece connection  i get a_lot of compliments from guests abut the bathroom  not bad decorating for a guy  dontcha think  good shelves  but modifications needed to_make symmetric  with slight modification you can get two shelves to be symmetric  otherwise they ll look like the_one on the left     read review    would recommend to anyone  great shelving  awesome design and shelving idea  easy installation  recommended tools  pencil pen  impact drill drill driver  hammer  phillips bit for drill  and 3 16  drill bit   very sturdy and clean look  i will say i wish they had a bigger size  shelving is rather shallow  i couldn_t use it for my original idea to put my wedding frames  pictures and memorabilia on for my wife because the shelves weren t deep enough or tall enough between the shelves to hold the 57 potrait frames with the stands  but  we reporposed it and used it for a nic nac shelf in our eat in area off our kitchen  very_good_product  will hold the weight of anything you could fit on it and then some  after installation i grabbed the top board that is mounted flush to the wall and hung on it  175lbs   hopefully this will help you with your decision on purchase  beautiful design arrived_on_time  the wall mount looks beautiful in the living room shelf space  the distance between each shelf is small so you can only keep smaller display items  which is okay as_i_needed something similar  the screws are covered with caps which makes the display even better without any screws popping up in the view  i_used sugru to bond the top and the bottom shelf to the wall_instead_of using screws or nails as_it helps in keeping the esthetics of the wall as_is  five plus stars  five plus stars  absolutely loved this shelf  it took a while to figure out which plate goes where as the instructions and markings on the shelf itself werent great but then i could live with it as_it gave me this awesome look to my living room  i have quite somethings on it as you see and its very sturdy  nice  put together before mounting    i really like these shelves  they don_t hold a_lot but the design is great_and it holds just enough of my things such as a jewelry box  a blue tooth speaker and a_couple_of other knick knacks  like other reviewers have said  put it together before you mount it or you will have hell trying_to put it together on the wall  i would buy another_one easily  great_for my daughter s knick knacks  this was great_for my daughter s room  she wanted a place to put her tiny gems  knick knacks  blind bag treasures  etc  i_didn_t want anything to_take up space in her room so this was a perfect use of wasted space  off in a corner  but high enough that she could still have a doll house or something beneath it  she loves changing her stuff on the shelves and making them different  nice wall mou t nice wall mount for the_money  when putting it together  i recommend doing it on it s side because_it starts to_get a_little flimsy the more you add on layers  oh make sure you pay attention to holes in middle for wall mounting so you don_t have to undo it all  looks nice_and great_price  arrived_on_time  it s a_great addition to our livingroom a total pain in the butt to put together  but if you pay close attention to each piece it won_t be that difficult  that is no fault of the instructions  it was me being impatient to_get it on the wall  otherwise haven_t had any issues_with it  it s a_great addition to our livingroom  everyone_is complaining about the size       but it clearly states the sizing if you read through the description and through q as  yes  the drywall anchors are rubbish  but nothing a trip into my garage  or a hardware store  couldn_t fix if you re going into drywall  as_i_did   overall  i think it s a_very decent shelving unit for the_price  i_purchased two  white for the bathroom and walnut for an odd corner in the hallway  i also purchased some cheap acrylic paint at the local craft store to cover the screw heads  with amazing results  versus the screw caps provided in the kit   best corner space we had mounted these shelves in the left corner of the foryer and it is perfect_for grad and go items we keep forgetting  also  vintage breakables are displayed in top shelves where grandkids cannot reach  my daughter liked these so_much that i_purchased one for her and she uses it in her bathroom to store her essential oils   up high away from toddlers  corner shelves   me likey these shelves hold things and they go on your corner which is spaciously convent  and people stare at them  what more could you want  i should also add that i have no skill at_all with setting things up_and i was able_to_set this up  it comes_with holes in the wood already so you just need a screwdriver and you put it together beforehand and then you only need_to drill three holes into your wall with a drill  so that was nice  five_stars fits perfect in corner  worked out great_for minecraft idea  easy assembly  love   i_needed something_in the corner of my bedroom so_i saw this and fell in love  i had my husband assemble it  which he said was tedious and annoying  strange coming from someone who decided burnt turd was a_good name for our shared amazon account   it didnt seem very difficult    all_in all im im happy_with the size  so happy i found something to fit that empty space  and for such a reasonable price too  very_happy_with it nice quality and very_easy_to instal     i_got mine on sale   very_happy_with it nice quality and very_easy_to instal one word 5 star     happy_with this_purchase  it looks good with my light gray wall and serves its purpose  it was pretty easy_to put together and install even though the anchors it came_with weren t great  it wasn_t a big deal to me especially for its price  highly_recommended  perfect  this shelf was so easy_to hang up_and put together  you may need two people  because_im short and almost needed help but i_managed  love the color  its pretty true to the advertisement  and the wood seems pretty sturdy  i would buy it again  and i would definitely recommend this shelf  its cute  fun  and gives the wall something more to look at then just a normal shelf  perfect    i have a mermaid nautical inspired room and these shelves added so_much for me  very_easy_to build and anchor into the wall  3 screws   as you can see  it holds quite a_bit  hope this helps  i adore the shelves  exaclty as_in picture  looks great  very_easy_to_install and it looks great  i have traveled quite a_bit lately and got this to display the souvenirs  it worked out perfectly  it is exactly_as shown in the picture  adorable perfect shelves with a_little bit of personality  i_didn_t realize there were two different size screws and accidentally put the long ones in the shelves instead_of in the wall  but we had more of the big screws in the garage so_it wasn_t a big deal  highly_recommended  im not they can print things together but this was very_easy  the directions were so easy  after putting it together its still looked like a_nice shelf  adds a_lot to my home and im glad i_purchased  i_love when i have great amazon purchases   very modern and sleek looking this corner wall mount shelf is great  it looks wonderful mounted to the wall  we have a small house and not much room to put pictures of the grandkids when we get them  mounting this in the corner allowed me to be able_to display those great pictures  there are 5 shelves and  though each shelf isn_t real big  they are big enough_to place a 5 x 7 framed picture on each shelf  very modern and clean looking  would definitely buy another_one_if_i_needed it  nice shelving on my wall looks beautiful on my bedroom wall  putting it together had me frustrated at first  especially putting the lower shelves on  i ended up putting it together in units  one back piece  one shelf  them assembled it from there  much easier  but well_worth any frustrations  i looks great  cute and perfect_for small corner i_needed some shelves in my nursery to be  i have 2 small corners near 2 closets and this is a perfect fit  i_m actually about to order a second for the_other closet corner  ignore the paint  it s a work in progress and my husband doesn_t want_to cut in around it in a_few weeks  just follow the instrutions   you ll be fine  it arrive 4 days after i_bought it  all_of the pieces and instructions where there but they where dusty and one shelf piece was a_little cracked    but it was pretty easy_to build   i am 5 1 and not handy at_all but i built it alone and in under 30 minutes    works  this is a pretty_good solution to a small spot that needs some storage space  we are using it in our half bath  and it works_great to hold our son s stuff in there  the instructions could have been a_bit better  but i figured it out  nice little corner shelf  i am so pleased_with this_purchase  all pieces came shipped in a small box with directions inside  directions are pictures  but easy_to follow since all pieces are labeled with letters  it took about 20 minutes to assemble  just screwing pieces together  and about 5 minutes to hang  i_did this by myself  easy  so only one person is needed  check the measurements because_it is_not very wide   i_measured my wall space before purchasing and it fit perfectly  screw covers were included with my shelf  all pieces arrived_in_good_condition  very_happy and would purchase again  these tiered wall mount work wonderfully on our small bedroom and they are very trendy     these tiered wall mount work wonderfully on our small bedroom and they are very trendy and look great  dont expect to put too much on them  the shelf is decorative mainly  small knick knacks work great  great wedding gift for a decorator  i_got this_as a wedding gift for my sister and brother in law and they love it  my sister loves to decorate so she has stuck all sorts of fun things on it it looks amazing  it was easy_to put up_and although they said they can_t stick anything heavy on it  they love it  cheap but awesome  i have 6 of these  they work well enough_to display my huge and heavy agates  i really like how they look  its hard to find good corner shelving solutions  and this is perfect  also  if youre willing to put in a_little more custom work  you can assemble them to mirror eachother on the_same wall  if you dont  the pattern they make wont match  as_in  the solid panels will be on opposite walls  not_sure how else to explain it  five_stars nice little shelf  cant fit anything too tall on it but looks nice for trophys and books  
four_stars serves it purpose as an rta corner shelf awesome the shelves were very_easy_to assemble  i highly_recommend this_product to anyone who needs a_little splash of decoration in their home  please note  each shelf is about 8 inches  looks great in my son s room looks great in my son s room  my one annoyance is that i wish they included white caps to place over the screw holes  otherwise  it is very pretty and sturdy  hard to complain for the_price  it s hard to complain too much for the_price  it s veneer on mdf board  the boards themselves are not horrible but the_hardware is  so do yourself a favor and toss it  there s a_couple problems  but overall it s fine for nicknacks  first the holes for the screws are drilled as deep as the screws so_it s very_easy_to strip them before they get tight  this is easy_to fix if you use new screws that are another 1 4 1 2  longer so they have more bite  since_it s a veneer using wood glue to attempt to_make it more secure doesn_t_work as the glue doesn_t stick to the veneer  also make sure you pay attention to the square pieces only one side has a veneer on it  so you want_to_make sure that s the side showing when assembling  the mounting hardware is pretty cheap  best to_use some better in wall fasteners unless you get lucky in your corner and hit a stud on both sides  the_other thing_i would say is it s_not tiny  but it s_not nearly as big as the_product photo would have you believe  anything larger than about 6  in any dimension is probably not going_to fit  i_d put this in the category of disposable functional furniture  it s very cheap  it looks pretty nice  and will probably last for years as long as you don_t put anything really heavy on it or abuse it  however  i wouldn_t expect it to survive a move or any abuse unless you disassembled it  and even then the mdf might not hold screws the second assembly  it s a_nice piece for the  24  if_it was  50 i_d say it was way overpriced  cool idea we are not the most handy people so_it took us a_bit to assemble the self and then hang it  the_only instructions that you receive are on the side of the_box so that didn_t help much  the screws that are included are a shinny brass that really stand out on the dark wood  so_i took a black marker and colored them in they look much better now  overall very_happy_with this item and quick delivery  art deco on the cheap 2 stars for the cheap build quality  complete with screw holes that easily strip out  3 stars for the somewhat cheesy finish  i think walnut version of these shelves match the interior of an old cheap trailer house exactly  5_stars for the better_than average assembly instructions  especially in this day and age  5_stars for the stylish yet simplistic art deco design  i want_to live in 70 s era california instead  these shelves are perfect solution both on behalf of design and space as_i_don_t have enough space in my bedroom for night table  these shelves are perfect solution both on behalf of design and space  it was so easy_to_install them  everything you need is included in the package  you will only need drill and level  i specially loved design  white color suits everything and perfect addition to any style  if need something nice  useful  easy_to_install and stylish  these are your shelves  not 100  90 s the_one_i_received  the corners are not 100  90 s  it only comes_with 3 support screws  i set this up for my wife and knowing she will load it up with all kinds of items  so_i added 3 bigger support screws and anchors  they are not hidden like the_ones that come_with it  but i_know_it won_t fall  and i_know she can put anything on there that will fit now  my wife loves it  would give it five if_it meshed in the coners better  nice look  not good_for things that would need_to be plugged in easy_to put together  took me less_than 15 minutes  though i_did use a power drill  i imagine it d take twice that time hand screwing 23 screws  looks nice  shelves do_not have much space in between as other reviewers have said but it s great_for some small stuffed animals and a_few other nicknacks unfortunately  it s really useless for anything that needs to be plugged in  i intended to put the baby monitor on the shelving but there is no where for the cord to_go  overall a_good quality product for the_price overall a_good quality product for the_price  the directions were not as clear as_i would ve liked them to be but thankfully i have a handy fianc  one_of the pieces were supposed to have holes drilled in both sides but only had holes on the_one side  again  my handy fianc was able_to rectify that situation and we were able_to put it together and hang it in about 30 minutes  the wood doesn_t split like it does on some of the cheaper stuff which was nice since we had to modify one_of the pieces  it s extremely sturdy once mounted  takes time but is worth the buy the_product comes_with the individual shelf pieces  the screws and plastic anchors  i recommend buying your own anchors  or toggle bolts  because the_ones given are pretty cheap and didnt expand well enough in the wall to support the shelves  you have to screw each shelf into the_other  and to_do so you need a small phillips screwdriver  i recommend a small one because_its harder to_do so with a larger one as_it wont fit between the shelves  when all put together and hung  it looks great  decent corner shelves for the_price hey are good enough for the_price  these are particle boards  so not super strong  good to put some toys and a_few kids books  nothing too heavy  the color is more towards the darker brown   almost black  although curved  the flat edges are sharp  i will have to put some soft baby proofing once my kid starts crawling   walking  the wall screws and drywall plugs are a joke  dont recommend using them  i could just pull out the entire shelf  i_got better ones from a local hardware thats rated for 50lb capacity each  this_thing_isnt moving anywhere now  love these shelves love these shelves  a_little bit of a pain to put together  i ha to_use my own anchors in the wall  the_ones that came_with it weren t that great  likewise  make sure to_use a level to_make sure your walls are perfectly even  my walls have plaster on them and are slightly uneven so the top of this comes off the corner a_few mm  in no way am i_deducting points for my walls  pretty detailed  but you still need_to_use some     product was as_expected except for a_few things  the reviews i read complained about the instructions and the exposed screw heads  the manufacturer obviously listened because_it now has_instructions inside the_box  rather than just on the_box  pretty detailed  but you still need_to_use some common sense  they also_include plastic caps to cover the screw heads  does a_nice job  color and size was as_expected  the wall mollys included are garbage  use some of your own  its worth the trouble  great idea  needs a_little better screw slots great idea  needs a_little better screw slots  putting this together was easy but there was one piece that the screws seemed to slide in too easy_and in turn made the shelf not very secure wobbly   i_used a third screw to_make it more secure  it works for what i_need nice shelves these shelves were relatively easy_to put together once_i_got the hang of it  there were some snags when i_made it about half way as my drill could not get in at the right angle  i found that putting the shelves together in 3 parts and then connecting the parts together made for a better situation  the package came_with everything that i_needed and it took me about a half hour to_make the entire shelf and mount it  has a zig zag look and although the shelves are small they  being 5  held all my perfume bottle just wonderful  ver nice i_like it although it was packed in a box and then bubble wrap the corner of one shelve was damaged but with a_little glue and placing it on the top did_not affect the look  has a zig zag look and although the shelves are small they  being 5  held all my perfume bottle just wonderful  ver nice i_like it  perfect_for kids room  i_love this shelf  one tier had a portion peeled off but my decorations covered that  the_only difficult part was placing in the corner  one wall i hit concrete  had to_get special drill bit  concrete nail and anchors  that meant a trip to the store  the_other wall  i_used a sturdier drywall anchor with 1 nail it came_with  i place it in my daughters room and placed some of her beanie boos for display  now stuck finding another way to display the rest of her collection  i_managed to fit 20 beanies on the shelf  nice  sturdy shelf i_purchased one for a living room  i_liked it so_much that i_bought another for my son s room and had decided to_buy one more to round out the crib wall  packaged well  shipped in excellent condition  the screws that come_with it are okay  but my husband used his own on the second shelf  i_can fit 5x7 sized frames on the shelves very_nicely  and though i have not hung anything with any weight to it  i would feel confident putting heavy objects on it  if you can screw it into the corner studs  this is an_excellent shelf  especially for the_price point  i_made it four_stars due to the_hardware  and the pieces do_not match perfectly but enough that once_it is hung is unnoticeable  i wouldn_t purchase this for books  i_like it  it s different  i really like this shelf  its different  easy_to assemble if you follow the directions  most of the reviews said you need 2 people to_install it  i_did it by myself and i hate putting stuff together  lol  all_in all  i am very_well pleased_with my shelf  for the_price this shelf is nice  we are using it in our little girls     the instructions were very hard to follow as they are limited with the information they tell you  you will want a short screw driver  there is_not a_lot of room in between shelves for a long screw driver  my shelf had black hand and finger prints all over it but i_managed to wipe them off  for the_price this shelf is nice  we are using it in our little girls nursery to put keepsakes on  it took me about 20 minutes to assemble all by myself    we live in an older house so this could be     we live in an older house so this could be why but   some parts weren t completely flush with the walls  and  it didn_t hold as much as_i_expected  i was hoping to_use this for some of my books   still really handy  and i have two of them  not the_best quality but it s worth the  20 not the_best quality but it s worth the  20  there was one little chip in one_of the pieces but it s_not noticeable because of where it is  very_easy_to put together  i wouldn_t trust putting anything too heavy on it  i_m using it for dcor in my daughter s nursery and it s perfect  very cute  would recommend  decent for  20 works pretty darn well   i just wish it was made of actual wood instead_of particle board   tis my only complaint  ill probably replace it in the future with an actual wood corner shelf made from someone_off etsy eventually  but for now this works  definitely glad i_bought this shelf definitely glad i_bought this shelf  very_easy_to assemble  just make sure your wall screws are aligned with a pencil mark you will have to hold it and maneuver to_get it right probably easier with two people but definitely still some what easy by yourself  nice_and appears to be a float shelf  love it  4 stars due to it made me work up a sweat lol a_nice addition to the room the shelves came well_packaged with very_easy instructions  however i wasn_t impressed with the anchors that came_with the shelving  i_decided to purchase a more heavier duty anchor and install the shelves with these  only looks good from afar  but it s solid the_quality on the finish isn_t the_best  but it is a_great display if you put it in a corner where you can_t see it from up close  the wood like material holds up rather well_and setup  aka  putting it together and on the wall  was a breeze  
it looks good overall but    this shelf looks decent on the wall  but there was a real battle for me to enjoy it  the_quality seems mediocre  and the pieces don_t match up exactly no matter how hard i_tried  from anywhere other_than directly next to it  it looks nice  admittedly  and i_did receive a compliment on the style from a visitor  now to the nitty gritty  1  the instructions are pretty loose  they are on the_box  so for goodness sake don_t throw it out or tear it   i included a picture  there are no words  just a picture with the letters on it  it doesn_t say if you should assemble pieces before mounting or just put it right to the wall so_i_ll tell you  assemble first  a drill doesn_t fit in the spaces once_it starts going_together  2  the spaces are smaller than_i imagined  i have various sized books and none_of them can sit upright except my son s antique childrens stories  so don_t get it to actually use as a bookshelf  it wont do  3  i_love the color and the mock wood looks very_nice  however  as you can see in the pictures  theres no stickers or anything to_go on top of the screw holes  so theres just big shiny screws all over this dark nice wood look  overall i_like it  but i_don_t love it  it isn_t a bad price  but just know what youre actually getting  i_received this at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of the_product  use your own wall anchors i_bought this for more storage in our guest bedroom  putting the shelf itself together was pretty straightforward  even though the instructions were only one page long  the pieces were all labeled well so_it was easy_to follow  however  the wall anchors that came_with the kit were awful  they kept sinking into the wall when we tried_to put the screw in  plus when one wall anchor failed  you would have to unscrew all the_others and start over  which took up time  my suggestion is to_go out and get your own large wall anchors to_use  it will save you some trouble  but obviously the end result looks great  hence the three_stars  they look great  but the_quality is_not all there  these seem amazing in the photo  but upon further inspection when receiving it i realized the_quality of the design was_not excellent  first  the screws are covered by poorly fitted plastic covers that blend with the shelf color  then i realized that either my wall corner was seriously off kilter or the shelves did_not perform to expectations  this looks great in my living room i_use it for some     this looks great in my living room i_use it for some video game related collectable and i_love how it looks and holds everything on it  however i will recommend you get proper wall anchor for dry wall as the included will not hold a paper clip to the wall  i_must say while i_love the shelf the lowest most part came damaged for me in that i could not screw it togeather and it was loose and almost completly broke durring assembly  outside of that this_thing looks amazing holds up well_and its really just a_nice product  easy_to assemble but came_with scratches was super easy_to put together and looks great on my wall  only_thing_i_m a_bit bummed out over is the amount of small scuff marks and scratches that were on each piece right_out_of the_box  structurally it seems great_and i_got all the pieces i_needed to secure it to my wall  for  20 though i would have liked less scratches  i_can see from other reviews that others have had a similar experience  overall i_m happy_with it but probably wouldn_t buy_again  nice  but use different hardware to hang this shelf is ok  i_ve purchased others that were sturdier then this model  i_don_t recommend using the_hardware they provide to hang it  i_used mollies i_purchased from home depot  it does look nice after getting it hung up_and is doing the job i_purchased it for  holding books and such in my home office  even though once_it was put up it looked good  took forever to assemble and the instructions were     extreme pain in the ass to put up  definitely would not purchase again  even though once_it was put up it looked good  took forever to assemble and the instructions were extremely vague  looks great  just a_little flimsy while putting it for the_money it s decent  the screws wouldn_t grab onto one_of the holes so_i had shove some toothpicks and wood glue into it to give the screw something to hold onto  once attached to the wall its ok  looks great  just a_little flimsy while putting it together i_don_t love this  i barely like it i_don_t love this  i barely like it  i_thought it would be great_for a tiny statement piece in the random corner above the bed  it was easy enough_to assemble based on the instructions  it is far too flimsy unstable_to trust above me sleeping at night  i talking about the 5 tier  i should have gotten the smaller version  the mounting hardware is ridiculous and i ended up with a small hole in my wall and no corner shelf  i_m sure if your handy you can add some sort of support and buy better mounting hardware but i_m incredibly lazy and posting this review has pretty much tapped me out  i will say it does look nice_and color is as_advertised i_ll start by saying shame on me for not checking the shelf dimensions  they appear much larger in the images then they actually are  so for now_it will hold random objects instead_of books  i_can only give it 3 stars though as the shelves are still flimsy even after it s secured to the wall  i would not risk placing fragile or valuable items on this shelf  i will say it does look nice_and color is as_advertised  putting this together and installing it to the wall was also a breeze  if you re not looking to put any large items and don_t mind it being a tad flimsy then this item is for you  the wood option is person is much more dull than_in the picture the wood option is person is much more dull than_in the picture  also the pieces do_not fit well together even though i_used the floor and a book case to check the alignment while i was screwing the pieces together  when on the wall there is space between the shelves and the wall  i_guess they do kind of hold things so_far  and it came on_time with no parts missing  small  cheaply made  needs improvements but looks okay it was unfortunate the screw hiders were very cheaply made and are obvious  the shelves are small  like 4  wide and maybe 10  apart  just holds our remote and has to balance  looks nice once_i fixed all the screw holes to counter sink and not stick out like a child made it  wrong pieces sometimes    be careful  great book shelf but i am happy i_purchased two of them  vendor put all the wrong sizes in one and the_other had the right ones  i give it a two becasue of the lack if attention to detail  since ai am handy inwas able_to manuver the second shelf by drilling in wholes myself to fit the nails    but i_can see a customer being completely annoyed by this defect  other_than that great shelf   it holds up pretty well  if_it wasnt for that    i ended up with unnecessary surplus of the wrong pieces    and the wrong nails  again thank goodness i had some lying around  this_product would have gotten a 5 5  please fix this  great idea and good proportions great idea and good proportions  however ours had a random gouge as_if someone_started to drill a hole and then decided  no  not here    looks cool  and seems somewhat stable even though i_dont     looks cool  and seems somewhat stable even though i_dont have the shelves screwed into support beams  but they didnt give me all_of the right pieces  i ended up getting an extra b piece and i was missing a d piece so now the screws are facing up on one_of the shelves  looks out_of place and kind of ugly relative to the rest of the shelves  picture is deceiving the items shown in the picture that are on the wall mount are larger items that have been photo shopped and sized down to_make it look like they would fit  this mount is much smaller than_it appears to be based on the picture  out_of the_box the shelves were dirty and the white paint was horrible it worked for what i_needed it for but very cheaply made  out_of the_box the shelves were dirty and the white paint was horrible  not a_great quality wood and wont hold much but they will work for now  it s okay looks decent in the corner i put it in  very_easy_to put it together except for me one_of the screws was the wrong size and it started to break  it is very flimsy and light but for what i_need it for it will have to_work sine i_don_t feel like going through the hassle of returning it  
missing screw  shoddy wall anchors  and scratched it was missing a screw  luckily i had extra  the wall anchors had no  bite  and they had no edge bevel  so_i had to_use some extra i had laying around  one_of the shelves were scratched  but not very bad  if_it wasn_t such a pain to put together  i would have returned it  it is a lego display shelf in my kids room  if_i had it in a main room  it would have been unacceptable and returned  oh  and the instructions were miserable  they didn_t bother saying what size drill bit you need for the wall anchor  maybe they figured you d replace them anyhow because of how poor the_quality of the original anchors are  do yourself a favor and do use different anchors you get what you pay_for   but this isn_t worth that  so     i_mean you get what you pay_for  lesson learned but this might not_even be worth that  putting it together wasn_t so difficult but when you do  and you get it up the corner you want_to put it in  you ll find that it doesn_t lay flat on the corner walls which means when you screw in the 3 spaces it has for you to put it to the wall  it s sits off the wall_in places which i forgot to_get a picture of  the plastic pieces that go over the nail are a complete joke  some were broken when they arrived so we only used a_few  it s cheap  if you are on a budge and don_t have a_lot of heavy trinkets to put up  it s okay  i wouldn_t buy it again  it does_not seem sturdy what so ever  i kinda wish i sent it back and just saved my money to_get a really sturdy one  count the screws before you build it  make sure to count the number of screws before counting   we were building our shelf and realized that there weren t enough screws in the_box  we looked veeeery carefully  and there were def not enough  unfortunately  we had already build half the shelf and didn_t want_to disassemble the whole thing just to_get a refund  we ended up having to_go to home depot to_buy more screws because there weren t enough screws to put together the shelf  super annoying   its too small and like another reviewer said its too small and like another reviewer said  walls are not all straight  your walls have to be a perfect 90 degrees for this to look right  the space between shelves was small and the width was small  i ended up selling this on a garage sale site but pretty much recouped my costs  i had over 50 ppl interested in it  i think because of the added space  it seems like a_great idea but its poorly designed and didn_t_work for us  need_to improve qc and kitting the_product looks just as_described but the manufacturer needs to improve its qc and packaging team  while the_product came_with the right amount of shelves  it did_not contain the right configuration parts  i e  instead_of coming with 3x c  1xb and 2xa it came_with 1x a and 5x c  which meant that you can_t just install the shelves per the instructions  review is so low because of this issue  i was able_to engineer the parts to_work but it should be addressed  also  the caps for the screws fit too loose and fall_off if you don_t find a way to adhere them  it looks nice when finished it looks nice when finished  but it s a pain to put together  the instructions were pretty unclear  but with common sense it isn_t difficult to construct  i was personally annoyed by the dry wall anchors  which were very cheap and ineffective  i they all came out_of my wall  and i had to_use my own anchors instead_of the_ones provided  i am disappointed with the construction process of this_product  but the finished product itself isn_t terrible  although the_quality could be better  it fell off the wall though it was easy_to_install  after 2 months hanging on the wall it fell  in the middle of the night   everything_i had on it broke and so did the shelving unit  it was great while it lasted but overall terrible quality  like the look but doesn_t fit right into corner tried_to_install_in my daughters room and it could very likely be the walls   but difficult to fit into the corner will have to rig it  and the drywall screws popped right_out  completely inefficient  waiting to_install the_other one  do houses ever come_with right angles any more  horrible instructions made it nearly impossible to assemble the instructions were a joke  parts were unlabeled and the directions might as_well have been in a foreign language with how little sense they made  it took me wayyy too long to put together  the_only positive thing_i_can say is that it looks exactly_as_advertised and is pretty  
don_t waste your money      i couldn_t be more disappointed if_i_tried  i set this_thing up_and it took maybe 10 minutes for it to fall apart  screwed in the screws in each section and i_didn_t_even tighten them as hard as they should have because the particle wood started coming apart immediately  the anchor points you get are three  had a total amount of maybe 4lbs and the whole thing came crashing down  luckily it was lego figures that were hanging so putting it back together is_not a big deal  it s now sitting in the_same corner i put it up because_if_i pick it up right now  i will fling it across the room and damage something else  don_t waste your money  make your own with real wood from homedepot or get it from someone that uses real wood  super cute  but disappointing  super cute and different than your typical shelf  great way to_make use of the dreaded corner space  i_didn_t give it a five because_it seems a_little flimsy  but it may be that i wasn_t able_to screw the screws tight enough  we ll see what happens once_i attach it to the wall tonight   update 4 22 18  finally hung the shelf and was disappointed to find that the holes were not all_in the right places  as nany times as_i_tried  i could not get all_of the shelves attached because the hotes for the screws weren t in the right places  be prepared for this if you buy it  missing hardware   cant use missing what hardware is needed to assemble the shelves    cannot use due to this   very_disappointed  do_not_buy this was so_incredibly disappointing  the wood is cheap  when i_went in to screw it together the screw just spun around  the wood wasn_t dense enough_to hold the screw in place  it crack and fell apart  when i would get one section done and hold it up the piece would slip right off the wood get what you pay_for  posting pictures to show the low cheap quality  there are scrarches and nicks all over the particle board  and some of the predrilled screw holes don_t align  i_m more upset about the scratches on the visible sides  i just pulled this out_of the_box  guess this will be in the kids play room not my living room   warning  it nice to look at  but the package didn_t arrive with the proper amount of screws listed in the instructions  so_i had to trek over to a hardware store to_get the proper kind  also  one_of the holes that was drilled to_install the piece into the wall was double drilled and so the piece was loose  had to fill it with suguru to tighten it up
