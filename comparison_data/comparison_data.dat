great blender  excellent customer_service i_bought this blender exactly 1 year ago and i am now writing my review on it  i never write reviews but my experience with ninja s customer_service was so exceptional that i felt compelled to write one  i_ll start by saying the ninja is an_excellent blender for  70  i blend frozen fruit with it every single day  it pulverizes everything_into a smooth drink every time  about 1 week ago  for an unknown reason  my blender stopped working  when i_went to turn it on the_power button just started blinking instead  i wasn_t sure what this meant so_i emailed ninja  the representative was kind  attentive  and replied to my emails extremely promptly  sometimes within minutes   i let him know what happened  and all he asked me for was  1  the blender model number 2  where i_purchased the blender and the approximate date of purchase 3  the warranty number  which happens to be just a 4 digit number engraved on the prongs which plug in to your electrical outlet  as soon as_i gave him that information  he emailed me with a confirmation of shipment of a_new pitcher along with a tracking number  the new pitcher arrived_in 3 business days and my blender is working like_new again  i never figured out what was wrong with the old pitcher or why it was preventing my blender from turning on   i_love companies that provide exceptional customer_service and i will never purchase another blender other_than ninja  thank you ninja  blade housing   operator error to all the people giving this blender a poor review because they were harmed by blades  popping out   the blender lid locks in and the lid itself has a pouring spout that you are supposed to open to pour the drink or smoothie out with  personally i_like how easy it is to remove the blades  makes for easy cleaning if you re making something more_than a smoothie where you have to_take the entire lid off  you can reach in  grab the head of the blade attachment and just easily pull the blade out  it s a fantastic product and you can_t blame the_product for a  design flaw  when it s simply operator error  smoothie magic there are some products that just change your life  i_wanted to_get in on the smoothie thing  and there simply is no other way to_do it than with a blender  and no better blender to_do it with  the blender is mostly plastic  but it doesn_t feel cheap  it is very secure  it locks onto the base with a satisfying click  the lid locks down with a similar click  unless you have heard both clicks  the blender won_t start  and good thing  the blades are very sharp  they are angled to create a vortex that instantly turns any fruits and vegetables inside into viscous liquid  i_like that the spout has a lid that locks open so you can pour easily  the blades come out so that they can be cleaned easily  along with the inside of the decanter  i saw that another buyer was cut when the blades  flew out  during cleaning  i have looked carefully and my blade assembly does_not appear to be capable of flight or even mild levitation  nonetheless i lift it out carefully  and if_i am going_to_use the blender again i just rinse the blades  if_i want the blades completely clean i_use the dishwasher and not my hands  it has been a long time since_i_used a blender  i stopped because they sucked  old blenders leaked out the bottom  they were hard to clean  they had a ton of different buttons for blending speed with labels that required a thesaurus next to the cookbook  and however i parsed the gradations of perturbation between  emulsify  and  macerate   they didn_t actually blend  what was at the bottom of the blender became angry and confused while whatever was_in the top two thirds of the decanter remained beatifically serene  this blender has high  medium  and low settings  you can pulse  it is loud  which i take to be a feature and not a drawback  even more_than my espresso machine  this blender is extremely effective at ending unwanted conversations  for particularly persistent interlocutors  use the pulse setting  neither my kids nor i particularly like fruits and vegetables and as a result we don_t get nearly enough  and yet i_can put in 10 bananas  two cartons of strawberries  two of blueberries  a bag of spinach  yes  spinach    a cup of plain greek yogurt  one_interrupted conversation     and  ambrosia  the decanter is huge  and yet between the three of us we can and do empty it in one meal  yay  amazing i was a_little skeptical on spending so_much for a blender after reading some of the reviews that said they had troubles with equipment failure  i_bought my ninja with a 4 year warranty for about  11 for peace of mind  i am glad i_purchased the warranty  i would hate for anything to happen to my ninja  i am loving it so_far  i_ve had it for about a_month and i_make a smoothie about every other day  it has helped tremendously for weight loss and eating healthier  it s easy_to hide some healthy foods in your smoothie and not_even notice them  my favorite part of the ninja has to be how easy it is to_set_up_and clean  in total  the ninja has 3 pieces   blender cup  blade and top   which makes it a quick clean  the blade comes out very easily and i_can clean my ninja in about a minute and reassemble it in seconds  the fact that it s such an easy_set_up_and quick cleaning process leads me to keep making more and more smoothies  i have found that peanut butter and some heavier foods do tend to stick to the side of the blender  but for the most part  everything gets blended down really nice  this is my best purchase of the summer  i_used to have an old magic bullet and this blows it out_of the water  i would highly_recommend this to anybody who is on the fence of buying it  great blender i was concerned buying this blender because of some of the reviews about blades popping out  so when the blender came  i was sure to be very careful with the insides   to my relief there are many safety precautions on this blender to_make sure that the blades stay on the inside  and once reading the instructions all my concerns went away  the locking lid and easy pour top make it so_i_don_t need_to remove the top when pouring smoothies  and when making salsa  the_first thing_i_do when the top is removed is to_take the blades out  easy_to clean  and remove   i would purchase this again  rivals the vitamix  at one fifth the_cost this is a_great blender that rivals my much more expensive vitamix  ive taken a break from my vitamix 5200  which retails for 5 times the_cost of this blender  to test this_one out for a_week  i_love it  it gives my vitamix a run for the_money  here are some observations  for chopping  this blender is impressive  it looks so_much like a food processor that i_tried chopping an onion  and got acceptable results  i would absolutely use this for that   the vitamix cant do this at_all   for ice crushing  yes  yes  yes  yes  snow_in blazingly fast time  sno cones  margaritas  whatever  this blender has that application covered  fantastic results  far better_than the vitamix  for pulverizing  i_thought it was very_good  this was the area that the vitamix outshone the ninja  but i think the ninja did just_fine  in my homemade jalapeo coleslaw dressing  the blender didnt quite get all the jalapeo pulverized  and there were little chunks still in the dressing  the ninja had a_little trouble pulverizing 2 large bunches of kale  and i had to stop the blender a_few times to_use a scraper to push the leaves down  i also needed to_add some water to aid in the blending  the leaves ended up rather smoothly pulverized  although i_dont think they were quite as fine as_in the vitamix  i_love how the blades remove completely from the pitcher every single time  it not only makes it easier to scrape out all the food from the blender but also to_get it perfectly clean  the vitamix always ends up with food stuck under the blades  and if_its something like hummus  its really hard to_get it clean  so the design on the blades in the ninja is brilliant  be careful  though  those blades are sharp  i_managed to to slice my hands open on two separate occasions while trying_to put them in or take them out_of the dishwasher  seriously  having tried this blender  i_cant see recommending that anyone spend the extra money for a vitamix  this is a really nice blender  love it  this rascal will cut up_and pulverize     love it  this rascal will cut up_and pulverize some frozen fruit quick  the pitcher connects quick to base with one hand also the pour tap will lock in the open position which is helpful  cleanup is fast_and easy but careful with the blade device pick up_and wash s l o w l y because_it is very sharp  we had a nutribullet and the_power base went bad so after some amazon shopping and a_lot of reviews this arrived 2 days later and it is preferred over the previous device we had  just a_little history at no extra charge      my wife and myself have chemo treatments and have found that it helps to self doctor if you can so we have a smoothie every morning consisting of cottage cheese and flax seed oil  cancer killers  and the taste is covered up with frozen fruit  almond milk and a_good ripe banana  i added to let you know_it is used daily with great results compared to infrequent use  hope this helps you make a decision  i_like it a bunch  i_used to_use a food processor but  being we are a small family  i_ve found this blender will do most everything my processor did  the_quality feels great_and it s easy_to clean up  it s my favorite appliance these days  this blender is a boss  for the last couple_of years  i have been making veggie smoothies  because you know  health  they are gross  but necessary for my health  in the past  it would take me at least 5 6 minutes for the smoothie to blend in my ol  trusty cuisinart  i would have to stir and stir before magically  everything was blended to perfection  i couldn_t justify spending      on a high dollar blender  because_it s a blender and i_d prefer to spend my discretionary income on something more sustainable  like shoes  sarcasm   lately  my old blender has been heating up quickly_and the motor gives off the  i am about to die  smell  so  off i_went to the great internet highway in search of blender reviews  i stumbled upon this blender and read the review located near the top  which made me chuckle  i took the plunge and ordered it  wow  it blends like a freaking boss  it blended everything  avocado  spinach  bananas  blueberries  ice  other gross stuff  in seconds  no longer will i have to retreat to my spoon arsenal to_get everything blended  this sucker blends like a champ and i_love the pour spout  no green gross sad spinach stains on my counter  hooray  if you make smoothies and don_t want_to shell out big money  this blender is for you  for the_money  it s a_great_deal  powerful wow  this blender is magnificent  these blades will cut anything  i_bought this mostly to_make pineapple hull juice and it easily works as_described  now_i_use it all the_time  besides its power  this blender is beautifully designed   it has all sorts of security features  so_it s impossible to screw things up   for example  the lid is airtight and has a sensor click that will prevent the blender from turning on if_it s open  there is also a  power  button you must turn_on first  so there is no risk of blending anything by accident or getting startled  oh  and it has a_very obvious way of attaching the body to the base  remember those blenders you had to try a million_times to rotate the thing_into the base  and still you weren t_even sure it was securely attached   yea  not with the ninja  best purchase i_ve made in a while   great blender i was contemplating breaking the bank and buy the vitamix which was like  400  so glad that i gave this_one a try instead  not stating the obvious money saving  but unless you want_to_make soup without the stove or some crazy stuff  this blender is an_excellent choice  we pulverized ice to_make snow cone_in no time  fruits and vegis gets blended into smoothly nicely  love the_product  just be careful when cleaning the blades  they are very sharp  i_do love this_thing i_do love this_thing  this is my second one  it does the job of a vitimix for a fraction of the_cost  the drawback with this particular model is that if a part breaks  the lid broke on my first one   replacement parts are hard to come by  and if you do want a replacement  it will be cheaper to_buy the entire unit than the part  ninja has so many different versions of this_thing and the parts are usually not interchangeable  but  aside from that  it works_great  best blender i_ve used   i_love my ninja and absolutely cannot say enough about it  first off the_power of it is amazing compared to all the_other blenders i_ve used such as oyester  black and decker  and a_couple others  it s power is far stronger than all the_others i_ve used  but what s more amazing about it is that it s so_much quieter than the_others  it s a win  win situation for sure  this blender is also a food processor so the range of things that can be done with it is limitless  i enjoy juicing fruits and vegetables  but don_t like typical juicers because_it throws away all the pulp  and that is where the vast majority of nutrients are  with the ninja i get the_best quality of fresh juices  smoothies  and protein drinks  i also really enjoy making my baby s food  and with the ninja it truly makes it a breeze  only the_best for my little one  i have also made soup with it by blending my steamed veggies and then heated on the stove  the cleanup is so_much easier than any other blender i_ve used as_well  i have been using my ninja for already 5 months and it works_like a charm  this_product is something_i would recommend to anyone  tons of room and power after years of using and burning out cheap blenders i finally decided to upgrade to this quality blender and i am so  so glad i_did  this has a_very sturdy base which does_not shift while blending  the carafe locks into place with ease and does_not shift at_all while blending either  the lid also locks into place and does_not move while blending or pouring so there is no need_to hold the top of the blender while it is going  the carafe holds a ton of stuff as_well so fewer batches are needed when pureeing large recipes such as soup  the blades are super sharp and slide into place quickly_and easily  they are not mounted to the bottom  similar to a food processor blade  so_it is easiest to keep the lid on and pour through the pour hole on the corner and then remove the lid and blade unit for washing afterwards  contrary to other reviews it does_not  pop out  for no reason  it does  however  fall out if you hold the_unit upside down with the lid off  due to gravity   this is incredibly powerful as_well  i_very rarely need_to process anything for more_than 30 seconds no matter what it is  i puree soups and make smoothies and milkshakes all_in under thirty seconds of blending  ice simply gets eaten up_and there are no large chunks as_i_ve found with other brands and models  i also use this to puree food scraps for my worm composting unit and it fully purees a full carafe of eggplant peels  pepper insides  and celery ends  along with some water  into a v8 consistency in thirty seconds  overall  this is one_of the_best additions to my kitchen this year and worth every single penny  i highly  highly_recommend it  frozen fruit smoothies  no problem  smooth  ninja lives up to the hype  smoothies are smooth  the_unit works as advertized  appears to be an_excellent product  i_make my smoothies with frozen fruit which is very hard on blenders  this did a_great job of converting the frozen fruit to a smooth consistency with no chunks or uncut pieces  it did_not appear to strain  the question is  will it hold up to_doing this day after day  i am betting the answer is yes  the design is quite good  i_bought this_unit to_replace a breville that had died from hacking one too many bags of frozen strawberries  where breville makes a beefy brute force machine that hacks the fruit  the ninja is a smart design that cuts  as another commenter mentioned  the stacked blades are ingenious  the blades appear flimsy but their shape and sharpness does_not expose them to forces that might harm them so they appear to be up to the task  the blade stack reaches all the_way to the lid and this is one_of the design innovations  by having a bearing in the lid it dramatically reduces the lateral torque on the main bearing thus allowing it to be much smaller  smart and efficient means less stress on components and less power is required  this is why i anticipate it will last longer despite weighing about 1 3rd of what my old breville boat anchor weighed  and it costs about 1 4 what it would to_replace my breville with an equivalent model  designed for the_internet age  light so shipping is in expensive  clever design so that it is exposed to less wear and tear  hope to be back in a year with a glowing report of long life  watch out for the blades  this is a rare case where razor sharp really means razor sharp handle with care or you will get cut  i suspect the lifetime of this blender is mostly dictated by how long the blades remain sharp  must have blender recipe 2 oz white rum  don q cristal   1 oz coco lopez coconut cream  1 oz heavy cream  6 oz pineapple juice  1 cup of ice  1 spoonful of unsweetened coconut shreds  put aforementioned ingredients only in a ninja blender on medium blend for 11 seconds  garnish with a cherry  pineapple and cocktail umbrella and blaaaam  a perfect pina freakin colada brah very_good blender   very_good blender  it meets all expectations  with the cutting system of several blades allows to grind up to the ice  it is a robust blender  the use is easy_and safe  it is_not heavy  the jar is made of plastic  the lid has several opening systems that make it easy_to_use  the_price benefit ratio is excellent  the packaging box is excellent  the_seller made the shipment on_time_and the_product was received on_time  the_product arrived_in_good_condition  worth the_money  best blender i_ve ever had  i_purchased this blender a_few months ago  i was hesitant to spend the extra money for a ninja  since_i usually purchase oster or black and decker blenders  but this was such a_great decision  the blades going up the entire blender makes it so_much easier for my smoothies to turn out consistent  especially since_i_use frozen fruits  and it blends rediculously fast  i_make smoothies daily and i won_t ever buy another brand  the_price was seriously worth the splurge since_i_use it constantly  and this looked good  i_liked the description about the technology to     i am a diehard vitamix person  but wanted a second blender to keep where i rent in the winter  i_did_not want_to spend the_money for another vitamix  and this looked good  i_liked the description about the technology to crunch ice  because that was my biggest challenge with  regular  blenders  i_use a_lot of ice in my shakes  this blender is awesome  crunches the ice with ease  i probably will never get a vitamix again  as this is just as_good_but for a much better price  this_thing_is a marvel of smart design and high quality precision manufacturing this_thing_is a marvel of smart design and high quality precision manufacturing  they do_not lie   fill it with ice cubes  run it and you get snow  because_it has blades top to bottom this baby kicks out my breakfast smoothie in less_than a minute  everything_is good  the poor spout stays open when pouring by magnets or magic  i_can_tell but it stays up  yet never opens when blending  the pitcher locks onto the motor logically and effortlessly  clean up is easy  warm water and a drop of soap  run on high for a minute and rinse  done  it s even really easy_to clean the base  sealed and wipe able all around  bummed i_didn_t get one_of these long ago      month or two now_and so_far it s been perfect  i_mostly use it to_make smoothies but     i_ve been using this blender for a_month or two now_and so_far it s been perfect  i_mostly use it to_make smoothies but have used it for other recipes as_well  it s_not the most powerful but it definitely gets the job done more_than enough  awesome i have had a basic blender forever  i have wanted one_of these for a long time  finally got it  this is a_great blender  it isn_t as loud   easy_to assemble and clean  there were some reviews that mentioned the blade popped out when pouring the contents  the instructions clearly state leave the lid on  it holds the blade in place   and use the pouring spout  if contents too thick  remove lid  and blade  you can grab it safely from the top   and then pour out  just read the instructions before you use it     i_love it   i was looking_for a vitamix alternative when i came     i was looking_for a vitamix alternative when i came across this blender  when i was trying_to_make crushed ice  it was so strong  it turned the ice into snow    the blades are also very sharp as_i cut myself trying_to clean the blender  super    i_love this blender   it works_great   other reviews stated that they got hurt using this blender or cleaning it  but if you close the lid properly and pour your shake into a cup through the top  secured  opening  then you will be just_fine     and to clean it  just make sure you carefully take the blades out and wash that separately  if you follow these steps  then i promise that you will be injury free    definitely recommend this blender    4 years and still going strong  ive had my ninja for nearly four years and its still going strong  my average use is about 3 times week  it still blends great  ive never had the plastic break  ive never been cut by the blades  handle it with care and youll definitely get your moneys worth out_of this investment  great purchase i never thought i_d get excited over a blender  how did i live so long without this_thing  it is well designed  easy_to clean  i_like the_way the blades are held in place by the lid which makes them easy_to remove  it is powerful  and with three blades  blends in a snap  wish i had purchased this years ago    better_than a normal blender so_much better_than a normal blender  really gets everything_into a liquid state quickly  easier to_use and clean than a food processor  i_use it for fresh fruit smoothies almost daily  no problem handling ice cubes or sticky ingredients like almond butter  just have to_take care cleaning the removable center stem with six very sharp blades on it  it s taller than our blender was  so we actually can_t push it up against the wall under the cabinet  so we store it with the blender jar removed  great_for smoothies  after my old blender gave up the ghost  i_got this  i was a_little skeptical because of the plastic canister    but man is this_thing awesome  i_love the_power and the design is perfect   the tall blade unit is easy_to_take out and clean  frozen smoothie stuff never gets stuck or needs stirring like my old blender  i_didn_t use my old blender as much as_i would have liked  because_it was such a hassle to_get smoothies pureed to the right consistency  but my kids and i have been using this ninja every morning now for a_couple_of weeks  this is the_best blender i have had i have used this now for a_few months before writing a review  this is the_best blender i have had  i_can_t afford the vitamix  so_i_bought this  i juice protein powder with frozen fruit almost everyday now  and only because this makes it so easy  blends ice water frozen fruit and powder so well  my husband loves me having it because we both benefits with the protein drinks  this is and affordable amazing blender  can you really be in love with your blender    yes  oh my yes   we are in love with our ninja blender  it will blend anything and it is so safe and easy_to clean  the design is incredible  my husband blends smoothies with protein and frozen fruit and i_used to dread the mess he made  the ninja comes apart in such a way that it is easy_to clean_and the blades lift out  i_love the safety handle  you cannot take of the lid with the ninja in motion and trust me this is a_good thing  the blades are so sharp  caution when cleaning blades  use a long dish washing brush to clean instead_of a sponge or rag because of the sharpness and shape of the blades  don_t leave them around small children  adopt a ninja today  it is as strong as_it looks  that s for sure  i_loved it  it s easy_to clean  and i_loved the safety feature  it also has a_very soft lock system  and you only need_to clean 3 things  the jug  the lid and the easily removable blades  there s no rubber blade plastic combo that takes hours to dry out or smells like baby vomit  no  just one long set of blades in hard plastic  omg   o i only had cheap blenders before this   a whole life of regret    i_love this blender prior to ordering this ninja blender  i had been using another  it was heavy  glass  with a sort of vintage y vibe  after receiving and using the bl610  i_don_t know what took me so long  i_love this blender  it s thorough  quick  and simple to_use  i_love that it blinks when it s plugged in but the lid isn_t on correctly  super easy_to clean  too  i_ve been tons of things with this_thing    from salsas to smoothies  my only advice would be to_make sure to_take the blade out before pouring  and be careful when hand washing  or just picking up  the blade  margaritas forever nothing worse than having your old blender die right in the middle of a batch of margaritas  my son had been singing the praise of his blender so_i_decided to order one up  glad i_did  this_thing creates incredible ice shavings which are excellent for making adult snow cones  as_well as kiddy versions  and it also blends up mean margaritas with only a_few seconds of blending  unit is well constructed and the features were well designed  easy pouring lid  locking top  clear controls with good sized buttons  easy grip handle   you won_t be disappointed with this_unit  powerful blender  easy_to_use and clean    great_for frozen drinks alcohol included  and smoothies  i always wanted a powerful blender but all_of them are so expensive  anyway  i bumped into this_one and when i saw the reviews and the_price       i said i_can_t say no to this  i am very_happy_with this  as soon as_it arrived  2or 3 days maybe  i wash it  and the_first thing_i_did was to_do the ice test of course    hmmm  frozen strawberry margaritas  smothies  etc  well  with a_little bit of noise  my dog ran away to my daughter s room  it passed the ice test  in seconds i had crushed ice  the next step was to instruct my daughter to never ever put her hands inside the container  no matter what  even if_is_not on  she looked at me with big open eyes    yes never  these are extra sharp blades  this morning i prepared my first smoothie  kale  carrots  pear  honey  banana and ice  i will not say the drink is delicious  but the blender did his job  in seconds all the fruits and veggies were crushed and blended  you will not be disappointed  go for it  easy_to_use  powerful and easy_to clean  ninja professional blender this is without the_best blender for the_money period  in the past i have used from waring to kitchen aid and none_of them crushed ice like this blender does  brought it for smoothies and protein drinks  consistency is like at a juice bar  well_worth the_money five_stars makes great smoothies  couldn_t be happier this is how much i_love this blender    i included it when loading the car with a_few belongings prior to evacuating for hurricane irma  it completely delivers on all its promises  there are multiple warnings about handling the blades  and they are indeed sharp  i_don_t have a dishwasher and hand washing the blade is painstaking  so_i_ve started filling the jar half up with soapy water and running it on low to swish clean the blades  works_great  what a joy  my mother who lives with us needs to have her food pureed now  the blender we had could not handle pureeing many of our usual food items  after some research i_decided to try the ninja professional blender  bl610   now most_evenings when mom smells dinner cooking she can look forward to enjoying the_same freshly prepared meal we are having  what a joy  new generation design shows how far we ve come_with a blender sturdy  well designed blender that an grind anything without breaking a sweat  easier than anything_i have seen prior to clean as you easily remove the blades and clean the inside very quickly  blades just wash off and that s good because they re sharp beyond description  and the design of the lid is genius  really like the_way it locks into place on the base so you don_t get partial engagement of the driving gear  nice design  good_value for money  frappe anyone   the instructions are clear  turns ice into anything frosty that you can_think of  do you have any idea how much starbucks charges for a coffee slush  it s paid for itself twice over already  i_m in love   great_and very affordable  first of all  this is my first blender that was manufactured later than the 70s  thanks mom for the hand me down osterizer   i am a product of the 80s  so yeah  obviously  much improved  i_ve been excited to_get up this past week to_make my coffee smoothies before work  it is loud  i hope that my neighbor doesn_t hear it downstairs  but i_don_t know_if there is such thing as a blender that can quietly chop up ice  one_of my cats watches me prep my smoothie but runs when i turn it on  and the_other cat runs over to_see what is making that noise  so_it s tolerable for a non fraidy cat  i_ve read reviews of complaints that the blade doesn_t snap in and people have cut their hands  so_i was nervous about that  but i sat down and read the instruction manual all the_way through and it states it a bunch of_times that the blade doesn_t snap in and to lift it out before you pour with the lid off  so_i_ve paid very close attention to that  always be sure to read instructions  reviews have complained that the blender somehow broke within weeks of purchasing it  if you read the instructions  you ll see to register it within 10 days and they have a one year warranty  i highly_recommend this blender and it s super affordable  my mom said her vitamix heats up whatever she puts in it  so_i was worried my smoothie might come out warm  but it stays cold  maybe it s a better blender for 1 4 of the_cost  pro tip  from mom   after using  fill the blender with warm water a_little bit away from the top with a tiny amount of dish soap and run on high and it washes out the pitcher     scary powerful and fast  intense you guys got it right totally more intense powerful machine then my oster  really fast  great clever safety features to prevent injury from large blade  much better machine than_expected  unfortunately it did_not create a fine creamy shake  the shakes were coarse in texture with chips and pieces  no longer how long it ran  my oster took longer but produces a much much finer creamier result  good blender   great_for smoothies so_far so_good  great_for smoothies  having the blades along a shaft from bottom to top of pitcher seems_to result in faster more efficient action when compared to models with blades only at the bottom  the pitcher is fairly large so_if you only want_to_do one serving at a time you might consider similar models that include the option of individual serving containers  i prefer this size to_make a full batch and keep second or third servings for another day or two without any apparent loss of freshness  you do need_to be careful in handling the blade shaft especially when washing by hand or reassembling   the blades are very sharp  arrived_in perfect working order everything well_packaged arrived_in perfect working order everything well_packaged  i_m 30 so_i_ve seen a_lot of blenders over the years  this blender is one_of the_best i_ve used and i_ve only had it in my home for a_few hours  first and fore most the lid locks down and may be trusted not to pop off  second  the blades are not locked in place making removal easy  third  and sadly the_only flaw i_don_t recommend this blender for ice  it s wonderful  does everything_i_ve ever asked it to  i_ve been putting this blender through its paces with a chutney recipe that requires blending fresh ginger  which my previous blender failed at miserably  wow  is this ninja ever a star  it also has several layers of very sharp blades  which cuts down on_time  one_of the_best features is that if you don_t have it securely put together it won_t run  it s easy_to_use  easy_to clean  blades and container are dishwasher friendly  and the lid usually only requires a soapy water rinse   and works_like  well  a ninja  you will not go wrong with this blender  works as_advertised  in addition to being the real deal  the_unit has a number of safety features which will ensure family members do_not get hurt or make another mess for me to clean up  the container has to be  screwed  into the base unti  the cap has to be locked in place  if one_of these do_not occur  the_power light flashed indicating something_is wrong  under this condition  the_unit will not run  i_like it  no more hammers or mess just got it today  to test it  i put in the ice from a whole 2 ice cube trays to_see what it could do  15 seconds later  i had all the ice shavings  and more  than_i_needed  now  i_ve to figure out a way to store the shavings so they re still crushed ice  but if don_t  it ll only take 15 second  or less  to have the crushed ice you alway wanted    and now that s it s summer    how good does that sound  way too much fun  i_can not explain how much i_love my new blender  yes the blades are extremely sharp  and i would advise anyone to be careful with them  when washing them  other_than that the motor is big and powerful and crushes anything within seconds  it is pretty loud so  i would advise you to_make smoothies or whatever it is  when everyone_is up  so that you do_not disturb them  powerful  fast_and makes effortless perfect smoothies   finally  i_can make a quick easy smoothie   effortlessly  its powerful   does the job in seconds  i_dont have to_take the lid off 10 times during the process to shove the ice or fruit down lower towards the blades to_make sure it all gets in  this pulls everything together on its own and you have a perfect smoothie within seconds to a minute  the blade isnt the typical small little attached piece on the bottom  its a long blade that is removeble   which makes the whole process much easier and blends evenly  no more shoving it all to the bottom   love it  easy_to assemble  easy_to clean  3 pieces   you can_toss it right in the dishwasher when you are done  a blender that lives up to the hype since receiving it a_week ago i_ve used it to_make smoothies every morning  not only does it quickly_and efficiently pulverize ice  greens  and frozen fruit in moments but it mixes ingredients well   no chunks of protein powder or almond butter left untouched  the pour spout on the lid is key to easy transfer to your glass  it completely eliminates the risk of smoothie ending up all over the counter  it s also really easy_to clean  i take the blades out immediately after use and rinse them clean in seconds  sometimes i leave the rest to soak during the day with some soapy water and when i get home later in the day it just needs a rinse and any sticky residue washes away easily  can_t recommend this blender enough  very_happy  we use this mixer for smoothies   love it  this beats any standard blender  just be sure to clean up right after your done and it s very_easy_to keep clean  the super sharp blades slice frozen fruit   ice   bolts  just kidding    but in any case  the blender is awesome  this is our second one  we used to own an older model and the_only reason we needed a_new_one was the old one fell off the counter and broke the container  manufactured solid and with good quality parts  amazing  best blender i ever had   so powerful  looks very_nice_and modern  cuts through ice like bananas  blends smoothies in seconds  i_love the mutiple level blades  love the squarish pitcher  very_easy_to clean  good safety features  pour spout is usefull  extremly good_product and atleast half the_price of its competition  professional quality forsure  make you just wanna bleand something  lol  love  love love  love  love this  make smooth smoothies using many ingredients  makes a head of caulflower rice in 3 pulses  use it all the_time  recommended with three sets of blades  not just one set on the bottom  this blender does a_nice job making smoothies  the lid locks on to the pitcher and the pitcher locks onto the base  remember the old days when we would keep our hand on the lid when blending  just in case  no need here  there are three power settings  low  medium  and high  it also has pulse  for cleaning  the center piece with the blades comes out easily  i put the pitcher  blades  and lid in the dishwasher  we ve been using this for six months now_and we re very_pleased  simple professional grade blender with affordable price for the_price  this is no doubt an_excellent blender  i_love to blend smoothies as meal substitute  the multi blades feature is great  all i have to_do is stuff in all the ingredients and turn it on  30 seconds later i will have my finely blended smoothies ready  no more problem with ingredients stuck in the middle  some people mention in the review that they have problem with the detachable blade  but i_can only think of one scenario that would cause such problem  which is press the release button while the blender is blending  the blender has a locking mechanism on the lid  the blender cannot start without the lid close and locked  just need_to be careful not to unlock the lid while blending  and make sure the lid is secured before start  i personally love the removable blade  it is so easy_to clean_and dry  i had so_much problem with my old blender when the blade got dirty  but not anymore  this blender design is very_well thought  practical  powerful  and easy_to maintain  with this affordable price_and performance of a professional blender  you just cannot ask for more  this is the blender you ve been looking_for  this is the blender i was looking_for  i_wanted something better_than the  25 35 oster  hamilton beach or black   decker  but i_didn_t want or need the expensive breville or vitamix  it s multi blade spindle makes quick work of fruit or ice  blending everything completely  an extremely simple control panel   low  medium and high  plus pulse   what more could anyone want  do be warned  the blades are crazy sharp   but i clean mine the_way i_ve cleaned every blender i_ve ever owned   adding a_few drops of dish soap and some warm or hot water to the blender jar  run it for a_few seconds and rinse it out  only handle the blade spindle by the very top and you will never lose another drop of blood  this_thing_is great  it rips up frozen fruit like nothing man  this_thing_is great  it rips up frozen fruit like nothing  used to have to warm up the frozen fruit before blending  no such problem now  best bang for your buck i_purchased this due to the_price point and good reviews in hopes that it performed just as_good as the  350  500 blenders  i have to_say that it has outdone_itself proving that it takes little to no effort blending up my smoothies on a daily basis  i would definitely recommend this compared to the more expensive blenders  take the rest of the_money that you save after buying this to purchase other needed appliances  ice beware         this will conquer you  i_love this blender  the 9cup capacity is far more practical than the lesser 6 cup blender distant cousins  it will be perfect_for margarita time  three blades to blend whatever the hell you shove down in there  the lid locks into place as does the pitcher  no more blender mishaps with the ill fitting  flimsy lids     a solid blender that makes a fine addition to all the kitchen gadgets that one needs for a_good time  my key to healthier eating  love this blender  incredible with frozen fruit and invigor8 protein  health mix  so happy i chose this blender  i had an older osterizer blender and a nutribullet    the osterizer was ancient and started leaking at the bottom by the blade  wouldn_t blend my smoothies without frequent stiring  and i hated unscrewing the pieces to clean it  the nutribullet needed to be stirred to blend as_well  and was even worse  i had issues_with leaking with it as_well  i personally want my smoothies a smoothie consistency not a watery drink  this blender is perfect_for me  it has a_lot of great features and was obviously made with convenience in mind at every step  we are protein  health shake junkies  for our smoothies we mix invigor8 smoothie powder in with water  frozen fruits  and vanilla yogurt  these smoothies taste like desert and the ability to_make them thicker in a blender like this is incredible  i am one_of those people that never outgrew the issue with chunks and weird textures in my food  this blender successfully blended my thick smoothie to perfection  for those who haven_t tried it  buy some invigor8 and use it in smoothies with this blender    they have chocolate and vanilla  so_good_and extremely healthy  if you like chocolate    the brownie invigor8 mix with frozen banana  a_little frozen strawberry  some water  and some vanilla yogurt literally tastes like a banana split  this blender is my key to healthier eating and i am in love  efficient  easy_to clean  powerful  loud this performs like_new even though it s refurbished  the three tiers of blades are excellent for large volume blending  the_unit is large but not bulky  the cord wrap area on the_back_of the motor housing is very convenient  i enjoy how everything locks into place   the blending container onto the base and the lid onto the container  it s very_easy_to clean because the blades come out all at once easily without any weird holes or needing to root around the bottom of a blender with a sharp object  i imagine there is no quiet blender but being that this_one_is powerful  it s ridiculously loud  easy_to clean  powerful and efficient at blending there are 5 thing_i_love in particular about this_unit compared to other blenders that i_ve used before  1  fantastic power that ll cut through anything frozen that i toss in 2  the three pairs of blades at low  middle and high heights inside completely eliminates the need_to_use a spoon halfway through blending to push down a top layer of un blended material  this immensely adds to the speed at which i_can blend  3  the volume of 72oz is very generous and allows me to better make a gallon pitcher of watermelon juice for example 4  the plastic construction is very durable and eliminates the need for any gaskets that can potentiate leaks like is glass blenders  the simplicity of the removable blade  which makes it easier to_replace if_it were to break or wear down  and a single lid also makes this very_easy_to clean  just put in some water and soap  run the blender for a_few seconds  and rinse out after  5  small detail  but i_very much appreciate that there is a way to wrap to cord  like on a vacuum cleaner  on the_back side  instead_of on the bottom or not at_all   this helps reduce its footprint on my counter top where i_like to keep it  will easily stand up to the vitamix yes  this is the blender of all blenders  easy_to clean  easy_to_set_up  easy_to pour  easy_to turn_on and use  forget the vitamix because this blender is just as_good  trust me  my aunt has a vitamix and this is exactly the_same for a small fraction of the_price   warning  the blade in the center is_not fixed onto the blender jar  it it loose so be careful when you open and reach in there  i read another review that said a man was cut and he blamed the blender  sorry  no  the blade won_t  jump out  at you but it is loose  with that being said  yes  yes to this blender  you need it  you ll regret not getting it  thick plastic jar  click release lid  pour spout  3 settings  low  med  high   measurements on jar and a twist lock to secure jar to base  this blender is awesome at chopping ice  making dough  salsa  smoothies and iced coffee   get this today  
owned 6 weeks i_m a healthcare professional and bought this after researching the competition  i e    vita mix   after reading through a gazillion comments and reviews  including cr who rates the ninja  2  i opted for the lower priced ninja  i have used mine twice a day for the 6 weeks i have owned it  i_use it for making smoothies  i blend for health  i have a morning fruit and berry smoothie and i have an afternoon veggie smoothie  blending is a really convenient way to_get in all your servings of fruit and veggies each day without removing the  very important  fiber  so_far  i_love my ninja  i have had stuff made with a vita mix in the past  but have never done a side by side comparison  though i_can_think of a_few differences that are meaningful for me  one  the vita mix generates heat  they use it as a selling feature  that you can use it to_make soups  but i_like my smoothies cold  so_it s_not something_i look for in a blender  secondly  vita mix seems_to win in all the comparisons with ninja on smoothness  or thoroughness of blending  the_only reason i knocked one_star off the ninja is because_i have noticed that my smoothies are a_bit chewier after several weeks of blender use  i attribute that to the fact that ninja relies  apparently  on their sharp blades  which naturally dull with use especially when blending frozen berries or ice  which both of my smoothies contain   i_ve noticed a subtle change in texture  no chunks  but definitely not a fine blend  my understanding is that vita mix has dull blades that work for years  they do_not rely so_much on sharpness as they do on speed  the_other thing  in addition to heat  that you get with a vita mix is aeration  foam   which i_do_not notice with the ninja  my smoothies are full of fruit and veggies  so they are full of fiber  if you are okay with having some noticeable fiber in your blend over time  the ninja is a_great_deal at about 1 5 the_cost  if that matters to you  expect that you will have it in time  i started to notice it after about 25 blends   the blender cleans very easily and is simple to_use  i_ve never had to remove the top to tamp stuff down and i_use 3 cups of leafy greens like kale and arugula  as_well as whole carrots  celery  apples  and never have chunks  overall it s a_great machine  i_cannot rate longevity since_i_ve only had it 6 weeks  but so_far i_m very_pleased  update  it s january 2018  i owned the ninja about 3 months and ended up getting a vita mix  i still stand by my original review  but there is a difference  the ninja starts out pretty great  but then over time things do no blend as_well  i_drink 2 smoothies a day  one veggie  one fruit   so_i_use it a minimum of 2x a day  over time_i started calling my ninja smoothies   grainies   the blades start out very sharp  and the technology depends on that  but they dull with use and it shows in the results  the vita mix does_not depend on blade sharpness  but power  it pummels everything to pieces  itty bitty pieces   i am amazed at the flour i_can make with it  also  the heat i_mentioned is_not a factor but a feature  most things are blended in less_than a minute  35 seconds often   so nothing really gets warm unless you leave it on in order to generate heat  the ninja is a_good blender  especially for the_cost  but i_don_t think one can fairly compare it to a vita mix  it s like comparing apples and oranges  easy_to clean_and does the job  i_like the blender  it does the job but  i wish it blended things like spinach a_little bit more finely  the blades don_t quite get far enough_to the edge and little bits seem to escape the blades  this is a_very minor complaint  i also find it annoying that the lid needs to latch on while the blending is in progress  sometimes i_like to_add ingredients after the blending has commenced  my old blender had a removable center on the lid to_do just this and i_definitely miss that feature  on the positive  its so easy_to clean  the fact that the blade comes out makes all the difference in the world  i_love this blender i_love this blender  it s easy_to_use and easy_to clean  this is my first blender and i_didn_t_even have to read the instructions to figure out how to_use it  sometimes when it begins to blend  pieces of fruit vegetables stick to the glass  such as a spinach leaf  and you have to turn it off and push the piece of fruit vegetable back down to blend  but that s my only  issue  so_far  it creates smooth smoothies  i_ve been using it twice a day for two weeks now  impressive ice crusher and smoothie maker  just wish it was compatible with individual blending cups  we ve been battling our blender s ability to crush ice for years  since our kiddos are huge smoothie fans and we enjoy frozen drinks  we needed a blender that could get the job done without leaving chunks of ice and a metallic smell in the air  after reading the stellar reviews and watching the impressive ice crushing infomercial  we decided to invest in a ninja  when this particular model had a flash sale   53 49   we pulled the trigger  pros  1  it crushes ice and frozen fruit like a powerhouse  leaving no chunks behind  2  the blade design is brilliant  easy_to insert and remove with one fluid movement   just don_t forget to put blade in before blending   3  blade removal makes pouring  scraping  and cleaning easy   be careful  it s sharp   4  secured top system locks out leaks and splashes  5  flip spout allows small food items and liquid to be added while blending  6  has the ability to pulse or run blender hands free  7  holds a ton of liquid  great_for lots of people  cons  1  if not full  dry items  spinach  will jump to the top and stick to the sides requiring stopping and stirring manually  2  does_not pair with individual blending cups as recommended by amazon  3  cord is too short  difficult to accommodate to outlet  given the  54 price tag  this blender is well_worth the_money when entertaining and blending for groups  it gets the job done quickly_and efficiently and crushes ice like magic  cleanup is easy   simply rinse the extremely sharp blade and air dry on counter and throw the pitcher in the dishwasher  because of the excellent top lock feature and no openings on pitcher base  little to no residue gets on the base  i_love this blender  but if_i had it to_do all over again  i would bypass this model and order an all_in one ninja blender that has the option of using smaller cups for individual drinks  our smoothie blending would take much less time_if the area inside the pitcher cup was filled with more food liquid so that sides didn_t need_to be scraped of spinach  plus  we d have the added individual smoothie cups for our two children  allowing them to choose the ingredients inside  while they re battling over smoothie choices  my husband and i could enjoy blending frozen margaritas_in a bigger pitcher  amazon   please stop pairing it with the  tritan nutri ninja cups   they re not compatible with this_unit  bottom line  ninja packs a punch i_ve never seen with other blenders  it s my new brand of choice  blends nicely  but need_to be cautious with blade  we needed to_replace our old blender and i_didn_t want_to spend  300  on a blender  i was_impressed the_quality and the look of the blender as_well as the top locking lid which seems_to_do a_good job preventing any potential injuries  the_only concern i have is that the blade is very long  sharp and you have to be careful when you clean it  i would not recommend leaving this in the bottom of the sink drain  also  if you do need_to agitate whatever is in the blender  be careful not to stick your fingers in the pitcher and use the_back_of a wooden spoon or something similar  dangerous   powerful this is a_great   powerful blender  but    warning  the blades are insanely dangerous to clean  if you don_t have a dishwasher  you will slice open your fingers trying_to clean it  great smoothie maker this blender works_great_for smoothies from frozen fruit and also homemade sherbet using frozen fruit  the_only gripe i have about it is that it is a_bit challenging to clean the blades and lid  first the blades are very sharp so you have to be very careful to not cut yourself and the lid has a_lot of nooks and crannies  granted if you have a dishwasher this wouldn_t be as much of an issue  overall the blender fits my needs very_well_and i_did purchase the additional warranty from squaretrade so_i am covered if anything happens in the next couple_of years  which with daily use could easily happen  because_it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you     i_ve had a_few blenders over the years  there was a krups that was a wedding present and lasted about 15 years followed by a much nicer breville that lasted maybe 2 years total  it was the cheaper of the two similar models  but out_of the_box  i could tell that the motor was under powered  especially at it s higher settings  it smelled smoky  even new_and eventually it burned out  so  for it s replacement i landed here  didn_t want_to spend several hundred dollars  but went for wattage hp this time_and it shows  confidence inspiring and i_m sure will handle whatever i throw at it  i_make smoothies almost every day with frozen fruit and it handles with ease  the blades are crazy sharp and stack up through the pitcher and seem to pull the contents down  so everything gets crushed blended  the pitcher locks to the base and the lid locks down on the pitcher and the motor won_t run unless both are locked into place  i think this is a safety feature  because_it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you got them in there  the blade stack lifts out  which makes cleaning easy  after about a_month of moderate heavy use  i_m impressed and happy  this is a_very_good blender  
good_for this price point    i_purchased the ninja last week when i remembered i_didn_t have a blender at our vacation home  i_needed something_in a hurry and didn_t have time to shop  i am using it for my green smoothies  spinach kale  water  and some frozen fruit   i put the spinach kale and water in the ninja then liquify before adding the frozen fruit  ending up with a grainy drink with a shake like thickness  i_can_temporarily live with the graininess  though this may be a_problem for some  the blender container is large enough that i_can make a double serving with no problem  the blade is scary  but i handle it with the utmost care and so_far there have been no mishaps  the lid  container  and blade are extremely lightweight plastic and do_not seem sturdy  they are dishwasher safe  making clean up quick and easy  but i_ve noticed the hollow handle retains internal moisture that does_not dry in the course of the day  might lead to bacterial growth    overall this does_not_come anywhere close to the high end blender i have at home  i_don_t expect this blender to last very long  it arrived within 48 hours through amazon prime  was safely packaged  and as_described  i feel i_received what i would expect at this price point  but have already decided to purchase a_nicer blender before our next visit  it s ok  wouldn_t get again  my beloved  and expensive  breville recently broke  and after much researching  decided to_get this_as a replacement  the pitcher definitely feels and sounds cheap thin like it wants to break  i swear every time_i_use it  the ice cubes are going_to crack it  i_use it mostly for protein powder shakes after the gym  unfortunately the square shape means that powder gets in the corners and stays there  also  despite using every possible setting  i_can_t get it to blend the ice well  i always feel the need_to the shake a_bit as bigger ice chips always remain  i always hand wash  which is easy   yay  this immediately after using and after just a_month  condensation is collecting in the handle  not cool  i_do like the spout opening in the lid  which ensures that big blobs of shake or smoothie don_t make messes as you pour  this is an ok blender  but feels like it wants to break and i_m not impressed with its functionality  prob wouldn_t buy_again  just ok it worked well for the_first few months  but then the blades became very dull  we have a green smoothie every morning with lots of vegetables  the smoothies were becoming more and more  chunky  and hard to_get through even a huge smoothie straw  i_tried_to_get a replacement part but there are none for this model  since we realized that we are very committed to daily green smoothies  we ended up buying a vitamix and wow   what a huge difference  i never knew that you didn_t have to  chew  a green smoothie   the ninja never blended our smoothies to a puree consistency  the ninja is fine for some things  but it doesn_t compare to a vitamix  not good with chia flax seeds after my last blender died  everyone recommended a ninja  i just made my first shake and it unfortunately doesn_t grind up blend chia or flax seeds  the spinach and ice were blended fine  and it looks to be sturdy and built well  if you re not going_to be adding any seeds or small items like that i imagine you ll be fine  but i believe the_tower blades don_t catch them the_same way a traditionally structured blender does  it blends  but i wouldn_t buy it again i saw several reviews of this blender accompanied by pictures of lacerations  i_thought to myself   i_ve been using food processors and other kitchen tools that have sharp  removable blades for years with no_problems      well  i have managed to avoid any injuries  however i have more sympathy for those people than_i_did before for the following two reasons  1  the three tiers of blades mean that there is no safe way to dry this without blades sticking up in the air  unlike a knife or a food processor blade where you can lay it flat   standing it upright the_way it sits in the carafe will make it prone to tipping over  2  the top part where you must hold the blade is small  tapered  and difficult to grip firmly with wet hands  my other complaint is that because of the three tiered blade assembly  it is impossible to safely push things down into the blender  i_make smoothies five days a_week and the kale that i_used to just press down to the bottom so that other ingredients would fit  i now have to blend for a moment to_make room  not a huge chore  but it slows me down  i_don_t love the locking lid and i fear the plastic moving parts will break before the blender wears out  but i_ve been using this several days a_week for five months and that s still working fine  bottom line  it blends reliably  i_m not going_to_replace it  but i wouldn_t buy it again  not suitable for all uses this blender is absolutely excellent if you exclusively use it to blend whole pieces of fruit and veggies  personally i_make a_lot of smoothies with items such as yogurt and protein powder added in  the trouble is it has this very long three bladed pillar that extends almost all the_way to the lid from the bottom  if you are trying_to_add in a powder or something like yogurt  it catches on all the blades  which means that unless you planned to fill the blender all the_way to the top  that stuff won_t make it into your smoothie and will instead stick and you have to scrape it in and blend again  also_it s ridiculously powerful even on the low setting  which again isn_t good if you only want_to_make less_than maximum capacity  since_it splatters everywhere and you either lose a_lot  or have to sit there and scrape it all out with a spatula  overall it s just a_lot of trouble unless you are using it to full capacity every time  
i_m disappointed because because we cant seem to ave the option     my mom had got one_of these blenders and it had gotten four symmetrical cracks in all four bottom of the plastic container causing it to leak  thinking we stored it wrong causing the cracks we bought another  not more_than the two weeks we had the new_one simply crushing ice had put the_same identical four cracks in the new blender  i_m disappointed because because we cant seem to ave the option to_return either blenders  which are now useless  its a shame because the blenders worked_great other_than the cracking feature  file    c  users jacob downloads img 0742 jpg nice blender but      i_ve been using this blender for 5 months and worked_great  super powerful blender with nice design  but  the plastic jar since to be made of a poor quality plastic because_it cracked while blending  i_use the blender around 4 to 5 times a_week  i only blend fruits and i_don_t_even use ice  i_ve been trying_to contact the_seller but not answer  phone just keep ringing  i_m very_disappointed for what it could have been a_great machine  poor quality  updating my review 1 5 years after purchase  i_loved my blender  but it literally broke into pieces after only a year and change  a_few months after i_got it  a crack started to form and eventually just broke wide open  keep in mind  i only used this to_make smoothies  it wasn_t heavily used or anything  i_m so disappointed  my thrift store blender lasted longer than this  i expect much more for this price  pitcher cracks too easily the blender is fine  but the pitcher keeps cracking  almost immediately  i had a replacement pitcher sent after a_month of use  and the_first time_i_use the replacement there was a crack forming  it took a_few weeks or so for the corner to completely break off  and more cracks are forming around the base still  i reached out to ninja and i would have to pay  64 for a 2nd replacement  which seems crazy since this is clearly a defect  i_m only using this to_make smoothies with frozen blueberries and bananas mostly  so there should be no reason that this keeps happening  disappointing  not worth the_cost  was really looking_forward to_getting this blender as_i heard so many people rave about their ninja blenders and i_wanted a_nice one to_make fruit smoothies with on a regular basis  i was pretty disappointed with this_one  pros    blades easily remove to_make pouring and cleaning easy   nice pour spout on lid  don_t have to remove lid to pour    chops ice well cons    because the blades are in the middle  i find that some food items i put in just get pushed out to the sides and stick there instead_of getting blended in no matter how long i let it blend  i have to open up_and scrape the food off the sides to ensure that it all gets mixed together and there are no chunks  even when i add more liquid in the mixture  this continues to be an issue    does_not chop up things like pomegranate seeds  included in one_of the frozen berry mixes i buy_from costco  no matter how long i blend it  i end up chewing on whole seeds every time so_i have started buying a different berry mixture so_i_don_t have to worry about seeds but i shouldn t have to_do that  i wish i could return this and use the_money towards a higher quality blender  because_i hate this blender so_much this is the_first time my three young children are all napping in the afternoon  of all the  many many  things i could be doing right now  i chose to write this review  because_i hate this blender so_much  let s count the_ways  shall we  1  the blade and blade holder is huge and does_not allow larger chunks of fruit or vegetables to be placed inside the container  2  the blades are all placed on the side  and none_in the center bottom of the blade holder  meaning there is no centrifugal force  meaning that the blades scatter the components of your smoothie all over the container  instead_of towards the center bottom of the container  this means that you cannot open the lid to_add more liquid or fruit as_it is blending  3  the blades are not locked into place and fall out when you pour 4  it is unnecessarily loud  heavy  and clunky  5  it does_not blend properly  it is about as effective as a mortar and pestle  so_in the spirit of fairness  i gave this_thing two_stars as_it does sort of blend things and if you want_to_use it to_make fruit smoothies  i suppose it does the job  however  if you want_to_make any creamy soups  vegetable smoothies  or sauces you are better off with a regular  30 oster  my cheap blender does a more thorough job and gets less dirty  i finally thought i was rid of this nightmare when it  after only a year  with maybe bi weekly use  it crapped out on me  the manufacturer offered to send me a_new motor  but i was to pay the  30 shipping  thanks but no thanks  verdict  not_even as_good as a cheap blender  does kind of blend  customer_service is laughable pros  easy_to_use  cleans easy in dishwasher  blends thoroughly  safe locking starting mechanism cons  ninja customer_service is a joke if something fails  weak pitcher latch on ours broke 45 days after purchase   was told a replacement pitcher was  65  warranty was only valid if purchased directly from them and only covered the motor base  lid and pitcher are not  no 60 day guarantee or years warranty  doesn_t put the  smooth  in  smoothie  if you re interested in making green smoothies like i am  you might want_to look elsewhere  even on the highest setting  my smoothie  kale  banana  apple  and 2  milk  is chunky and chewy  see picture   seeing a_video review comparing this blender to the kitchenaid 5 speed diamond blender has convinced me that if_i want_to put the  smooth  in  smoothie   i_need_to_get the latter  which is ostensibly quieter and blends veggies very_well  will be returning this_one tomorrow  cracked and leaking after less_than a_month s use i was very_happy_with this blender when i first tried it  i have always had 20 dollar blenders so this was a step up because_it is much more powerful  i_make smoothies and blend cauliflower for mash sometimes  but the primary reason for purchase was to_make bulletproof coffee every morning  upon first use for bp coffee it produced froth like i have never had and it was truly delicious  the reason i landed on this blender is because after doing research for the_best blender specifically for bp coffee this was recommended if you are not willing to splurge for a vitamix or blendtec  at this point  i_may have to_do that  because even this blender has already cracked and is leaking after less_than a_month s use  luckily i am still in the return frame for amazon so they are sending me a_new_one  i also purchased warranty   upon doing more research  people say in order to keep blenders from cracking when making bp coffee  you must release the air pressure out_of the blender by taking off the top after no more_than blending for 10 seconds  then you can put the top back on and blend for additional time_if needed  i am going_to try this method  and hopefully it will keep it from cracking  
blender jar exploded  i_ve had my ninja for about 18 months  i_loved it  used primarily for smoothies with frozen fruit  the_other day it exploded on me and tore a hole through it  i have contacted ninja  they didn_t seem too concerned about it  and when i pressed them and offered to send them the defective blender jar so they could figure out the defect  they didn_t seem very interested  the email they gave me was_incorrect so_i have to call them again to try and pursue this  i_don_t want another_one  i just want them check it out because obviously there is an issue  poor plastic  broke within 8 months with little usage  do_not recommend  costly warranty  bought on october 6  2016  one_of the clip that locks the lid on broke off after minimal usage  the broken clip prevents the blender lid from locking and deactivating the safety  rendering the blender useless  their warranty states that i will have to pay  19 95 to cover the_cost of returning a replacement  factor in the_cost to ship the broken blender to them  that would be 40 45  of the original purchase price  i would not recommend this blender  stick with glass container versus plastic  broke after three uses after three uses a crack developed along the bottom of the pitcher from one end to the_other  the_only_thing_i ever blended was fruit  their warranty states that i will have to pay  19 95 for shipping to have it replaced  at 20  of the_purchase price  i_don_t_even know_if_it s worth it  based on my experience  i_do_not recommend this blender  piece of  s ierra  h otel  i ndia  t ango nice concept however  the entire operations and use comes down to a improperly designed and fragile tab that is easy_to break off and renders the blender useless  after the fact  i have read this is a common problem with the blender  see red light blinks   now_i have a 1000watt paper weight  i_purchased the extended warranty from square trade via amazon and the just referred me to the manufacture  not what i_expected  will not purchase from manufacture again  amazon  you let me down  the blender that cracks and breaks when you wash it in a dishwasher  yikes i_bought this blender as_i_thought this would be a solid blender to_make my smoothies  boy was_i wrong  i am an avid juicer  and normally also love smoothies  when i_bought this blender i was_not trying_to chop up onions or anything hard and crazy just making a shake and something easy_to clean  however after 2 3 washes in the dishwasher i saw a crack and on top of the crack i also saw this blender leak all over my counter  its disgusting and time consuming to clean the actual blender for all the droplets of my smoothie and it just makes a huge mess  if you want a solid blender this is_not the_one guys look for a glass blender  zero stars   leaked after only 6 weeks of use if_i could leave zero stars i would  we purchased this to_make bullet proof coffee  and that is all it was used_for in the six weeks we had it in our possession  we used it twice daily for 6 weeks to blend coffee with butter and mct oil  we blended for a maximum of 60 seconds each time we used it  we never used ice in the_machine while we owned it  after only six weeks  it began leaking at the base where the blade attaches  there was no way for us to tighten anything  for the amount of money we paid for it  this was a huge disappointment   professional     yeah right    this is_not a professional blender  pros  it blended our contents quickly_and efficiently  albeit  it was only coffee and butter  other cons  the carafe is plastic  not glass  i knew this when i_ordered it  but i just cannot understand what s so hard about making a blender that is made with glass and metal  i owned an oster for 20 years and it was awesome until the blade started to leak  and when we replaced it  the  oem part  cracked within 2 months  they just don_t make appliances like they use to 20 years ago  also  this blender is huuuuuuge  it wouldn_t_even fit under my cabinets  so_i had to leave the carafe off and sit it to the side  taking up twice as much of my counter top space  also  it s very loud  but most blenders are  we never had any issues_with the blade  flying out at us  like one review we read  you just have to be careful when pouring  which is where the spot comes in handy  or remove the blade to pour your contents  would i purchase it again or recommend this_product  absolutely not  i had the option to exchange it  but if an appliance can show that kind of poor design after only 6 weeks  i_don_t want anything to_do with it  we went back to an oster    with a glass carafe  and so_far it s working_great    lasted one month  cracked and broken  leaks  this lasted about a_month before the pitcher cracked on the bottom and started leaking  also  one_of the black plastic feet on the pitcher broke off  this blender is ridiculously awful worst blender absolutely the worst blender i have ever purchased  i_used it all_of three times and the light wouldn_t stop flashing even though i had it aligned properly  i called customer_service and they were absolutely useless  turns out that_even though the blender says dish washer safe you can only put it on the top shelf which doesn_t make sense because_it s too big to fit on any standard dishwashers top shelf  apparently a piece on the jug melted off in the dishwasher  needless to_say i am never buying one_of their products again  poor quality construction  the blender jar cracked and leaks after just 1 and half months of light use  it was_not dropped or slammed  just cracked by the spinning part at the bottom  very dissapointed  read before you buy  warranty info  i_wanted to really like this_product based on all the positive reviews i read  i_bought it in august  and now_it s november and the pitcher has cracked  i_used it may be once a_week to blend smoothies  the pitcher is_not covered by their 1 year warranty  which is ridiculous  like it s an extra part or something  to_return the_product you have to pay  19 99  is it worth it  you decide for yourself  hate it  so let me start by saying that     hate it  so let me start by saying that i had a real ninja before this_one  i_dropped it and broke it so here i go and purchase this_one for a_great_deal  unfortunately when this blender arrived and from the very first time_i_used it  once_i turn it on to blend the contents splash out through the top  i_guess the lid doesnt fit properly or maybe its the rubber on the lid that isnt good  either way in order for it not to splash out  i_need_to tightly hold down the lid while it blends  and when its time to pour  im supposed to easily lift the corner and pour  however when i pour it comes pouring out around the whole lid making a huge mess  i have to remove the entire lid and blade in order to free pour  big waste of my money and time  but this is such a horrible blender for what you pay i never write reviews  but this is such a horrible blender for what you pay  i had to write a review  another reviewer wrote it takes the smooth out_of smoothie and he couldnt be more right  im not_sure how this blender got so many good reviews  so many times i_tried making my smoothies and aa bowls and had to stick a spoon in the blender and push all the chunks to the center because they wouldnt blend  i end up dumping my smoothie into my nitribullet to_get all the chunks out_of it  the designers went wrong when they decided to put three sets of blades going up   all it does is send everything flying to the sides  making me have to constantly scrape the sides of the blender  the lowest setting is still too high  ugh  i_need a vitamix  stopped working after 6 months not_even 6 months old  only used maybe 10 times  stoped working  power button blinks but nothing works  i have all the arrows lined up  everything on right  nothing  went online and so many people bought this blender have same problem  waste of money  no stars for me worst blender ever as someone else mentioned in their review  this blender takes the  smooth  out_of  smoothie   no matter how long i blend  there are still massive chunks in my  smoothie   and it s nearly undrinkable  look at the variety of user uploaded photos and you ll see what i_mean  also  this blender was shipped in it s original box  with no discreet packaging whatsoever  so the whole neighborhood  including potential thieves  knew exactly what it was as_it sat on my front porch  it also means that the_box i have to_return it in  the original packaging  is already beat up from shipping the_first time  i honestly have no idea how this blender has been so popular  it is the worst blender i have ever used  including other cheaper blenders  
the quintessential blender just bought this inexpensive blender for my bro because his old one broke  pros    sturdy and made from strong metal and plastic   32oz is a_great amount of space for blending opportunities   the two 16oz jars are convenient sizes for smaller blends   simple on and off buttons anyone could use   fast_and durable blade that cuts through even the most unyielding fruit   sleek design and fashionable color scheme   easy_to clean   extremely affordable cons    travel lids could have been built to be more secure   pouring from the 32oz into another cup is_not as smooth as_it could be overall  fantastic blender especially at such a low price point  it outperforms blenders that are two or three times as expensive and carries out the basic functions smoothly  great_for families  this is my favorite blender yet  we make a_lot of smoothies   milkshakes but the kids like different flavors than the adults do  i_make the kids shakes in the 32 oz  my husband s protein shake in the 16oz and my fruit smoothie in the_other 16oz  thanks to the versatility of this awesome blender set now_i_can easily make everybody s shakes and smoothies in minutes  we use this all the_time_and absolutely love it  excellent smoothie mixer for the_price    awesome for what it is    a cost effective smoothie mixer  please don_t buy this thinking you re getting a top of the line food processor or juicer for a bargain  it s_not designed for that  i_love using it for protein or fruit yogurt smoothies  chops up ice relatively well if you do the cubes a_few at a time when there s liquid  i_ve been using this_thing every day for the past couple_of months and no_issues so_far  cleans up super easy as_well  super blender great  smaller blender for folks who don_t need bells and whistles  smooth operation  great function  and i_ve made great use of the mini cups for smaller jobs  doesn_t take a_lot of room on the counter  and has a_nice sleek  modern look  definitely worth the_money  found the perfect smoothie maker just what i_wanted  i have a smaller blender that does about two cups at a time  and i have had bigger blenders that are just too big and heavy with the thick glass pitchers  this is perfect  we make smoothies and milkshakes for the kids  one at a time  if tastes vary  or mix a_few in the bigger pitcher  we really love the option of blending in the  take with you  cups  a_good_purchase  i actually love this blender  proud owner of a vitamix here  i_needed something a_little smaller as the vitamix takes up a_lot of counter space  this little guy is awesome  i would not suggest use all frozen fruits to_make a smoothie with this  its_not powerful enough  i_defrosted my fruits for my smoothie and i_used a_couple frozen fruit pieces to substitute for ice  with a scoop of natures bounty vitamin and protein mix  it was smooth and delicious  also this little guy doesnt make that much noise  works_great  very convenient  this is an awesome little blender  i_make smoothies in it just about every day  make sure that you re adding enough liquid  and use pulse to chop up frozen fruit ice  sometimes when i blend in the cup i have to_take it off the blender and give it a_little shake to move stuff around  but it s_not a big deal to_do so  awesome blender  since everything come apart awesome blender  since everything come apart  it s really easy_to clean  and it s useful for not only blended drinks  but also making pesto and the like  we use it near daily  so_it gets washed a_lot  the_only_thing_i would caution someone on is that i wouldn_t put it in the dishwasher  even though it says top rack safe  after unfortunate incidents with another blender and some plastic cups    i wouldn_t recommend doing that  and i_m so happy i_did my son and i have been on a  smoothie kick  lately  so_i_purchased this  stay or go  blender  and i_m so happy i_did  we ve been using it every day  sometimes twice a day  for about a_week  it works_great_with frozen fruit  as long as you add enough liquid   and clean up is a breeze  love the options of the pitcher and or  to_go  cups  as_well     we use both  it s much more quiet than my former blender     which is great  i highly_recommend this_product to anyone who makes smoothies  great  cheap  blender great little blender  love that it has the different containers  i_can assemble 3 smoothies at a time  which works_great_for the toddlers   it is_not very powerful  if you want_to mix up greens you will have to let it blend  blend  blend  if_i_use ice  i_use the crushed ice from the ice maker to give it a head start  as a previous reviewer said  it s a  small footprint  on the counter and that s great_for smaller kitchen or limited counter space  overall  it s a_nice  cheap   small blender and works_well for our needs        been using the blender for basic smoothies and i_love it  i_ve put ice cubes and frozen fruit     i_ve been using the blender for basic smoothies and i_love it  i_ve put ice cubes and frozen fruit in and haven_t had a_problem  i would highly_recommend  but can_t attest to more complex blending ingredients  good basic blender  okay  so this is a simple blender for simple easy jobs  don_t think that in purchasing this that you are getting some super high powered blender  in my house  we use it to_make our smoothies  it does the job  takes a_bit of_time but  for the_price  it s a_good blender  i_do think that next time  i will go for something with more power  sleek blender love my blender  use it for protein shakes  milkshakes  smoothies  you name it  would suggest doing a quick pulse before just blending a_lot of foods  i_like the add ons that come_with the blender     2 years ago for making smoothies and it worked_great_for my husband and i i_bought this 2 years ago for making smoothies and it worked_great_for my husband and i  eventually the spinner got worn out so_i_bought a_new_one  for the_price it does a_great job and i_like that it comes_with so many pieces      really have the funds and this little blender works perfect  we do protein smoothies twice a day with     we wanted a ninja but didn_t really have the funds and this little blender works perfect  we do protein smoothies twice a day with it and it ll blends frozen fruit  ice and the powder perfectly  with all those extra jars

worth your money  reliable brand  powerful motor   best for milk shakes i was looking_for some lightweight blender which can chop onions  make salsa and milk shakes  this blender is one_of the cheapest ones yet have all sort of fancy attachments  looks good_and have a powerful  650  watt motor  negative   only one single speed option and pulse  there could be at least one more option for speed may be at half speed   travel cup to_go flask s lid is_not convenient to drink  it is practically of no use and i rather drink it straight out_of the 16oz cup    no more usage and washing of other cups glasses      really small capacity  but in this price with so many attachments  it has to be small   plastic container looks_like cheaply made and seems like it may break easily  however mine is working fine so_far   i_don_t like the orientation design of blades  only two levels  one_of the bottom blade could be fixed at centre  i_ve seen so_in some other blenders  there is considerable gap and can leave small pieces untouched  i wish in listing they would have uploaded the picture of blades  never mind i am attaching in my review for all other buyers     lid for 32oz jar is_not tight enough  it just fits it but not like air tight or spill free  positive   powerful motor 650 watt motor  peak speed   one single option for speed which is top speed   probably most powerful in this price segment   several fancy attachments   although orientation of blades is_not good_but motor is powerful enough_to move the most of the content   lightweight  yet powerful   absolutely perfect_for shakes   for anything else it does the job but not good enough   priced right   cheap for number of attachments provided   little bit of quality compromised in plastic but still good enough  bpa free plastic jars conclusion  if your primary purpose is making milk shakes  don_t think twice  its the_best deal  although the travel cup s cap is_not designed to travel  the mouth have no lid and is kind of inconvenient to drink  cheap price  reliable brand  light weight            update on 17th december  after heavy use of 1 5 year  this blender gave up  used_for milk shakes almost everyday  ps  if this review was helpful to you in anyway then please vote  yes helpful  a_great machine_for all kinds of drinks  lots of power  small size  well integrated cups  we love this_machine  we wanted to_get a second cup for a previous h b blender  but they were  8   this turned out to be so cheap i_bought it instead   we paid about  22  it seems_to have gone up since then  but look around for another listing on_amazon   one_of us is on a liquid diet  so_it gets used several times a day  we are now drinking lots of fruit smoothies  likes  well integrated blending drinking cups  three sizes as shown in the pictures  plus a regular 32 oz  blender cup  overall small footprint on the counter  we keep it on the counter and never have to_get out our full sized blender since 32 oz is plenty  many clever design touches  including the_way the blade goes on the open end for mixing  then comes off for drinking  it comes_with 2 large  sippy cup  lids  plus one lid that can be opened or closed for travel  very_easy_to remove from the blender briefly to_add more ingredients or give it a shake  the containers seem to be a_very sturdy plastic  no bpa  as long as you clean them immediately after use  a jet of warm water is enough although we use a bottle brush  lots of power  unlike its predecessor   400 watts i think  i would not run it for 2 minutes straight  but 45 seconds is no problem  plenty_of power to chop frozen fruit or anything else   see below about full sized ice cubes   good design of the switch  you can easily blip it for a_few seconds  or turn it on and let it run  the parts assemble and disassemble very quickly  with no way to put them together wrong  except see below about the  coupling    flaws  the biggest problem is the high aspect ratio of the two big drinking cups   meaning  tall and thin   this makes them harder to clean   the bottom of the cup won_t get clean in a dishwasher  i understand why they did it   the small diameter is needed to keep the  footprint  of the blender small  we bought a  4 bottle brush which is perfect_for cleaning them and solves the_problem  the small cup does_not have this problem   they should provide two small and one large  instead_of vice versa  the high aspect ratio also sometimes leads to poor circulation between the top and bottom when blending  be sure to leave a one_inch bubble inside  so you can remove it and give it a quick shake  when we first got it  we sometimes failed to push the cup down far enough on the base  the result was rapid erosion of the coupler between the blades and the base   details of the design are tedious   it makes sense once you see it   so_far this has_not caused any problem  minor safety flaw  the switch is very_easy_to trigger accidentally  there is no  completely off  setting other_than unplugging  for the most part the design is very safe as the blades are completely inaccessible while it s mixing  however you can put the blades onto the base without any cup   there s no reason you would want_to  but i_did it once when we first got it   in that situation  it is dangerous since a momentary touch of the hair trigger switch will start the blades and shred anything they touch  like fingers  in short  i would have preferred a safety interlock that prevents the motor from running unless everything_is in the right place  tips  use crushed ice  if you must use full sized cubes  take care that they don_t jam the blades  order of ingredients matters  frozen ingredients go in the top  so when you blend they are on the bottom  keep the overall mixture liquid enough  for example  add milk in addition to yoghurt  i suspect with 90  greek yoghurt  it would never mix the top and the bottom  overall  we love it and use it constantly  as mentioned  i_d like to give it 5_stars  but the tall aspect ratio requires several adjustments to deal with  most of the reviews are on point  still a_great blender  been using it a while now  the blender is pretty powerful  but  if you hold it down for more_than 2 3 seconds  there is a burning smell  if_i fill it up to the top  i have to shake the ingredients between pulses  but with enough liquid  i_use milk   i find i_don_t have too much of a_problem  if you use yogurt  i found any more yogurt than 50 50 really taxed the motor  great_product i_love this blender  i_use the blade for both the larger cup but also the individual bottles  i_didn_t realize it was only one speed  but i only use it for smoothies so_i_don_t mind  it cleans easily  i_ve left stuff in it for days before and it still cleans quickly_and easily  i_love it  and i_thought it was a decent price  great blender  just one small critique  this blender set is great_for the_price  the motor is strong enough_to shred through ice without skipping a beat  and the contents mixes throughout down to the blades no problem  the bottle containers easily transition from the blender attachment  screwed onto the top  to the bottle easily  by just screwing on the bottle attachment  the cheese grader works as_expected  and can_turn whole parmesan into shredded parmesan in a matter of seconds  i also use the blender to_make frozen drinks  or for protein shakes if_i am mixing more_than one  my old blender  a ninja  would have this issue where the protein powder would get stuck to the sides and not actually mix into the drink  for whatever reason  perhaps the shape of the bottle or the size of the interior relative to the motor  this doesn_t happen with my hamilton beach stay or go blender  pros  strong motor  easy_to_use and convenient attachments  easy_to clean  multiple bottle containers make for convenient access  cons  only one speed  i personally don_t mind though   with a  pulse  and an  on  setting  the tops for the drink containers do_not have a valve to let air circulate into the bottle while you drink  creating a suction problem  i fixed this problem by drilling a tiny hole into the top with my smallest drill bit  and it now works 100  to satisfaction  though it would be nice if this was done by the manufacturer  good_but loud the multiple sizes make this a_great_product  my only problem is it s loud like really loud  go far it has worked like a charm for blended coffee  fruit smoothie  cream soup  and homemade pasta sauce  very_pleased great_for smoothies best used_for making smoothies  not really good to be used as a standard  blender  because_it just is_not strong enough  but as a smoothie maker i rate it 100   that was my purpose for buying this_product to_make smoothies  so all is good  i_do recommend this_product for smoothies and a_great_price  thank you good blender i waited a_few months to review this blender  i really wanted to_see how it did first  i have to_say i_m impressed  i_make a_lot of smoothies using ice and frozen fruits and it blends them well  the_only_thing_is it will leave a_little pulp or crushed seeds  for the_price though compared to some very high end blenders its definitely worth it  i also love that it came_with two large travel cups and one smaller with shaker lid  definitely recommend worth a_lot more_than the_price ok for the_price you might think it s a dud or a cheapie but no  buy it  i have been making smoothies and it blends through oats and ice and whole almost easily  today i_made carrot ginger apple juice  all are very fibrous and it made easy change out_of it  you will not be disappointed  price is great  wish it would have came_with closed lids     price is great  wish it would have came_with closed lids for taking the cups on the go  only comes_with lids with open holes in them  works very_well so long as you don_t have too     works very_well so long as you don_t have too much in the well for the motor and blades to handle   then it can get a_bit hot and you can definitely tell by the smell  the parts are a_bit hard to clean  but being dishwasher safe definitely helps  good buy_for the_price but won_t blend ice on the_first try great_with all the attachments but you ll rarely use the small shaker thing cause it s just too small  i_use it to blend up fruit smoothies with ice and i constantly have to_take it off the stand and shake it up by hand then put it back on  great_buy_for the_price but you ll have to_do some of the work yourself  this is a_good vendor for its price this is a_good vendor for its price  works_well  unless you want_to blend the ingredients very very finely  this will do the job  plus you can blend your shake directly into the mugs   glasses that come_with the blender and it makes everything so_much convenient  powerful and easy_to clean powerful and easy_to clean  4 stars because the tumblers aren t very_easy_to drink out_of  and leak when closed  i_use it for blending frozen fruit okay product i_bought to_make me shakes from frozen fruit and it works pretty_good_for the_price  great blender this blender has been great so_far  i_use it to_make protein shakes before i go to_work in the morning and it is quick and blends everything perfectly  the_only down side is the travel bottles don_t close  there is just an opening for drinking or for a straw  but as long as you are not planning on sealing it up_and drinking it later it works just_fine  flimsy but functional  cheap plastic  the mixing jar is a_bit flimsy  but it does what it is supposed to_do  large blades are easy_to clean  it was great while it lasted it was great while it lasted  we used this to_make smoothies for breakfast almost every morning for 6 months until the motor died  
i_ve used it many times and still like it it s compact which is nice  since_i have very little counter space  but it can get a_little noisy  so no late night smoothies  what made me choose this_one was the individual sippy cups that blend right on the base  now_i_can make a single size smoothie  also clean up is pretty easy  but i had to_buy a long bristled cleaner to_get the crevices because_i couldn_t get my hands in there  cheap bushings   very powerful motor   just smaller than we thought  after 8 months it s leaking on bottom where the chopper is at   the ceramic washer fell apart an it s really loose   contacted seller an they said i had to_go thru manufacture  i have a backup 1 that s a hamilton beach that s 10 yrs old an doesn_t leak   the_only reason we ordered new 1 is because_it had a small tear on lid   don_t buy this 1   not very powerful not a full sized blender  not very powerful either but it does the trick for smoothies  i feel like the motor is going_to_go out pretty quick though  wish i would have spent a_little more and got something else but im making it work as long as_i_can  lids don_t close  the blender is better_than average for the_price  ive had it for a year and it s still running strong   but the stupid cups it comes_with don_t have lids that close  they are permanently open  even the_one with a twisty top  pictured ont he smallest cup in the image  is completely insecure  so don_t_even think about  go  ing anywhere with those    good_for smoothies without ice if you think ahead it s ok i_can do a_few things i_got it for but it seems_to leek really easily and jams even on partially thawed frozen bananas the travel cups are an absolute amazing bonus with this item however the blades suck and     i_bought this because_i_needed a blender  the travel cups are an absolute amazing bonus with this item however the blades suck and it really doesn_t blend ice or things like the_way i_expected it too  
it exploded i_ve had this blender for under a_month and use it to_make smoothies  this morning  i was making my smoothie like usual  the blender started making weird noises  smoke started coming out from under it  and then weird pieces of burnt plastic started flying out from it  this was a_great little blender for about 3 months when we used     this was a_great little blender for about 3 months when we used it for primarily fresh  softly frozen or almost thawed fruits and yogurt  frozen fruit with yogurt and milk killed it  absolutely burned up the motor and filled our house with a stinky burning smell   i am disappointed in this_product and will not_buy another  very small  the  large  part of the blender is very small  contents do_not fill a mason jar  i_wanted it because the thought of being able_to_take the portable cups was appealing  i would return it  but the_box got thrown away  there is also only one button option  not very_happy_with this not very_happy_with this  i_thought the to_go cups would be nice but it doesn_t make up for the loss of power  it left ice cube chunks as_well as chunks of frozen strawberries in my smoothies  kind of defeats the purpose of a smoothie so_it is super easy_to spill them it doesn_t blend very_well_and the lids of the cups don_t have a way to close  the holes are open   so_it is super easy_to spill them it would be nice if there was an adjustment to blend the cups themselves instead_of using the big blender to pour into the cups  refund was quick and fast  was a_good blender while it worked  but just quite turning on one day  i_used every day but only for 2 weeks then it quite  returned for full refund  bought a different kind  so_far no_problems  i_m sure it s a fine blender  but who wants to deal with all     i_m sure it s a fine blender  but who wants to deal with all these pieces  it doesn_t fit a mason jar as someone_indicated in the questions  and it comes_with a ton of varying sized plastic containers  the main blender part is weirdly small   maybe enough for two big smoothies  i_m returning it  the cups are a_nice add on you get what you pay_for  the blender doesnt mix well unless you add alot of water  the cups are a_nice add on  but the lids leak  i_ve been using this for a_month for shakes in the morning and it takes forever to blend properly  next time_id just invest in a decent blender  good luck with this blender good luck with this blender  if you put ice in it it basically clogs up  it doesnt blend worth a crap  you get what you pay_for on this_product  two_stars it s a decent little machine_for the_price  tends to over heat and smoke if your not careful  
really disappointed    got this to_make smoothies and after adding the fruit and liquid i turned on the blender and it made noise but didn_t really blend anything  i added more liquid and moved everything around with a spoon and turned it back on but it still only cut through what was on the bottom  i think it was peaches  but nothing else really happened  i finally added even more liquid and still it didn_t blend the fruit  i wish when i_bought this that i had tried it sooner so_i could have sent it back but i was_in the middle of moving and just got to try it recently  it has been sitting in my cabinet unused since then and we already got a different blender to_use instead  i_know hamilton beach makes great_products but this_one just isn_t one_of them  do_not use dangerous if making more_than one the cups are awesome but pointless since motor burned out a_month after having it and we only used it for making smoothies which we love but only had maybe three times and there s 4 of us so the two to_go cup_and the pitcher   2 servings  perfect_for my family except that it burned out when making the last smoothie  i had to grab it by the cord and chucked it outside in the snowbank cause it was smoking so bad i was worried it would actually burst into flames  luckily no one got hurt except my pride since now_i_m the mother who can burn smoothies  probably fine if only making one but what if_it would have done this to one_of the kids they might not have acted quick enough could have started house on fire poorly made i just got my blender this week went to open and use it for the_first time  and there was black stuff coming out_of the bottom  the bottom is poorly made it came apart the_first time_i_used it and got my counter top super dirty  i included a picture  terrible blender i_ve used this about 5 times  i was making herbalife  which is just powder  smoothies with it  it first started to smoke after the 2nd use  i  d turn off the blender  rearrange the device  stir it   try again  i_thought if_it could crush ice  like advertised   it could blend frozen fruit  along with regular fruit with no problem  it s overheated so badly  that it just stopped working  i_ve had it no longer than a_few month  very_disappointed in this_product   going_to be looking_for a_new model   brand for my next purchase  wouldn_t advise wasting your money on it  cheaply made and broke after 7 weeks of use  do_not recommend    a friend and i_ordered these right after christmas to mix up our protein shakes and one already broke  was smoking last night  i noticed when i_use mine  it also smells hot  we are only mixing a cup of crushed ice and plenty_of liquids so not putting a_lot of stress on the_machine  the window has closed for return so very_disappointed  i_do_not recommend this_product  i_guess you get what you pay_for  as cheap as you d expect    the blender struggles to blend the simplest items  even a yogurt based drink takes multiple minutes and leaves your kitchen smelling like burnt rubber  every time_i want_to_use the blender  i have to shake the whole thing as_i blend and must continually tighten the base  because the vibrations will loosen the fit and cause a major mess   the motor is also very loud  i_m a college student and require thrifty purchases  but this is a waste of money  do yourself a favor and spend the extra  30  one_star this_thing came broken and started sounding weird  smoke was coming out update  order a different one and got cancel by amazon  because there was none left  i order a_new_one_of this thinking maybe the_first one was defective   wronggg    this_thing_is loud  makes noises that im afraid its going_to break  i_did a banana a frozen strawberries smoothie and i felt like i put rocks inside that were destroying it  smell like its burning  start shaking strangely  im not giving this another chance  im returning it asap and don_t_even look back  wouldn_t recommend or purchase again  i_bought this to_make smoothies  and the_first two came out great  but when attempting to_make the third  consecutive days  not all on one day   the motor started smoking and almost started a fire in my kitchen  i_did_not overload it or use anything different in the smoothies  it was such a huge disappointment and waste of money  not worth you    bucks   invest in something more powerful and something that lasts worked well to start with but it lasted for 3 months only  over it  looks_like the_company  hamilton beach  will take some time to respond to my complaint as_it has been a_couple_of days now  the_product had a warranty of 3 years but the_company s ignorance after just 3 months is kinda turning me off                  reducing rating to 1 star as all efforts to reach customer support have been in vain for last 4 days  thank god that we have amazon backing it for us    leaks from the bottom after 2 months initially really liked this blender because_it was easy_to_make my smoothie in the to_go cup_and head out the door  however  after using daily for two months  it has started leaking from the bottom  doesn_t matter whether i_use the cup or the larger assembly    i_thought i_might not be tightening it enough so_i was extra careful to_make sure the seal was tight but the_same thing happens when my husband uses it  disappointed this_product worked_great_for all_of 3 days  i_received my package on friday  march 3rd  in the afternoon  on saturday morning i_made a berry smoothie and it worked_great  the_same happened for monday and tuesday  on wednesday morning while making my peach and mango smoothie  the motor started smoking and the smell of burning plastic permeated my house  i am extremely disappointed as_i have had several hamilton beach products and they all worked just_fine  unfortunately i would not purchase this_product again  it didn_t blend well for me    i_m doing the green smoothie cleanse and the ingredients needed to_make several of the smoothies would not all blend in the blender  due to being to small  i had to blend the ingredients in 2 parts and then mix together  due to some ingredients_not being broken down  processed i e   frozen strawberries and bananas  the cups  smoothie containers were efficient  however if a lid or cover for the opening would be better for travel  had to purchase a different smoothie  blender due to the longer process in the morning of having to blend the ingredients in batches  then together  i never thought that someday i will give a negative     i never thought that someday i will give a negative feedback to a product that amazon sells  i_received the_product today and just opened the_box_and pluged it  i just press the on button once to blender my shake and pofff  product burned instantly and never worked again  i couldnt used this_product_even once  please do_not_buy this blender in any circumstances  i_ve never seen that much low quality product in my life  this blender was completely disappointing  its cheap  not     this blender was completely disappointing  its cheap  not just in price but in quality  everything_is plastic  you can find other blenders for the_same price that everything_is glass and its going_to be a_lot more durable  it broke when it tried_to blend the ice for a smoothie  so on the second time_i_used it it broke  not durable for smoothies  piece of junk     absolutely awful  first one we ordered arrived with a rattle sound  turns out the motor was already broken into pieces before it shipped  got a replacement one and truly only used it for smoothies with fresh fruit  not_even frozen fruit and after 3 months it just died suddenly  the motor won_t_even work anymore  broke down within 3 months  broke down within 3 months of buying the_product  waste of money  buy something else  gasket malfunction no response from amazon do_not_buy this blender  the gasket  on which the blades are attached  popped out after the second time_i washed it  i have been contacting customer support and have had no replies on how to resolve the issue or go about returning for a refund  in addition  the container is a_very thin plastic  it took very long for this blender to blend  even without my issue i_don_t think the blender is worth the_price i paid  so disappointed     i purchase this item off of amazon  i_used it for smoothies and soups  it started smoking after using it less_than 10 times  so disappointed and this company does_not have a return policy  wish i had known that before hand smoking motor i so excited to receive my blender and thought hamilton beach was a_good brand but i literally only used this blender 5 times before it started smoking and the motor went out  very dissatisfied and disappointed cheap and not recommended feels cheap and the bottom part that s under the blender where you connect it to the blender for it to spin fell off  five_stars junk really junk  used four times and each time stunk like electric wires burning even with no load   to late to_return  wish i_used this item in the return timeframe   don_t waste your money   about the_only_thing_it is good_for is just blending protein powder and water or     this_product is worth about  10 00  it doesnt blend frozen fruit  your fruit comes out still in frozen hunks  it is loud  about the_only_thing_it is good_for is just blending protein powder and water or milk  forget spinach  because_it is still large soggy peices that come out  this costed  40 and its a pos  it s been exactly 6 months   my blender base is     it s been exactly 6 months   my blender base is smoked out  i_don_t use it everyday   i was simply blending my black beans   mushrooms before it started to smoke  literally smoke was coming from the control buttons as_well as underneath  i_ve tried_to find replacements  nothing    i_m thinking of simply calling the manufacture  hopefully this didn_t happen to all_of them  stop  do_not_buy this_product  i never do reviews but i have to warn you guys  this is the worst buy i have ever made in my life  never buy this_product  it damaged just six months after i_purchased it  spend your money on something better  not recommended lasted less_than 2 weeks  it had a_bit of a burning smell when doing shakes but when i_tried cheese  as per the instructions  it completely smoked  not recommended  you get what you pay_for the_way its built the cup sometimes doesn_t sit right so when you turn it on it jumps up off the base  what happened to me is that it jumped up one to manu times and knocked out all the rubber teeth that connects the blade to the base  save yourself the heartache because when it worked it was wonderful  on a positive note amazon returns could not be easier  one_star this can_t mix a think  instead_of sending it back i throw it out  
common sense   maintenance  it may be clich  but it seems common sense is uncommon  prior to purchasing my first nuti ninja as a family christmas gift last year i poured over the reviews of various products here on_amazon and there seemed to be a common theme among the negative reviews  sanitation and leaks  after using my blender for the better part of 10 months i_ve come to a conclusion   1 don_t overfill  2 clean the seal  i_m sure all_of us at some point have been guilty of over filling a conventional blender and the result is material fit for a comedy  if you disintegrate a solid object into a billion pieces it s going_to_take up more space  the blender will become a pressure vessel   hydraulic forces will find a way out  don_t over fill this or any blender for that matter  i suppose too if the base is cross threaded it won_t form a proper seal  if you look at the reviews of all brands of blenders there is a common thread to all the negative comments  are all blenders poorly designed  not likely  it more plausible to me that a certain percentage of folks either ignore the directions or are in such a hurry they over fill the container  of course there is the possibility a individual product is defective but that s going_to happen regardless of brand  the second big issue seemed to be cleanliness   sanitation  in my opinion not only is the seal removable on the ninja but it is absolutely imperative that you do so  no amount of soap and water is going_to clean around the seal  once you see how it is constructed i_m sure you ll agree  i_guess they re fragile if you go digging it out with a buck knife but don_t do that   use the correct tool  again this issue is_not unique to the ninja but common with many blenders  the seal on the ninja is_not an o ring or flat gasket style   it s a 8mm wide silicone 1mm thick pcompression seal and with a_little care can be removed allowing for proper cleaning of the seal and its seat  and replacement seals are available if_it does get damaged over time  i located scores of sellers online  once a_week at a minimum i_use a dental style pick tool to carefully lift the seal out for a thorough cleaning  once you pull that seal out and observe how it s made it all makes sense  so  don_t put too much stuff in it and take 5 minutes a_week to clean the seal and you ll be golden  now on to the good stuff  for a personal blender in a pregnant category where many sell for  200 00 to  400 00 this comes in at the low end of the_price range but appears to have good quality control using the_same materials as higher priced designs  the walls of the blending cups are thick as are the stainless blades  another feature i noticed was the where the motor drive mates with the blade cap  the latter is made of a softer material that absorbs shock rather than transmitting it thru the_drive assembly reducing the chance of fractures  no it s_not quiet by any stretch of the imagination but the vast majority of the noise seems_to be produced by the blending process_not the motor itself  i read a review by one poor soul who s unit belched sparks out the motor ventilation ports  needless to_say an isolated issue  in summary  i_ve used my ninja for 10 months on average 6 days pre week  i_ve put every combination of foods in from ginger root to grapes   yogurt to yucca   cucumber to cranberries  peanuts to passion fruit and with the proper ratio of solid to liquid filled to the correct level i_can honestly say i_ve never had a_problem   i_ve concocted some nasty tasting mixtures i_ll never do again but the ninja still looks   performs like_new  i_m a_very skeptical customer and was_in a quandary about which blender to_buy  every brand was on the table  oster bruan vitamix jamba juice blendtec nutribullet and believe me i have no problem returning a sub par product but this little guy has given me no reason to_say anything but good things  there s literally millions of these out there being used by every variety of person and the odds are some will have a bad experience  is the vast majority that love these   haven_t had an issue wrong  or is it more likely the few that for whatever reason had a bad experience are upset and vocal  common sense tells you the answer  even rolex has_its critics  one last thing  the 32oz cup is a handy addition to consider  i_can easily make drinks for three in one shot   be done with it  i_received nothing_in return for my review  i am in no way associated with this_product  i am a 56 year_old retired truck driver  i highly_recommend this_product  user friendly this was worth every penny  and i feel like i_got so_much more for my money  having also owned other  significantly higher priced juicers and mixers  this_one_is more compact  looks good on the counter  is way easier to_use and clean  and makes quick work of any ingredients you put in it  i_love you just screw off the blade lid  rinse it  and then screw on the regular cap  and go  this is no sissy blade  either  go ahead  put whatever you want in it  and watch it grind it up with ease  i add nuts  seeds  frozen fruits and veggies  protein powder  and literally  within seconds  i have a fantastic drink to_go  love the large and medium containers  so_i_can make enough for two days  if_i want  love this_machine  and i could have bought 12  yes 12  of them for what i paid for my other mixer  which now sits in the bottom counter  taking up space  because_it s too large and bulky  and really hard to clean  the almost perfect blender the nutri ninja pro provides 900 watts of power to breaks down fruits and vegetables for nutrient rich juices on the go  ninja pro extractor blades crush through ice  seeds  skins and stems for a smooth  even consistency  twist on the sip and seal lids and take your drinks with you  all parts are bpa free and dishwasher safe  the set comes_with  1  regular 24 oz  and  1  small 18 oz  nutri ninja cup with a sip and seal lid  our rating scale design  5 5 utility  5 5 effectiveness  5 5 noticeable flaws  this_product is loud  we mean vacuum noise loud  we recommend using this_product during non sleeping hours to avoid irritating your roommate  neighbor  or anyone within 200 feet from you  our answers to the frequently asked questions  can you use frozen berries  absolutely  we blend frozen berries and ice all the_time_and it works_great  are the jars made of glass  the jars themselves are made of plastic and not glass  but they re quite durable for plastic  is it hard to clean    especially the blade  thanks  the blades are not too hard to clean if you clean them immediately after use or within a short time frame  they can be a pain to clean when you put them on the kitchen sink for an extended time  it also depends on what you blend as_well  overall  a_great_and sturdy blender to mix your favorite drinks  we highly_recommend  but watch out for the loud and obnoxious sound that it makes  like our review  hit the  yes  button below for it being useful  leave us a comment if you have any questions or send us an email  thanks for reading  well_worth the_money for a quality blender i_ve had this for a_couple months now_and absolutely love it  while it can be used as a blender for other things such as sauces  i_use it exclusively for smoothies  anything_i put into it   ice  frozen fruit  etc  take mere seconds to fully blend into a smoothie with no lumps or missed fruit chunks  i also love how it comes_with two size cups   a 24oz cup i_use when having a smoothie as a meal  and an 18oz cup i_use if not that hungry  or making more of a dessert smoothie  the model i_purchased  bl456  also comes_with a  nutri ninja guide to nutritional goodness  that contains 75 recipes for various things such as smoothies  sauces  infused teas  soups  and juices  the book has a retail value of  19 99  personally  i wasn_t terribly interested in it as_i only use it for smoothies and many of the smoothie recipes called for ingredients i would never buy  but others may find it more useful  whoever also made the book also must really love almond milk because_it seemed like all_of the smoothie recipes called for it  and i hate almond milk  pros    heavy duty   takes mere seconds to fully blend anything_i put in it   two cup sizes   easy_to clean cons    didn_t find the recipe book that came_with it useful  though it may be useful for those who want it for more_than just smoothies  and like almond milk    it s loud overall  well_worth the_money for a quality blender  nutri ninja pro this is actually my third nutri ninja pro    two different homes and my husband travels with one  he is diabetic and sometimes uses a protein drink as a meal or snack   it is_not really  compact  exactly  but it travels easily enough  to be honest i also own a vitamix too  but this is the_one_i_use almost daily  it crushes ice cubes in a_few seconds to a smooth  creamy consistency  i_mix frozen fruit or fresh fruit and it easily blends those  if you re looking to_make smoothies and want it to be easy_to clean_and really efficient  this is the_one  i never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  love this  quick and easy  love this  i have used the magic bullet in past but motor and blades can_t blend ice and cups are too small  the was using an immersion blender which makes a mess and sometimes powder is left on sides  this nutrininja professional is amazing  got on prime day  it s super quick and blends easily  i_use it daily to blend frozen fruits  ice and vegan protein powder for protein shakes  no powder left on sides  no gritty feeling  super creamy    love the large cup  use it exclusively for my shakes  after blending  just put on lid and throw in my stainless steel straw and go  even recently bought my own beans and made my own coffee grounds  love how easy it is to_take off the blade and how substantial the cups and lids are  want_to_buy a_few more extra large cups  i_love to_take my shakes to_go  would be nice to have more_than one to_make hubby a large shake  best juicer blender bought this to_replace a nutri bullet   very weak motor  constant leaking  hard to open  this nutri ninja pro silver is super sturdy  lines up perfectly to the little notches in the base  so you know_it s secure  and power      fantastic takes less time to blend and pulverize my fruit  fresh spinach  ground flaxseed  a dollop of yogurt  a tablespoon of honey and protein powder  this baby rocks      no regrets on this_purchase     update  after three months of daily use  i_must say this is by far the most superior design for a blender  look no further  this_one does what it says  no leaks  no mess  and perfect every time  five_stars    i_m eating healthier  i_love this ninja  reasonably priced  i_m a picky eater  like a two year_old  i hate most fruits and veggies  seriously  i_like apple  orange  banana  grapes  lettuce  carrots  potatoes  tomatoes and that s about it  i_mostly ate junk food and processed foods  and i_m going on 45 and was over weight and tired all the_time_and i knew i had to eat better  so_i_bought the ninja  i buy frozen fruits and veggies  add vanilla yogurt and cranberry juice  ice and yummy i_m eating healthy and i_love it  i_don_t know why the smoothies taste good_but cooked beggies are yucky to me  i_ve lost weight and i_m feeling great  i recommend trying  update  i_bought this july 2016  its now jan 2018  i_use my ninja every morning to_make a smoothie for breakfast_and drink on my way to_work  i_use twice on saturday and sunday for breakfast_and lunch and it still works_like i_bought it yesterday  due to making fruit and vegetables smoothies everyday i_ve been eating healthier and lost 25 lbs since_i_bought   i have not exercised  just diet changes  i_love my ninja  the_seller too as_it came_in two days as_i_m a prime member and the packaging was great  no damage  but it is really super easy_to_use and practical for quick breakfast shakes very much still learning about this_product  but it is really super easy_to_use and practical for quick breakfast shakes  last night my hunny made salad with romaine  arugula  radish  scallion  evoo and a touch of sesame oil  half he put on a plate the_other half went into the mixing cup a small amount of good chicken broth was added because of the need for liquid  and pulsed a_few times  we both drank the end product  it was_good_and would be good_for anyone who has trouble chewing or swallowing  like after dental procedures  etc  we will keep experimenting  you are most limited only by your imagination or lack of it  lovely kitchen tool i_love a simple frozen banana and almond milk smoothie in the mornings  this blender is great_for frozen bananas  you could definitely make banana_nice cream  super easy_to_use and the cleanup is so nice  the_only reason i_need a blender now_is for hot things  everything else goes in the bullet  i_liked the_first one so_much i_bought a second     i_liked the_first one so_much i_bought a second for the office  i am on a meal replacement plan that requires making a shake four times a day  this_one_is perfect  crushes ice and frozen fruit perfectly  works_well every time  my only complaint is the lids are hard to_get on  you have to be sure they are lined up perfectly before putting in on the base to blend  the will screw in slightly crooked and then will leak  often i have to put it on and off a_few times to_get it lined up just right  but a minor issue  still highly_recommend  a mighty blender in a mini package i_don_t understand the complaint that it is  manual   it is so powerful that your pressure on the vessel is only for seconds to_get a perfect smoothie or blended soup  i also own the larger ninja professional bl660 blender in another location and can attest to the fact that while this nutri ninja pro is less powerful  for it s compact size and single blade design it is still a winner  while you don_t have the variability of the larger ninja s multi speed controls  imho a_lot of that stuff is really overkill anyway  highly_recommended for smaller venues or for single folks where the larger ninja is_not appropriate  one_of my favorite products of all time myself and my roommate used this blender every single day multiple times until we lost the base  i_know  how does a person even do that   so_i_purchased this_one and it s perfect  if multiple people use it  you might want_to_get a_few more of the cups but i have 0 complaints  also the_price on here is much cheaper than_in stores  great smoothie maker so_far this is great  i_m using it daily  it s easy_to_use and super easy_to clean  it blends easily and makes great smoothies  don_t see any reason to_buy a more expensive model  bought this and some spare cups as a birthday present for my daughter  it s been   6 weeks and she is using it a ton  she gets recipes off the_internet  make it up the night before and puts the cup in the fridge  in the am  she just blends and brings the cup with her to drink on the_way to her summer job  we bought this because_it was a much better price point than others we looked at   so_far we don_t see any reason to have paid more  we asked her if there is anything she wished were different or better about it and she thought for a second and then said   nope  this does exactly what i_wanted   amaxing small heavy duty machine this blender is amazing  i_did my research before purchasing this_machine  i have not had a_problem with leakage  tends to happen if you fill it past the max fill line   always blends ingredients very_well_and the cups are sturdy  the blades are really sharp so please be very careful when cleaning them  i have had a_few minor cuts due to this lol  the_machine is slightly noisy however it does_not affect my usage of the_machine  great machine_for an amazing price  since_i tend to utilize 3 5 days per week i have to bleach the tops  even after washing them thoroughly with dish soap and hot water  due to them smelling sour  i think i will purchase more cups and lids lol  soooo quiet compared to magic bullet  i live in a place where others are asleep when i leave and arrive at odd hours  so the magic bullet was a nightmare  this is about a quarter the volume of noise    other_than that i_d say it s better built  and so are the cups  the lids are heavy duty and hold tight  there s an overall sense of weight that tells me that basically the magic bullet is a volkswagon bug    awesome for college but needs to be replaced part by part  and this is a tundra   haul your stuff and don_t worry about the sand and puddles   great_for making healthy smoothies works infinitely better_than a blender and is uber fast in pulverizing fruits and vegetables  easy_to clean in the dishwasher but make sure you handle the blades carefully   they are very sharp  love it  works as_advertised so_far  so_good  very effective  thorough  and quick in making smoothies  i_use mine every day in my cancer fighting regimen and i_m beating that little devil with the help of this ninja  came quite well_packaged but minus the two sippy cups the_box said were within  love it except for the recipe book after one week of use  we love this nutri ninja pro  the_one we bought came_with a larger and smaller cup  the grinding action is fabulous and frozen fruits are no obstacle for it  the recipes in the included book are pretty yuck but we ve been making up our own recipes  for example pina colada  frozen pineapple  organic coconut milk  lime juice  and bananas  delish  truly amazing  i was really not expecting so_much power from this  it is truly amazing    if you don_t have this in your life then get it  it blends smoothly  you can feel the_power when it s on and your hands are on it  the cups are very big and awesome as_well  you can blend a_lot  easy_to clean  it s a_little loud so just keep that in mind if you want_to blend at 10 00pm   i absolutely love this   amazing little machine even better_than what i imagined after reading tons of reviews  it is very  very sturdy and built of heavy duty materials  including the blades and the cups  i_did read all the directions  which i recommend  and have not had a_bit of trouble  it comes_with a_great recipe book and complete directions  it_even shows you how to stack the cup for best performance  i have made some great smoothies  just read all the directions and take good care of your blender        you will be well rewarded  i_love this darn machine i_love this darn machine  i_used to have a  20 blender  then i_got this  no looking back  i_make daily smoothies  use it for hummus  and basically anything a food processor would do  grinds down ice  frozen fruit  garbonzo beans  you name it  crazy fast  my only gripe is that the cups are wide and don_t fit in standard cupholders  feels like a silly design oversight  great_product  used daily  pulse it like the instructions say  purchased this_as a gift for the guy who rents a room from me  he uses it every night  i_ve used it once or twice  i believe the instructions say to pulse blitz it  i believe that s why i had heard complaints of similar products overheating  this model has a thermal fuse  so_if_it does overheat  it should protect the_product and force the user to allow it to cool before continuing  that s never happened to him or i though  great_for smoothies  while nowhere near as amazing as those vitamixes are  this_thing_is a beast when it comes to smoothies  the_only drawback is that it s incredibly loud  so you may wake people up if you re making a smoothie at 5 30 am  it blends up berry seeds really well  i gag when seeds hit my tongue while drinking a smoothie  i have texture issues    not a_problem with this little beast   love it   glad i_purchased   huge upgrade from the magic bullet thingie  excited to_use this for smoothies and so  so_much more  exactly what i_wanted  when i_made the decision to purchase this  i asked myself what i would honestly be using it for  i looked back over my past few years when i lived with roommates and decided that i really only used this item for smoothies and mixed drinks  with that  i knew that i_didn_t need the full kitchen set but i am excited to_see i_can do so_much more_than just smoothies with this_one  the recipe book was a_great surprise as_i_didn_t see that when i_purchased it and i am looking_forward to pairing this with my ninja coffee bar system to help me lose weight and feel great as_i start the next chapter of my life  quick and convenient love it  so_much better_than having a regular blender  i stopped making morning smoothies because_it was such a pain to clean the blender cup_and blades every time but with this it is really easy_and fast  it blends really well too  highly_recommend got this to_replace the giant size ninja blender  which is really terribly awful at making smoothies  this ninja pro  however  is awesome for making smoothies and i officially love it  quick and easy_to_use  the scale of this is actually funny       the motor and housing are huge and the cup itself is small     but i_guess it takes a_lot of real estate to keep a motor that powerful inside     love this and highly_recommend it  smoothies every morning  i am really enjoying the ninja  even my husband is on board  we have experimented with lots of fruit veggie combos  i have a smoothie every morning  the ninja is powerful and truly  smooths  everything from spinach to ice  i_ve never had a lump of anything_in my smoothie  the fill line is and absolute  don_t go over the line and you will not have any problems_with leakage  love it  it was definitely a_great choice  love it  i_bought this back on 10 30 2016 and i still love it  i just used it this morning to_make a shake  it s powerful and blends really well  it s a_little loud  but  most  if not all blenders are  i_definitely recommend this_product  5_stars couldn_t be better the ninja blender is one_of the_best blenders on the market right now from making smoothies to frozen margaritas_it is a_great machine  it comes_with a_very detailed recipe book that will have you trying_to new drinks for months  the_power in such a small machine that takes up little space is what sets it apart from the rest of the field  great way to boost calorie on kids that are picky eaters got this primarily for my kids  sometimes they don_t want_to eat so making smoothies of fruits  yogurt and nuts is healthy  taste good_and keeps their calorie intake up  powdered peanut butter and dried egg whites are good ways to_get the needed protein in their diets too  frozen fruit works_great because you don_t have to worry about it going bad and also makes the smoothie nice_and cold  great_product so_far and have been using it for a_couple months on a daily basis  yes yes yes why did i not get this sooner i honestly do_not know why i_did_not get this sooner  last year i_got on a morning smoothie kick and have a normal ninja which i_love  but it was such a hassle cleaning out every morning for just one smoothie  this is fab  i_make my smoothie and then rinse off the blade and pop the travel lid on and i am out the door to_work love love love  purchase this and you will not regret it   i blend fresh and frozen fruits and spinach and it pures beautifully  this_thing_is a beast  my boss bought one_of these for the office  because she and her husband drink a_lot of protein shakes  as do i   for over a year  it has been used on an almost daily basis  some days as many as 4 or 5 times  and has held up like a champ  a_couple_of us like to_make our shakes thick  and use a_lot of ice   lately i_ve noticed it takes a_little longer to blend everything  but i think it s to be expected that the blades might be getting dull after a year of grinding ice  on here now shopping for that   looks_like i_can replace the entire blade assembly for less_than  20  happy customer  love it  i_love this blender  i never used my old blender  but now with this_one_i_make smoothies for breakfast several times a_week  it is fast_and only takes a minute to blend everything  i have also put crushed ice in it and made shaved ice  i_don_t use the to_go cup lids  i pour my smoothie into a disposable cups to drink on the_drive to_work  once_i blend my smoothie i just rinse the cup_and blades with water and leave them out to dry to_use tomorrow  my go to smoothie is half of a ripe frozen banana  half a cup of frozen blueberries  half a cup of vanilla soy milk  or any milk type  and half a cup of water  fast  quiet  blends everything_i_ve thrown at it  blends everything  fast  quieter than my normal size blender  and the travel cups are awesome for quick morning smoothie blend and go  the recipe book has some nice tasting options too  always nice to try a different mix  update  one month in and this continues to impress  i will have to look into their bigger versions so the missus and i_can both use it in the morning  i_ve blended carrots  spinach  and other leafy greens without issue using very little water or juice in my smoothies  love it  strong blender  works as_advertised  i_like it s simple function and quick blend ability  i_use it to_make smoothies and pulverize cooked   steamed vegetables to create a sauce to  disappear  in food so my toddler doesn_t refuse to eat because she sees an icky bit of carrot or other vegetable  the size of the blender and blending cups is prefect for my family of two adults and a toddler  ninja works  this blender was my final decision after reading countless reviews  i_ve made a smoothie at least twice a day since receiving this blender and i have nothing but great things to_say  the ninja is so easy_to assemble and use  within five minutes i was ready_to_make my first smoothie  the blender hardly takes up any space on my counter and cleaning after use is so simple  i_love the cups that came_with the ninja  which makes my mornings hassle free  the_price is great_and you cannot go wrong  works_great  i_love my nutri ninja pro  it works so fast_and makes an incredible smooth shake in seconds  i_use it every morning  it s super easy_to clean  i never use my blender any more  my go to shake is ice  almond milk  protein powder  a banana  and peanut butter  it takes me under 2 minutes to whip up_and i have my morning shake to_get my day started when i_m in a hurry  i have also made my kids some delicious fruit smoothies in it and they love it too  works_well  really loud  after about a_month of almost daily use   we re pleased_with how this performs  blends pretty much anything quickly_and smoothly  it cleans up in the dishwasher pretty well  as long as you don_t let smoothie junk dry in it first  it is louder than our last two blenders   noticeably  if noise is a concern  i e  living in an apartment with paper thin walls   think twice about this blender  otherwise  if performance is your goal   this is a winner  we purchased this because_it was one_of the_best personal blenders according to america s test kitchen testing  and we ve been pleased_with the_purchase  pros  it works_well  blends pretty much anything and_everything quickly_and smoothly cons  its really loud if_i could change anything about this_product  make it quieter packaging type  retail packaging   full color printed box  just what you d get from any brick and mortar store if you found this review helpful   please click the  yes  button below this review indicating so   thanks  maybe my best purchase ever on_amazon absolutely love this_product  so easy_to clean  takes 30 seconds from using it to leaving it clean to dry  it has literally changed my diet and lifestyle  have lost 10  of my body weight in 3 weeks using it for at least one meal a day  works for everything  i even use it to scramble eggs  fun to_use with the kids and i save money not using the_drive thru anymore  its fun using fresh ingredients to_make up random concoctions  chops extremely efficient and fast  i have bought two  one_its quite a_bit more quiet than the_other  great_product    ninja blender works better_than all_of the_other ones on the market   ive bought 3 different name brands and this_one_is by far the most solid  the blending cups are thicker and sturdier    the blending blades are also sturdier    i_used to have to blend for 30 45 seconds  which was_not at_all a_problem but would not make shake worthiness   this_one_is 10 seconds and i_can blend almonds into my shake  i truly enjoy this little machine    follow instructions and go    i_cant find a thing wrong with it  as stated in my headline i_can_t find a thing wrong with it  the designers knew what they were after when designing this_product  it does a_great job with everything that it says it will do and it does it very efficiently  cleanup is super simple  in less_than a minute  before i workout  i fill half full with frozen strawberries  a small banana  a 2 scoops of protein and fill to the line with water  process with 6 8  2 second pulses and my post workout drink is ready  drinking this while driving  as apposed to eating individual items  while driving is much less distracting and no accidental messes  love  i_love this_thing  small but mighty  i have been looking at this model for a while now but on black friday i pulled the trigger  i initially purchased this for my toddler who is the world s pickiest eater  the thought was_i would be able_to sneak some nutrition into him via smoothies  and although he seems_to like them i_love them even more  they sell frozen organic fruits and veggies at walmart so assembling the stuff to_make smoothies is easier than ever  it s simple to_use and i toss the parts in the dishwasher when i_m done  i_d say go for it  even if you use it once and a while the_price can_t be beat and it s uses are many  blends like a pro love it  i_make daily protein shakes with milk  protein powder  fruit  peanut butter  and ice  this blends it all quickly_and thoroughly  why did i wait so long to_get this  great blender  very convenient that the cups you blend     my protein spinach smoothies are as smooth as can be now  no more gross chunks  great blender  very convenient that the cups you blend in are the_ones you drink out_of and that there is a smaller and larger size  perfect_for my husband and i  blends everything to a smooth consistency this is an upgrade from my magic bullet  which i also love but which often left chunks of unprocessed fruits  this_one makes my drink completely smooth  just be sure you have the lid screwed on tightly when you use  cuts like a ninja  but not silent like one in the few weeks i have owned the ninja  i have been drinking more smoothies than_i have in years  it is compact and easy_to clean  it is loud  so make you smoothies in the evening to avoid waking up the family or neighbors  as long as you do_not fill the cups above the marked fill line the ninja does a_great job in tearing up whatever food stuff i put in it  if_it maintains it s performance in the long term then i will consider this_one_of the most useful purchases i have made  good smoothie maker i_like the_way it whips up smoothies very easily  love it s ease  i had leaking on the blade lid on the side that goes into the blender  i_m not_sure why this is happening unless a washer or something has gone bad  i called ninja at 877 646 5288 and they are sending me a_new blade  great company standing behind their products  thank you well_worth the_money    unbeatable for the_price  gone through several  quality  blenders and this is the_best  very_well constructed  i_use it for blending the morning smoothie and  although it sounds a_bit like a cement mixer  it really does the job  looking_for a quality blender at a reasonable price   this is it  great_product bought this_as a gift for my son along with additional cups and lids  he uses it every day and loves it  i also ordered another as a gift for my elderly father who needed a nutrition boost after losing his appetite due to having major surgery  he basically drank smoothies rather than solid food  it was a_great help      a review to_make sure i could get a_good use out_of it before writing a review i want_to_say that i waited a_few months of using the blender before writing a review to_make sure i could get a_good use out_of it before writing a review  my wife and i_love the blender  we went with this_one because of the stronger motor in it and i am glad we did  it has no trouble blending anything we put in it  just make sure to put enough liquids in there to actually blend  we will probably have to_buy more cups for it since we both like the big one_it comes_with  only downside is to clean it you have to remove the rubber ring that sits around the base of the blade and its hard to_get to  when you finally lift it up its pretty gross whats inside so_i recommend cleaning often if you use if a_lot  otherwise great_product  we bought it for black friday and got a_good_deal on it  excellent  though not quite perfect lots of power  easy_to_use  i_like that there s no power settings   just add ingredients and blend  easy_to clean  cons  sometimes you have to_work awhile to ensure the blades are screwed on square  as they want_to be cocked a_little  which leaks  if you don_t pay attention   and  i would have preferred the_same size cups  rather than two different sizes  happy_with my purchase  perfect_for frozen fruit after looking at several blenders i_decided to_go with this_one and i am happy i_did  i have other ninja products and this_one works just as_well as the_other products i have had for years  we use this daily for smoothies with frozen fruits and we have never had difficulty using it  it is easy_to_use and clean  there is_nothing else i could ask for in this_product and i hope it lasts as long as my regular blender  great  easy_to_use i_love this device  so_far ive used it for smoothies  great texture   making real whipped cream  and making organic salad dressing  easy_to_use and easier to clean than my blender  i_love that it has two sizes of containers and two sturdy  useful lids  this blender is perfect_for morning smoothies this blender is perfect_for morning smoothies  i_love that it comes_with two different size cups  one for me and one for my husband  and i_love that is makes for easy cleaning  compared to a large blender that you d have to_take apart and wash right after using   it definitely still makes some noise for being a single blender but it s_not so noisy that it s bothersome  haven_t had an issue with it not crushing ice or blending fruits veggies  would recommend  works_great_for frozen fruit and fresh veggies didn_t expect to like this_as much as_i_do  whoever first invented a type of blender where you don  t have to wash out a cup_and blender is a genius  nothing easier to_use than this and works_fine with ice  frozen fruit  carrots  beets  anything_i_ve thrown in it so_far  glad i_bought it  this blender is awesome  i am in love this blender is awesome  i am in love  i actually borrowed my friend s bullet  competitor to the ninja  recently and was floored by how crappy it was compared to my ninja and amazon has a_very competitive price compared to retail this_thing rocks so_far  so_good   this_thing_is awesome  i_ve been throwing in a cup of yogurt  frozen fruit and some milk and voila    instant fruit shake that s deeeeelish  super quick and easy cleanup too    next i_gotta try some ideas_in the recipe book that came_with it  mom loves shakes bought this for my mom and she made smoothies for everyone lol  she loves it  i_bought 5 months ago and although she doesn_t use it as much as the_first few weeks but she uses it often to_make healthy shakes  i_love this_thing i_love this_thing  it gets the job done  compactly and very quickly  my only complaint is that the motor is loud  and because you have to stand next to it to push it down for it to_work  you can_t leave the room while it is blending  to save your hearing    my solution is to push it down with one hand  stretching my arm and standing as far away as possible  while plugging the ear closest to the blender with my other hand  this may sound extreme  but i have very sensitive ears  so_i put this here for others who may share that issue  that said  i_m still very_happy_with this brilliant little blender  truly is the_best  wow  the ninja is really powerful  we compared how the texture of my spouse s shake she did with the nutri bullett 900 and she was amazed on how it tasted  it was more smoother  less thick  flavor was more powerful as_it was properly mix  the clean up of the blade is very simple and it has the lid that helps her while she drives  this is a missing item with nutri bullett  she is even tempted to_buy the main blender for her normal cooking  it s the_best i have ever bought  
after blended a drink bottom of the blender leaves black marks or dirts on ur table  hi there i just got this item from you and its working fine  but there is small issue every time when i blended some drinks underneath of blender came out black color dirts and hard to clean it i_dont know what that was but looks_like came out from blender cooling hole could you explain to me what it was   i had to put a fabric under  i would give this_product 4 stars  but it     i would give this_product 4 stars  but it is hard to remove the gasket from the blade base so you can clean it  using a butter knife  i get as far down the side of the gasket as_i_can  then i lift the gasket up until i_can grab it  that is the_only flaw to the nutri ninja  out with the bullet  in with the ninja i_bought this when my beloved nutribullet refused to release the cup  i had the bullet for about 8 months and i_loved it despite the glitches   like occasionally having to_go to war just to_get the thing open  or realizing your smoothie is all over your walls even though you didn_t over fill it  but the bullet is sturdy  a_bit heavy and it does a wonderful job blending veggies  ice  frozen fruit  seeds and powders into a lovely  smooth consistency  after nearly dislocating my shoulder after 3 days of trying_to_get the bullet to release my drink and the drink has turned into zombie barf  i gave up_and the entire thing_is in the trash  enter the ninja  first impression  it s much lighter than the bullet and looks chintzy  it does_not have the suction cups on the bottom which were a wonderful touch on the bullet and you have to hold the cup in place in the ninja for the duration of the processing  unlike the bullet  which allows you to walk away during the 30 seconds of processing  the ninja only has 1 processing option   the bullet has 2 the ninja s cups are smaller than the bullet  but fit in car cup holder better  obvious pros are the_price is less_than the bullet  there is no twisting the cup into place on the processing unit so there is no risk of an accidental crooked twist resulting in a locked cup_and a_lot of money in the garbage   not to mention no breakfast  the smoothie came out just as smooth ones from the bullet  i also like the cup lid better on the ninja as the rubber stopper on the bullet cups kept coming off  i_love my bullet when it worked and would have given it 5_stars if_i_d written a review 2 hours after opening the_box like i_m doing for my ninja  but after discovering all the glitches and having to toss it in the trash after less_than a year  i_d give the bullet no stars check out some of the youtube videos that come up with the search  i_can_t open my nutribullet    the struggle is real people  get the ninja  very quick but doesnt completely break down everything  i_bought this_as a gift for my wife  she likes to_make shakes to bring to_work in the morning  she said it is very quick and very strong but sometimes she notices it doesnt completly break everything down and it winds up leaving a_few whole bits  overall it works_well but i would leave it run for a_few more seconds than you think it needs just to be sure everythings broken down  i put in frozen fruits and it shreds them good  not related to the_product but this_thing_is powerful  and exretemely loud my floor shakes  it works thought  i_use to to_make smoothies  i put in frozen fruits and it shreds them good  not related to the_product but    originally i_bought this and there was some issue of it being delivered and it was suppose to be re delivered but then got lost somewhere     not_sure if usps stole this or lost it  i had to reorder a_new_one  so_it basically took a_week to receive this  when it was suppose to be 2 day prime  surprised i_thought i wouldn_t like it more_than my old nutribullet  but i was surprised that i_liked it better  i_like that you have to hold down the cup for the_unit to operate  since_i feel it is safer because you can control the blade action  also  you don_t have to worry about a locking mechanism  with the nutribullet the locking mechanism was always jamming  i_didn_t give it a 5 star rating because the_unit was_advertised as  like_new  and the base as_well as the cup came_with obvious scratches  overtighten to avoid leakage  this is the second time around reviewing this item  the_first review was_not approved  it figures  however  i gave nutri ninja another shot  and i realized the leaking problem in the lid that i was having while in use  was due to the fact that you have to overtighten the lid for it to_work appropriately  otherwise it always leaks  so with that being said  i_can deal with that  i_like the concept of these personal rocket type of blenders  but i feel the  nutri bullet   due to it s removable blade assembly that has two distinct kind of blades  offers a_little bit more versatility  and a finer grinding  so basically  i feel like it would be awesome of ninja gave also that other blade assembly to have better blend on harder things  little blender that packs quite a punch  i_ve only used this blender a_couple_of_times so_far but this little blender packs a punch  it is quite powerful to blend a smoothie right_up  i_love that you just fill your cup  twist the blade on  click it in place and push down  it is easy for on the go mornings  its great size fits great on the counter so_i_dont have to drag it out_of cupboards everytime_i want_to_use it  so_far very glad i_purchased this item  super smoothie blender  i absolutely love this_thing  it s so easy_to_use and clean  works so fast_and makes the perfect smoothie  incredible value for such a high quality appliance  highly_recommend  my only complaint is that there are no measurements printed on the cups  that would be a really nice feature but it s_not a huge deal  really does a fast job of blending  did a ton of reading reviews on this_thing before getting it  i really like the size of it and that it comes_with 2 different sized containers  it can whip up just about anything_in minutes  the cord can be stored underneath  cleanup is really easy by adding a_little soap to water and running the blender  only complaint is the noise  it is quite loud  otherwise nice quick and does the job  i_can even make hummus in this_thing  
decent blender  horribly over packaged the blender is decent  good stuff  easy cleanup  two mixing cup sizes with nice sealed lids  it grinds fruits and veggies into a_nice smooth drinkable blend  bad  the capacity of the larger mixing vessel is less_than_idea  at most you can make a single largeish smoothie  i_d prefer to be able_to_make two biggins at a time  it s excessively loud  so_much so that my noisy little coffee grinder shudders in fear when the ninja begins to scream  the packaging material used to protect and ship this item was over the top  see the picture  it was_in a corrugate box inside a double corrugate box inside still another corrugate box  plus three molded cardboard inserts and no less that seven assorted plastic bags and such  no wonder amazon ceo jeff bezos is obsessed with space exploration  at this rate amazon will deplete the planet s packaging resources in no time  let s try to_do better  meanwhile i_m going back to local shopping for things like this that distributed with reasonable consideration for our precious planet  cheers  serves the purpose but loud as heck  so this is the second time_i am buying this after the_first one stopped blending well_and became super loud after a_couple_of years  i owned the nitri blender professional but hated it because_it makes watery smoothies that aren t smooth at_all  really didn_t want_to purchase another nutrininja but after reading reviews about other extractors this_one seems like the_best bet for what i_need  it does blend smooth and quick  however it is loud as heck and vibrates like it s_not calibrated properly  i almost wonder if this is a defect and need_to be returned because_i_don_t think it should vibrate the_way it does  almost as_if_it isn_t stable  i will update after a_bit of usage  other_than my previous concerns this blender is ok  comes packaged well  the cups although i wish were larger are good quality  and the recipe booklet is informative about nutrition and smoothie recipes  a big disappointed  it does the work it s supposed to_do  by that i_mean it mixes everything up in a_very quick manner  my only and big problem with this is that it does t have a lock option so_it is really manual   i have to stand there with my hand on top to_get it going and keep it going   a similar product i_used had the capability to lock the container in and keep on mixing until i turned it off  you probably did this for safety s sake  but it s nt a_great idea for me  otherwise  it s fine  but that was a big big disappointment to me and had i_known i would have looked for exactly what i_wanted  in other words  i am not explaining this well   it doesn_t have a lock option  it works wonderfully  have yet to encounter an item it cannot     pros  when it works  it works wonderfully  have yet to encounter an item it cannot blend  makes fine work of both soft ingredients  fruit  vegetable leaves  etc   as_well as harder ingredients  carrots  almonds  etc   cons  can be difficult to secure the lid with a full bottle  can be difficult to clean  especially inside the_unit  not for those looking_for  quiet  blenders  final  as far as single serve smoothie makers go  this does the job just_fine  dont buy if you already have a blender  i still get fruit stuck on the blades and pieces of pulp or fiber  cranberries and pineaple is what i consume more  its just like a regular blender  nothing special i_does_not do what you see on the tv ad  no it wont  disolve  fruit nor seeds nor nuts    i still find it practical as a travel blender  i am a contractor so_im away from home all the_time  but definitely not what you see on tv  not that much better_than the less expensive bullet i replaced a failing bullet believing i was getting a far greater unit in both performance and durability  from the_first use this_unit leaks and didn_t perform significantly better_than the less expensive bullet  i will keep it but was_not as happy_with the results as_i was hoping for  additionally  as others have pointed out the base of this_unit is very hard to remove when hot liquids are being blended  my wife uses this for bullet coffee every day  she is very strong and still needs me to open this up for her occasionally  since_it is so hard to remove the fact that it still leaks is a mystery    loud  but does the trick  super loud  but does the trick  i_m embarrassed to_make shakes in the morning for fear that i_ll wake up my neighbors in my apartment building  i_m not exaggerating  it s loud   but i really enjoy the single serve aspect of this blender and how fast it blends my smoothies  read many reviews about not over filling to avoid leaking  and i haven_t had problems since_i_m conscious of not over filling  oh yeah  did i_mention it s super loud  you ve been warned  like  chainsaw in your kitchen loud i was excited to receive this because my magic bullet finally perished after a long and satisfying career  unfortunately i_m not as_impressed as_i_d hoped to be  to start  this blender is loud  like  chainsaw in your kitchen loud  but ok  i_thought i_d be so_impressed with it s blending ability i could look past that  not so     it doesn_t completely pulverize all_ingredients as promised  no matter how long you run the chainsaw    er blender   it leaves bits and pieces behind for a gritty smoothie  bummer  too much trouble i am trying_to like this ninja  i_used my daughter s last year and i_thought all_of the different ones of the_same brand would work as_well as the_one she had  mine are used several times every day  i have used up 5 magic bullets in the last 10 years  my 5th one has just about had it  so_i started looking at the nutri ninja blenders  these are my biggest complaints with the model i_purchased  there is only one blade  i think it is a crushing blade but i am not_sure what they called it  mine is having lots of problems crushing up frozen fruit  it is very loud and i have to keep adding liquid and taking it off  opening the lid and stirring yet  i always have pieces of fruit from the bottom that is_not blended  next  even though it came_with two cups  they are much larger than_i_can drink at a time  i saw where someone said that you must be careful  not to overfill it  the fill line is marked clearly on the cup  the cups are smooth and do_not have a handle to carry it with  that is a big problem for me  i have ms and i_do_not always have full use of my hands  i have dropped the cup full of liquid two times so_far  i have started using the ninja pro to_use as a juicer and then i have to pour it into one_of my magic bullet cups that have a handle  you get 2 lids  just alike  with a spout and a lid to keep it from spilling  i_don_t know about having it in the car because the cups are too big for my console cup holders  i am very_disappointed with this_purchase and i am considering sending it back and going back to my magic bullet which has two kinds of blades  4 handled cups as_well as a tall one and short one that doesn_t have handles  i also get a large pitcher for larger crowds  the nutri ninja has more power but is it worth the_price  i_love it but i_don_t think its that powerful for     i_love it but i_don_t think its that powerful for a ninja and the_price i go by the rules and directions and constantly have to open it and move things around and i_ve never had this problem with other machines  it still does the job though  and its extremely loud but you won_t find any that aren t  although i wish you could 
powerful but poor quality machine i purposely waited a_bit to write this review to_see if this item would hold up  and unfortunately it did_not  as for the_power and ability to_make a_great smoothie  it is fantastic  however  it is a cheap piece of plastic except for the motor and wears out very easily  the blade assembly that you insert into the motor must be situated exactly right  if not  it could easily strip the_unit  this is what happened to me  basically rendering the_unit useless  i called ninja since this is well within warranty but was told the warranty was for the motor only and a blade replacement was_not available  however  they would be willing to_replace the whole unit for the_cost of the blade assembly which was  39 99 plus  6 99 shipping and sales tax  so basically  i would be paying another  49 99 for a replacement unit that i already paid  69 99 for back in january  and probably would not last anyway  it makes no sense to me and i won_t do it  disappointing smoothie maker pro s  inexpensive small base takes up less space blend in the_same drinking container so you only wash 1 container con s  no speed selection  it s on or off and you need_to push down and hold the container to blend its useless if you like smoothies on the thicker side  the blade design doesn_t work well for thick ingredients it doesn_t  blend  very_well_and leaves clumps and chunks of unmixed ingredients  even if you extend blend time  the lid leaks if_it s_not sealed very tightly it s very noisy loud summary  i_liked the nutri bullett much better for making thicker smoothies and the vitamix is the_best  but pricey   but at first it worked fine  and now_i have to_play around with     i_can_t figure out how to contact seller  but at first it worked fine  and now_i have to_play around with it to_get it to_work  i press down and nothing happens  this has been going on for the past couple days and i have only had this for a_couple weeks  leaky lid i_bought a_new ninja because my old one_started leaking during the blending process after 3 or 4 years of use  unfortunately  my brand_new_one leaks into the_machine every time_i_use it  if_it weren t for this i would like the_product because_it blends well  i_m just not going_to be happy spending more money replacing the lid or the whole system yet again  i_purchased this item to_replace magic bullet of 600     i_purchased this item to_replace magic bullet of 600 watts  the_product feels and is durable and does what the description says  from previous experience with ninja products  it only operates with constant pressure  with this_product i sometimes have to apply pressure several times to turn it on and it will turn off on its own  i think it s a manufacturing  defect  also  it is very loud and had to_return it today and purchased a magic bullet 1000 watt  sharkninja i hope you can help me with the noise problem  nutri ninja pro  bl456  this is my third 900 watt ninja pro in four years   2 is beginning to burn out  smell for the last week  and because_i_use the ninja for a smoothie every morning   primarily berries  protein powder  half an apple cut in pieces  protein powder and other small odds and ends   i_got  3 so_i wouldn_t have to miss my smoothies while waiting for another blender after  2 finally goes  the_product works_well for me  so_i_m willing to stay with it in spite of the relatively short longevity with regular  but light use  i_tried  3 for the_first time this morning and the noise was so ear piercing that it was all i could do to keep using it the relatively short time necessary to blend my smoothie  perhaps i_didn_t perceiver long enough  because  though blended adequately  i_don_t think it was blended as_well as my previous ninjas  again  i_may not have kept at it long enough    but the noise   also  sadly  3 isn_t made as_well as previous ones  i will be returning this_one but don_t want_to have to give up on the_product  i hope sharkninja can offer me a quieter ninja pro 900 watt  i_do hope this_one_is an anomaly  terribly loud  no returns policy read the return policy  you cannot return it  and if you live alone and don_t have to be concerned about waking everyone_in the house  it s ok  but if you happen to want a smoothie late while you re up working or watching tv  or even during the day while your child is taking a nap  forget it  but i_don_t live alone  and while up late working i_made myself a smoothie and woke everyone_in the house with the terribly loud noise  when i pressed down on the top to start it  it scared the bejeezus out_of me  i_made the mistake of not reading the return policy  so_i_m stuck with the thing until spring when i_can stick it in a yard sale  i should ve shopped at walmart  where i could ve returned it only good_for one and half month it was great_for a_month  i was having a_good time for making smoothie drinks  but after a_month and half  it suddenly stop working anymore  
product went bad before one year product went bad before one year  bought protection plan  but both asurion  the_company that sells protection plan  and the manufacturer both refused to_replace since there is no serial number at the base of the motor and also we didn_t receive any protection plan info in the_box  couldn_t be more disappointed        now_i am really peeved  this is the 2nd nutri ninja i have purchased  the_first one lasted for a decent amount of_time before it began smoking and a horrible burning rubber smell filled my house  but i had used it a_lot so chalked it up as normal wear and tear  debated on buying another  but decided to_go ahead because_i_drink a smoothie for breakfast maybe 2 3 times a_week and the nutri ninja does a_good job of chopping ice  i_bought the 2nd one_in june  less_than 3 months ago  this morning it started smoking and that burning rubber smell happened again  so_into the garbage it goes  will not be a fool and buy this_product again  clearly the design is inferior  try a different brand  less_than 30 days of use and it s dead  after less_than two years of very sporadic use  it does_not_work any more  the blender was bought to be used at a location i visit ever 2 3 months for a_week  if you add up the total usage  it won_t reach 30days of use  is this blender meant to die after such low use  it s_not the most expensive blender  but it s_not cheap for such bad performance  it broke one month after the lousy warranty expired  oy vey  the ninja stopped working today and so after making sure it wasn_t the outlet or anything else i_decided to_get out the warranty information on it  it comes_with a 12 month warranty  the warranty says that if the ninja breaks during the warranty period you have to pay to ship it to their facility and also_include a check for  19 95 to  cover return shipping and handling   i was furious thinking about having to pay 2 3 of the_cost of a_new item only to_get a factory refurb as a replacement  well  it just so happens that the ninja i_bought is 13 months old so even that lousy warranty isn_t an option  will never buy ninja brand again  will damage your hearing the_only other blender i have owned that was this loud was a broken blendtec that had to be repaired  the_first one was so loud i assumed it was defective and had it replaced  the second is just as bad and leaves my ears ringing after use  i work around power tools alot and my table saw is quieter than this blender  maybe i_got 2 duds in a row but that is as much a reason to not recommend this_product as the noise issue  by the_way i have a blender collection as_i am a_bit of a smoothie fiend  i have plenty_of experience with blenders and really wanted this cheaper alternative to be my new goto  it s in perfect condition but the motor is dead very frustrating  i_bought this item in may 2017 and used it about 10 times and it no longer works at_all  it s in perfect condition but the motor is dead  blender throws electric sparks from the bottom received the item last week and it throws electric sparks from the bottom when in action  if you leave a white clothes underneath then it covers it with black residue  i have just tried it once and it seems_not safe at_all  thanks to amazon s great customer_service  i_got full refund  does_not do well with frozen fruit  my old ninja master prep was wearing out after 5 yrs or more of use  this blender will not make  smooth  smoothies with frozen fruit as_well as the prep  i returned and will order the original  very loud  shipped timely  but machine doesn_t work properly  when i put the blender and the container on the base to blend  it makes a horrible loud noise and the base vibrates a_lot  at present i am very_disappointed and not happy_with it  i have other ninja products and am very_satisfied_with them  i would return this  one_star pieces don_t fit the_machine  
great_value and decent blender for the_money great_value and decent blender for the_money  the glass pitcher is thick and heavy duty  the lid fits so tight and sturdy it takes a_little strength to remove until it  breaks in  and loosens a_bit  but that sure beats a floppy or loose lid that doesn_t stay put when blending  i have made several smoothies with frozen berries and ice and it works just_fine  like any blender  if your mixture is too thick and icy  some liquid needs added to_get it to thoroughly mix into that  whirlpool  effect from the bottom up  otherwise  you have to  pulse and spoon  the mixture down to release air pockets and get it to_settle to the bottom of the picture for mixing  this is typical with any blender i have used however  and i have owned blenders from  19 to  450  i expect to_get a_couple years worth of smoothie and margarita mixing out_of it and then buy another when the motor burns up or the gears slip  as already stated though  i am extremely pleased_with the_quality for the_price_and think it is a top value when it comes to blenders  clean_and easy this is a simple  straightforward blender  easy_to assemble  easy_to clean  the capacity is great enough_to_make a_couple_of smoothies no problem  and i seem to not make such a mess with this blender as_i have some others  simple design allows for simple maintenance  recommended    wow    this is an awesome blender and the fact that the blender jar is glass makes for super easy clean up   you won_t be disappointed for the_price  excellant blender this is an excellant blender that does what i want it to_do very_well  i_do_not make smothies or grind ice in this blender and cannot state how it would hold up doing these things  however  i am very_pleased_with my purchase and give it a high recommendation  five_stars this blender is amazing    makes great margaritas and smoothie s  great blender  black   decker always has quality merchandise  great blender  this blender has_it all    this blender has_it all    fits in a tight space  if your counter area lacks room  like mine   the buttons are thoughtfully engineered and arranged for easy use  the  glass jar  actually came_in plastic  which is great_for me  highly_recommended great_product and great_value  settings just as_good as a more costly alternative  and lid seals very tight for no leaking during operation  good_product great_product for the_price five_stars great item  doesnt take up a_lot of space and has been easy_to_use and clean glass container a gift for my mom  she loves it and says the glass container is easier to clean than plastic ones  it does the job and for the_price  i     it does the job and for the_price  i_can not expect more    it is worth to_buy  works_perfectly  i_got it for my dad to mix up his     i_got it for my dad to mix up his protein shakes and things of that nature  it may not be top of the line  but for  15 or how much it cost  it sure is handy for what he uses it for  it will blend  top seal is a flexible material and has a_nice multi ring  so when i am blending liquids they don_t squirt out the top edges  as happens on many of the lower end blenders  love this is a_good blender  the jar is heavy glass though  still good  solid craftsmanship  the glass is thick and i_dont     solid craftsmanship  the glass is thick and i_dont picture it breaking anytime soon  i_use it to blend smoothies and prepare baby food almost daily  and it has_not given me any trouble  five_stars great blender  i_use it to_make smoothies and i_love it  cheap but does the job  i_got this after my expensive blender literally ground itself up  this blender is inexpensive and work s well for making breakfaast smoothies with frozen fruit  it handles large frozen solid

it few times a day and very_satisfied_with the_quality of it  great_deal  i_can_t believe anything so cheap  not inexpensive   cheap  could be any good  but it blends  and blends and blends  a_little

easy use  cleaning and consistency this is such a_great_product  and super easy for people to_make their own smoothies and shakes  it s definitely worth the_cost  i_ve used mine about a hundred times already and each time_it makes some delicious shakes and smoothies  i recommend making sure to_add plenty milk  orange juice  coconut water or whatever other liquids you like in your drinks so that it ll be easier to blend all_of your mixtures together  it has so many different speeds to choose from depending on the consistency that everyone likes  also  make sure you clean your blender right after use as_it will be much easier than waiting because you ll have to try to scrub the bottom of the blender and get under the blades  it s super easy_to_use and always makes my liquids a_nice consistency  not the greatest  but it s good_for the_price  the blade handles most things fairly well for my shakes  like frozen fruit  but isn_t the strongest  there was a small rock in the blueberries i_bought  and the blade got very dinged up after only a_few seconds  it doesn_t pulverize ice well  left large chunks  even when i blended it for a_few minutes  cleans easily and it s nice that it s dishwasher safe  which is exactly what i_thought a_very inexpensive blender would be like  i am satisfied for the_money its cheap but it works  which is exactly what i_thought a_very inexpensive blender would be like  i am satisfied for the_money  it looks just like the picture  it blended great but it leaked from the glass onto the black     just used the blender for the_first time  it blended great but it leaked from the glass onto the black part during blending  and then leaked as_i was pouring smoothie into my cup  annoying mess     on par for price  a_good blender for the_price  it is very loud and does_not give very consistent blending consistency of ice into a smoothly  loud worked for my use  made sounds like gears and rocks  need ear protection  works_well  ive tried it with everything_including frozen fruits and ice  10 10 for cheap and well functioning blender   bought it on sale  good name brand good name brand  when the package arrived  it was hard to tell what went where  we looked at the book but since we did_not have all the pieces for it meaning not that there left behind more like what went where   what is it s purpose  we used it   got splatered  better explanation of speeds would be helpful  it works really well   we know now to_use low speeds in the beginning  great packing   can count on the brand  four_stars pretty content so_far  good_value takes some time to fully blend  need_to shake it around a_bit in between blends  overall great_for the_price  works but it sounds like its going_to die in less_than a year works but its been like 2 months and the motor is already starting to_get loud as_if_its housing is loose  this should be 3 stars but i have a 2nd blender of the_same brand and model that is like 4 years old  and works_perfectly four_stars great cheap blender for the rv does the job okay enough it does the job okay enough  you cant complain for the_price  great_for the occasional smoothie great blender for the_money great blender for the_money  sturdy well made i already made pesto in this a_few times and it came out great  round and round we go      performed as_described  good_product four_stars great_value for the_price  love that it s glass  does an ok job with dates the feature i_like the_best about this inexpensive blender is that it     the feature i_like the_best about this inexpensive blender is that it has a glass jar  which lasts much longer and sustains more cleaning in it s life than plastic does  
the plastic bottom is super cheap  and even with the lid on the     i_wanted the glass for hot things  i actually brew my coffee straight into this and blend it   but it leaks  it s leaked more_than a_few times out_of the bottom  we tighten it and rescrew it on  but it s never 100   the plastic bottom is super cheap  and even with the lid on the liquid still shoots out_of the cracks  they just don_t make them like they used to  what did you expect for the_money  you got it  it s ok  i_mean  it s a cheap blender  but it has a glass pitcher  it works_fine  it seems_to_do a better job than_its predecessor at mixing frozen drinks with ice  probably as_good as_it gets for the_money  and if you want something better  more versatile  more powerful  etc  then you ll need_to fork over more cash i expect  quite satisfactory  copacetic  bueno  loud  so yes  it s a blender and it works     however  it s one_of the loudest blenders i_ve ever owned   sounds like a frickin  cessna reving up on the runway preparing for take off  can_t use it in the morning because_it wakes the entire household so am forced to_make smoothies in the evening and fridge store them  i suggest you choose another brand over this_one  well  what do you expect  no  it s_not elegant looking  and it is indeed loud  but what do you expect  black and decker is known for its loud  macho power tools  and basically that s what you have here   a loud  macho kitchen power tool  i appreciate the sturdy glass container and the fact that the basic design is a simple one  i_do recommend following the instruction book s advice to press the pulse button a_few times when blending frozen fruit or clunky items into a drink before setting it to a full blend  even doing that  though  smoothies can come out a_bit lumpy  for the_price  though  it s a bargain and does the job well enough  not as_good as a previous model of theirs for the_same     gets the job done  but noisy  not as_good as a previous model of theirs for the_same price  not intended for daily use no_complaints about it  it does the job    but if you are going_to_use it daily i_d buy a different one     gets the job done  meh  not the sturdiest thing_in the world but it does the job  the motor is also not the greatest  but i just needed something for a rental  so_i_m fine with it  not too powerful but does work  black and decker blender works_well  smoothie i was making was a_little too thick but the blade stopped  would recommend something a_little stronger  three_stars it works ok  makes smoothies with frozen fruit no problem  it is sort of loud not as efficient as my previous b  d  glass     not as efficient as my previous b  d  glass lip flaked off  my last blender  same mfg  flaked at bottom rim  leary of futher b   d blenders its obviously not a ninja and you have to be very smart about the order in which you place things or     its a decent blender it does what its supposed to  its obviously not a ninja and you have to be very smart about the order in which you place things or else its stops  while it does the job it also gets over heated     while it does the job it also gets over heated and the more i_use it  just for morning smoothies   the more it overheats and i_can smell plasticy stuff 
stalled at 6 speed  motor is_not powerful  the motor on this blender is horrible   i_tried using it saturday february 9th 2018 and it stalled on both the low and high settings at the 6 speed  the blades wouldn_t_even spin  it s_not worth the_cost  dis satisified customer i_tried_to blend soft cream cheese and it would go alittle bit and quit  it never did blend it  also there are ridges on the inside of the glass which make it very difficult to scrape things out and to clean  also the glass if very heavy like lead glass  do_not recommend this_product  i am very_disappointed in that it does_not ever crush ice so although the_price is right  and not much is to be expected  i am very_disappointed in that it does_not ever crush ice  i_use it for smoothies and it is able_to handle frozen fruit  but the ice never breaks down  also very loud  good_deal but    doesn_t chop very_well the kid is flimsy and the markings on the blender     the lid is very flimsy and the markings on the blender are all_in another language  french maybe  it does the job but i would steer clear if you can find a better option  two_stars it doesn_t do a_very_good job with 4 cup smoothies  leaves whole blueberries and ice cubes o ring broken in a_month  worked fine until today when the o ring got caught and started heavily smoking  we ve had this less_than a_month and cant use it due to the o ring  not enough blending power  will cause hearing damage  it is loud enough_to cause hearing damage when just blending a shake mix  it does_not have enough power to_get through ice or frozen fruits quickly  unit gets warm just making a protein shake with ice  
a disappointment   quit less_than 15 minutes out_of the_box  this was easily the weakest blender i_ve ever used  my last blender died after years of use  this_one arrived and looked promising  but died less_than 15 minutes into being out_of the_box  as always amzon is great about returns  and the blender has been returned  b d has some great_products  but this particular blender is definitely not among them  disappointed is an understatement  my next blender will be a different brand  terrible blender  spend a_few dollars more and get something that works properly worst blender i_ve ever purchased or used  the center plastic top doesn_t stay steady and if you have hot liquids in the decanter  you will burn yourself  you have to put a dishrag or something on top to_make sure your hands are protected  it s cheaply constructed  which makes sense given the_price  but it doesn_t_even function properly  by far the worst appliance i_ve ever bought by far the worst appliance i_ve ever bought  it has difficulty getting anything blended  from ice cream to fruit  one_star can_t use it for smoothies because_it can_t crush ice  returning it terrible rating for my terrible blender this blender is absolutely trash  i_wanted to have an eclectic blend of fruit smoothies  but ended up in disaster  the blades don_t work  the blender is slow  it is loud  and i am upset  i want_to_take my business somewhere else  if you want_to_get a_great blender  for a_great_price  do_not purchase this  lacks the blade really frustrated  sending back and will not purchase again for this waste of my time  first time_i_purchased from this brand and the experience was_not the_best  very_disappointed i just purchased this blender this month and tried_to_use it for the_first time yesterday  i washed it before using it put my peppers and oil in the blender and it just burst into pieces before i even started it  first time_i_purchased from this brand and the experience was_not the_best  very_disappointed  now_i have to purchase another blender  the jar leaked like a sieve the jar leaked like a sieve  therefore worthless  product was packed up_and returned for a refund  complete waste of my time  do_not_buy  one_star the_product get broken very_easy  one_star worst product purchased on_amazon  cracked after a_couple_of uses  very_disappointed 2 of them came defective black and deck  er     2 of them came defective black and deck er helped me not amazon  although i will not have the part from b and d it will be a_week  it is essentakl to my health or life which will both end sooner than lqter i hope
