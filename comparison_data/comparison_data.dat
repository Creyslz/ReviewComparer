great_value and picture  update  picture didn_t last  great_value for the_price  it is quite helpful that you can switch between the vga and hdmi inputs using either software or the second button on the front right underside next to the_power button  this monitor has very_good contrast of darks and lights  easy_to_set_up  angle it before attaching the cables   and has roughly a 60 degree viewing angle  30 degrees on either side of dead center  in which the picture remains sharp and clear  so people sitting off center or next to the main user will still see a crisp accurate picture  it s very light but also very stable  update  not good_value  it has been 2 months since purchase  the_screen now produces stray dark lines from top to bottom  it is_not the cable connection  if you pinch the black plastic frame around the_screen glass just below the dark line  the dark line disappears temporarily until you stop pinching below it  unfortunate that this monitor didn_t last beyond 2 months of limited use  no longer consider this a_good_value at_all  2nd update  manufacturer wants credit card info  through chat  to_replace the defective monitor still under warranty   instead_of providing means to ship it back  like a shipping label so you know you aren t getting charged hidden fees  before getting the replacement  it reads too much like a cc scam so not worth it  went bad in 1 year we have owned this monitor for one year  today  lines and distorted images appeared on the_screen indicating that it was going bad  upon calling tech support  they told us there would be a  59 99 fee for diagnostics  the_monitor only cost  99 so  no we are not going_to_do that  i think a monitor should last more_than 1 year  i_do_not recommend this_product  


perfect display  no is this a stunning  perfect display  no  not really  but it is perfect as a low cost secondary display for a laptop  i work from home frequently  and my little laptop screen wasn_t cutting it to connect_to the bigger dual monitor display setup i have on my desk at work  i_needed something that was fairly inexpensive  but would be easy on the eyes when i_m coding for work  i_bought it along with a vesa adapter and a mounting arm  because_i_like to put my secondary displays in portrait mode  and the stand it comes_with doesn_t do that  color and resolution seem pretty_good  the_back light is nice  there s a tiny bit of light bleed around the edge of mine  but i_use it in a fully lit room during daytime hours  so_it s_not bothersome  i_do wish that the place you put the vesa adapter or stand was more centered  because the_monitor is a_little wobbly  even on the arm i have it mounted on  otherwise  it s a solid monitor considering i only paid  100 for it  if you re looking_for some fancy display for watching high definition movies and_playing games  maybe this isn_t it  but if you need a second or third monitor for internet browsing   writing code   basic stuff  this is a_good choice  hesitant at first  found out great_for gaming  great monitor  i was little hesitant at first because_it s specs seemed a_little lower than others  such as contrast ratio and response time  i_m an avid gamer who needed a_new monitor right before college that wouldn_t burn a hole in my pocket  very_happy_with what i_got  i also thought 21 5 was a_little small for gaming  but it s pretty big in person and it ll definitely satisfy anyone who wants to watch movies or play games often  after about a_months use  i_ve encountered no problem  and only see quality  
great investment for a solid monitor    excellent monitor  as you can see from the photo  i_bought two of them  dual monitors are the_way to_go  multi tasking at it s best  since_it doesn_t have any audio outputs  i_use bluetooth from my laptop to a jbl charge 2 bluetooth speaker  amazing product for your wallet wow  this_product is amazing it makes my acer monitor look like crap  the color on the you tube video played on both monitors  left  acer  right  hp  it is another great_product made by hp  will buy_again  works_great though resolution not comparable_to the laptop 13 inch macbook compared to 21 5 inch monitor  just about the right size for me  works_great though resolution not comparable_to the laptop i was able_to purchase 3 hp pavilion 22cwa which looks awesome if_i_don_t mind saying  i initially started to look for an upgrade for 2010 mac mini  so when i started looking at the_prices for new_computers i was horrified lol  the more i looked into it i started to realize that i wasn_t getting a whole lot of bang for my buck to_replace my old computer  i looked into selling my old mac to_make up some of the_cost of a_new_computer  but the selling price was_not worth it and the worry of selling it to the wrong person made it a_good reason to keep it  i looked into upgrading my mac  the_prices of_ram had dropped dramatically since_i_purchased it  i was able_to purchase 3 hp pavilion 22cwa which looks awesome if_i_don_t mind saying  i_know eventually the mac will become obsolete one day but will have great set_up for the next computer  an monitor with outstanding value  i was looking_for a dual monitor setup for my new pc setup  and i had an old acer monitor which had a resolution i wasn_t happy_with  i_decided to search for a_good monitor for a price i could have a budget for  yet enjoy  i found this excellent ips monitor  this monitor arrived_in a clean box  and had instructions provided to properly setup the_monitor  with a clean sheet applied to the_screen to prevent light damage to the_screen in shipment  upon opening  i noticed it came_with a complimentary vga cable  didn_t use it  since_i prefer hdmi   the_monitor has two parts  a stand and the_monitor itself  this was easy_to_set_up as_well  and the sheet covering the_monitor depicted the connections to build it clearly  after setting the_monitor up  settings were easy_to navigate and configure  and in seconds i was logging into windows with a clear  crisp resolution which was much more pleasing to look at than my older acer  which has light bleed and some funkier older pixels and colors  my monitor was clear of dead pixels  and was overall just as_i_needed for anything from browsing to gaming at a comfortable 80fps  i am in the process of purchasing another monitor to_replace my older acer  thank you  stunning display not to be a 4k so_far i_love it  screen is just right for my limited space  a 1080p monitor with hdmi and ips is a steal at  100  its that simple people  see my pics  

the part where i am really disappointed is the speakers i_definitely didn_t expect the picture on this monitor to wow me at the_price point  and its decent  but nothing special the_monitor is thin ish   but the advertised bezels look way smaller than they are  although the plastic part of the bezel is thin  there s a gap between where the_screen ends and the bezel begins  leaving more dead space  the part where i am really disappointed is the speakers  they sound horrible  like a tiny cell speaker in a tin can  my old phone has a better speaker than this monitor  i_didn_t expect it to be great  but it s really so bad you don_t_even want_to listen to youtube videos on it  and definitely not any music you like  sucks because_i_got this monitor so_i wouldn_t have to_buy another set of desk speakers 

great_for viewing and gaming  not so_much on sound     i_ordered this monitor because_i_wanted to_make a makeshift area for my powerful  but old laptop  when i took it out_of the_box  i was_impressed by the size of the_screen  it s quite wide and sturdy so you have no fear of it wobbling around  so on to the testing  the hdmi and vga are good_for selection  i_use hdmi and turned it on  the images are gorgeous  the ips definitely makes the fhd shine thru and thru  images are vivid  movies are amazing  and you have plenty_of room to_see all_of your windows  everything was great    till i switched the sound from my laptop to the_monitor  they really dropped the ball there  i have to put the sound up on the_monitor_and my laptop to even hear anything  i barely have to turn up the sound on my laptop to hear it so_i_don_t know_if they put all their money into the_screen or decided the speakers were a last minute decision  so_if you plan on using this monitor with a tower pc  please have external speakers as your default because the_monitor speakers are mediocre  so for those looking_for a replacement monitor  a low price ips screen  or a productivity work some gaming screen  i_can suggest this to you  those looking_for a monitor with minimum fuss to it  i_can sortof recommend it to you because_it s easy_to_setup  but i strongly advise you to have external speakers in order to enjoy any sound while being hooked up to this monitor  for the_price  its amazing the thing to remember with this_product is you get what you pay_for  i am a second year finance major  and i was looking_for an additional monitor to_use with my laptop  all i would need it for is spreadsheets  word processing  and internet use  so_i_didn_t need a brand_new 4k 34in ultra wide whatever  i just needed a simple cheap monitor that would get the job done  and this did exactly that  no  it doesn_t have the_best resolution  and no it doesn_t have the_best color correctness  but you can_t compare a  120 monitor to a  1300 monitor  for a college student or home office this in my mind is the_best monitor you can get for the_money  and i fully intend to_get a second one  sweet monitor  sweet price  but needs instructions to adjust the pic sweet monitor  i_needed a_new 24  monitor with an hdmi connector  researched the hell out_of monitors  got it narrowed down to a_few great_deals  then realized that the great_deals i selected didn_t have height swivel adjustments  which i_wanted  best deals with adjustable stands came down to this item and acer vg245h  which has tilt adjustment but not height   so this seemed the most bang for the buck  it s sleek  crystal clear  and bezel is ridiculously thin  picture looked terrible on arrival  way way way too bright   like a tv in  showroom  mode  had to fuss with the picture adjustments a_good_deal to_get it to look like other monitors and get it out  eye burning  mode  i had to turn the brightness down from 80   which is how it was set on arrival  to about 20   i sure wish there had been some readily accessible instructions on how to adjust the picture for optimal viewing instead_of relying on trial and error  but no useful instructions were included  nor could i find anything online  i_m not talking about color calibration for professional photography or anything like that  just basic instructions appropriate for someone doing word processing  web surfing etc  so docking 1 star for that  include decent instructions for adjusting the_screen  or have it pre set for normal home office use   and i_d give 5_stars looks great  solid base  height adjustable  rotation  good_but not great image quality looks great_and nice design with thin bezels  solid stand  height adjustment  and rotation  there are claims being made about a swivel adjustment  but i_can_t get mine to swivel at_all unless i pick up the entire thing with stand and move it  which obviously is_not a swivel feature  if anyone know how to_get this_thing to swivel  please comment  i_deducted 1 star for image quality  it s good  but not great  i_expected better  but maybe at this price  this is as_good as_it gets  i_expected more brightness  although it is decently bright  and for an ips display  i_expected the colors to be more vibrant and have more  pop   netflix streaming is downright disappointing on this monitor  maybe it s the built_in intel hd graphics on the_computer that s to blame  all i_know_is that i have an asus gaming laptop with an ips display and the image quality blows this monitor away  i also had an older dell desktop with windows xp and an older dell standard  not ultrasharp  lcd monitor_and photos looked better on it  brighter  sharper  with better color gradations   so_image quality is pretty_good_but not great or outstanding on this monitor  but it does look really nice_and appears to be well made  a_good work monitor  audio and picture aren t of any high quality  but it can rotate between portrait and landscape without purchasing a  30 mount  only good_for a simple work setup  
superb monitor this laptop sits at just over 4 stars while some of the_other similarly priced and comparable monitors from spectre  lenovo  and other brands hover around 4 5_stars  this gave me pause  but after looking through many of the 1 3 star reviews it was clear that the majority had harshly penalized the_monitor due to its reportedly lackluster audio performance  my laptop has surprisingly decent sound so_i could essentially care less about the_monitor s speakers  now_if my laptop didn_t sound good then i would have simply connected my laptop to my bluetooth speaker  my old pc speakers  my blue tooth headphones  or hell even my surround sound if_i felt so_inclined  those reviews are overly demanding imo  first impression  time spent from opening the_box to having the_monitor up_and running was under 5 minutes  well designed packaging and easy_to put together   no screwdriver required  came_with both a hdmi and an aux cord    ok cool i appreciate that but whatever  first glance of the_monitor on my 38  x 24  desk and i_m satisfied_with its footprint  the_screen bezels are tiny which looks good_and helps manage size  another plus is how the base extends behind the_screen as opposed to extruding in front which would take up valuable real estate in front of the_monitor  the_monitor_and my laptop share the desk very_well  and there is even generous room for an open notebook directly in front of the_monitor  i_m glad that i_went with a 23 8  monitor over something like a 20 22  as that last 1 3 inches makes a noticeable difference in screen size  the design and style of the_product is very sleek and it looks great on my desk  it definitely doesn_t advertise its modest price tag with its expensive and luxury appearance  early performance  when i connected my laptop  a lightly upgraded lenovo t440p thinkpad  maybe a  400 laptop  via hdmi to the_monitor i was met with a large snowy owl staring at me  one_of the photos that windows cycles through before during log in   the picture was bright  edges were sharp  and the snow white feathers of the owl looked like a true pure white  the contrast between the white of the owl  its dark eyes and the brown of the tree was great_and_everything looked realistic and accurate  after logging in i_went into the_windows display settings and made a_few simple adjustments on how i_wanted the laptop to display to the_monitor  it was very_easy_and intuitive to_do  first thing_i_did was browse some hd youtube videos  a lord of the rings fight scene  and planet earth  and i was_immediately impressed  the_screen kept up with the intense action pace of the lotr fight without any lagging frames or stuttering  planet earth s tropical videos looked bright and accurately colorful while the following cave video was properly dark and intense with moments of brightness  here the speed of some of the small critters gave the_monitor a_little bit of blurring  especially when the color of the animal was similar to the color of the_background  i then switched over to netflix  browsed a_bit  and decided on planet earth again since the show has so many amazing spectacles to view  everything looked just as great_and in some cases even a_little bit better  the speed of the animals didn_t seem to blur as with youtube  note  i_didn_t watch the exact same video so this is highly anecdotal   when it came to reading text and more general browsing of the web i was pleased  letters had sharp corners  and the additional amount of text that fits on the_screen vs my 14  laptop made for less scrolling  happy_with the video playback i rotated the_monitor  set monitor to top height  grasp edges of screen  and twist it to the right  to portrait  the rotation felt smooth and solid  boy does it make for a long screen  but i_m confident i will use it when working with long lists of data  programming  using excel  etc  i am glad i will have the option  weaknesses  as mentioned before the sound is definitely weak  the volume is low  audio sounds pretty  shallow   and there just isn_t much to report there  in my mostly quiet apartment i could hear and understand the audio from the_monitor  but it admittedly wasn_t long before i reverted back to my laptop sound  nonetheless having an at least usable audio option as a back up is better_than nothing  i will generally award more points to any item that exceeds the expectations of its main function than_i will penalize a product for including an average to below average  extra  that is_not vital to performance  if my computer chair gave me a back massage i would be very pleasantly surprised  but if_it had a lumpy seat  didn_t spin smoothly  and was stuck at a certain height i wouldn_t be so pleased  i_ll choose the chair that i_can be comfortable in for hours  spins effortlessly and noiselessly  and adjusts height easily  i_can_t speak to using the_monitor for gaming and whether it can handle that demand as_i_don_t have the gaming tech knowledge  the gaming experience  or even a game to test it with  final pros  sleek aesthetic design  stand rotates landscape to portrait  tiny bezels  good brightness  dark blacks  efficient footprint  simple and smooth tilt height adjustments final cons  weak speakers  minor blurring at times of very_fast moving video  i highly_recommend it  i am very_happy_with this_purchase i am very_happy_with this_purchase  i_wanted a monitor with the speakers built_in and this has that  it is large with a clear picture  to contradict brady with the complaint about the lack of bright white on the_screen  the lack of bright white is actually better for the eyes  my old monitor had a brighter white than this_one  blue light damages the eyes and will keep you up at night as_well  it is really a matter of adjustment  you get used to what you use  blue light is bad for the eyes and there is concern that over time with so_much tv computer use and the led lighting that there will be more cases of macular degeneration  blue light also makes it hard to fall asleep  it is a quick adjustment period  perfect 10 10 would recommend this monitor is exactly what i was searching for  and exceeded my expectations  to be fair  i was upgrading from a dinky little 18 inch monitor with not a_lot of preference options  but nonetheless this_one_is amazing  the slim edges are perfect to grab another and have a near seamless dual display  the height tilt adjustment is easy as pie  and i look forward to being able_to_work at my desk while standing  without the help of expensive desk platforms   i_m also_impressed by the_quality of the_screen and the 6 different viewing modes  which includes custom adjustments  i_use my screen for gaming  movie watching  and photo editing graphic design  and i_d say that it is well designed for all_of them  when i say 10 10 would recommend  it s_not for the sake of using a meme or being ironic  i truly mean it  yep love it  love love love this monitor  i am a photographer and when just in my editing program i_do_not have to zoom in to_see the pores in the skin on a head shot  if you have a_problem with it flipping don_t waste your time calling hp for help they have no idea how to fix it you just have to turn it manually in your display menu  the difference from my gaming laptop to this monitor 


nice budget item but don_t have sky high expectations i_got two  to outfit a part time office i am opening in another city and will use a_couple days per week  budget  so the budget price was a big plus  contents faulty  the_boxes are advertised on the_box as containing  power_cord   vga cord   one box came_with 2 hdmi cables and zero power cables  this isn_t a deal killer  you may have too many spares already or they are  7 at an office store  the_other box came_with one power_cord  one vga cord  and one hdmi cord  more_than the_box listed  mount  be aware these are very simple flat monitors on a_very simple budget plastic stand   no fancy height or angle features  i put them on a paper ream to be a_couple inches higher  inputs  they do have a_nice triplet set of vga   dvi   hdmi input sockets  there is also a standard little audio patch plug  but if you drive it off hdmi the audio is built_in to the hdmi cable  speaker  it s quite tinny to the point of being sort of unpleasant  but there is one  contrast  the contrast may not be so great   lettering on these monitors looks  gray  compared to  sharp black  on my lenovo laptop native monitor  it s usable but won_t look good compared to a monitor that could easily be double or triple the investment  if you stop comparing monitors and just use this_one your eyes adapt  resolution  on a lenovo x1 gen4   you have two video outputs  a standard hdmi and a minidisplayport  either offered to drive the_monitor up to 1920x1080 with the lenovo recommended you choose 1600x900  also  fyi  if you have a laptop hdmi and or a laptop minidisplayport for low cost from amazon you can get the cable of choice with any other output on the far end  hdmi  displayport  dvi  vga  etc   good monitor for the_price  but the stand doesn_t come off  ordered 7 of these monitors  none had dead pixels or flaws  display is fine  the biggest issue i had with these monitors is that vertical part of the stand cannot be removed  i was very surprised to find that the horizontal base comes off and that s it  i_mounted these displays on an articulating wall mount using the 100mm vesa mounting holes  as a result  the vertical piece sticks down behind and below the_monitor  bottom line  if you re wanting to mount this monitor  you ll have and unattractive black  handle  sticking down  
best for the_price  not a superstar  for the_price  i_don_t think this can be beat  i_bought two of these  and spent about the_same amount of money as_if_i were to_buy a decent 24  monitor  they re a_little small  but not bad from a foot or so away  the number of inputs is awesome  but i would prefer 2 hdmi over 1 hdmi  vga  and dvi  today s devices primarily use hdmi  the speakers are  eh  not impressive  at least they re there  unlike a_lot of monitors  but the volume is limited and the_quality is poor  don_t buy this for the speaker  my biggest complaint is that neck that goes into the base is_not  easily  removable  so  if you plan to mount this on a wall or stand  like me  then you ll have an unsightly black neck sticking out the bottom  i_ve read you can remove the_monitor frame and unscrew the neck  but i_tried this and wasn_t able_to separate the frame without feeling like i was going_to break something  its inexpensive but the neck cannot be removed this monitor was_inexpensive and works ok if youre going_to_set it on a desk  if you plan on using a vesa wall mount  be aware that the neck is actually attached to the_monitor_and cannot be removed   see my pics  this means youll have an ugly looking chunk of plastic hanging from under the_monitor  i still cant decide if_i want_to keep it since the_monitor was very inexpensive  or if_its going_to hurt my eyes too much to_see the glaring eyesore under the_monitor due to it being wall mounted with the base removed  i wish i had noticed this before purchasing because_i_definitely would have picked a different monitor  other_than the weird neck issue  the_monitor works and looks great   especially when using it with the base on a flat surface  im using the hdmi port on the_back but it also has vga to connect_to your pc  i played with the_monitors menu and it has options to adjust a_few different settings  i_liked that it had warm cool normal etc  view settings  i am using it to view my security cameras so no other adjustments were needed for my situation  the built_in speaker were a bonus and work fine for basic sounds tests  an fyi if you are going_to wall mount it   i searched the q a before purchasing and received conflicting info on the vesa size for this_unit  i_purchased a  20 articulating wall mount that would work for either 75mm or 100mm spacing  after installing the mount   monitor today i noted it used the wider spaced holes so_it does appear to need a 100mm vesa mount  good_value for the_money  but not the equivalent of an hp or dell computer monitor i paid  49 for this monitor  so_i_can_t complain  but  for the benefit of readers  i will point out three things   1  it came_with a vga cable  which you probably want_to_replace with a dvi cable  or hdmi if you don_t mind setting audio every time you connect the_monitor    2  the video quality is good  but not as_good as what you might see on an hp or dell computer monitor   3  the height of the_monitor is_not adjustable  good_value  speakers are useless  leg can be removed it is a_good monitor for the_money  i_bought it as a second monitor so_i could connect it to my dvr and watch tv while  working  at my computer  vga and hdmi inputs are a big plus  the speakers are next to_useless  they face away from the user and are not loud enough  i was a_bit concerned about the unremovable stand but decided not to worry about it since_i was just going_to_set it on my desk anyway  now_i have bought a dual monitor stand and decided to_see if the  leg  could be removed  if nothing else i would just saw it off  what the heck it is just a  70 monitor  i removed the four screws on the_back  pried off the bezel  lifted up the_screen  and there were the screws that hold the leg on  i removed them and put the_monitor back together the_monitor looks great on the stand and i_can always put the leg back on later  perfect_for pi projects great little monitor to_do raspberry pi projects with  my only complaint is where the_power port and hdmi ports are located  instead_of being located on the bottom of the_monitor  where they could be tied together and hidden   they are located on the left and right of the components box  so your power_cord and hdmi cable are hanging off the left and right of the_monitor  it s just ugly is what i_m saying  
it has bonus features  works beautifully  i was a_bit mystified when i heard sound coming from it  apparently this monitor has speakers built_in  so that s a fun bonus i_didn_t know_i had  they re a_bit tinny but that s to be expected given their size and location  on the_back_of the_monitor   for reference i_use an hdmi cable with mine  i_cannot speak to the_way it might work_with a vga cable  i_don_t believe it came_with the hdmi cable so do be aware of that  also be aware that it will be the default speaker for your computer unless you go into your sound settings and turn that off  do this before you embarrass yourself like i_did lol  the_power light is blue led and blinks when the_computer_is off but the_monitor is still on  which bothers me  i hate blinking lights  so_i turn it off at night  whereupon the light just glows a_nice friendly red  the stand is sturdy and easy_to snap together  though i am always gentle with my electronics because well  why wouldn_t you be  it s a steal at  70 it s impossible to find a better hdmi_monitor  there were zero dead pixels on the_one that i_got and the image is incredible  a_couple side notes  1  it can have up to 7 dead pixels without qualifying for a replacement under the manufacturer warranty  if this is a big deal to you then maybe consider spending more_than  70 for a monitor  2  the stem that mounts into the base is_not easily removable  if you are going_to wall mount this_unit  plan on prying open the shell to remove that stem  fantastic monitor   no regrets  received my new monitor today and have been using it for several hours now_and i_can_t rave enough about it  i hooked it up via hdmi port and it setup on my nvidia gtx 750ti graphics_card without a hitch no resizing of the desktop was needed as_it would be if you had it hooked up to a tv  the picture is clear and colors are bright just as you would expect from hdmi  all factory presets of the_monitor is perfect_for me  i am a gamer and it has no lag in the rapidly changing pictures that occur during a long gaming session but at 5ms i wouldn_t expect it to  power pack is self contained inside the_unit itself so there s no extra pack taking up space on your desk a real plus to me since_i hate desktop clutter  and the sound is pretty decent for being built_in speakers on a monitor  which really don_t bother me because_if_i play farm sim 2017 it is loud enough for me to hear the games sounds  and if_i am playing something like fallout 4 i prefer a headset anyway since those game sounds bother my wife  and i prefer the ability to hear things coming at me from all angles up close and personal as compared to even the_best desktop speakers  i have no regrets buying this monitor_and at a sub  100 price tag and it being a 20  widescreen it can_t be beat  

it s okay   not great but not bad   update   i_don_t like it  the_best thing about this monitor is the_price  however  you get what you pay_for  the amazon 3 star rating of  it s okay  very accurately describes how i feel about this_product  the color is ok  i was actually a_bit disappointed in this because_i selected an ips monitor for the better color reproduction   viewing angles are ok  should be a_lot better on an ips   light bleed is a_bit stronger than_expected based on other reviews  especially in the lower corners   resolution is a plus but not very noticeable at 25   again   it s okay    minimal ghosting  some is expected w  60hz refresh   the_monitor looks nice  the chrome accents really make it look like a high end item  the stand is garbage but i_expected that based on other reviews so_i_didn_t hold it against acer in this review  to quantify how bad the stand is  typing on the_keyboard shakes the_monitor   so that minimal amount of impact on a solid desk makes the_monitor shake  the stand is like a point load in the center with a set of training wheels on either side that_allows it to wobble but keeps it from falling down  when i get home i_ll try to_take a picture of the light bleed and post  update  i have attached pictures of the light bleed  my keyboard_and_mouse are lit up_and you can see the_monitor is actually brighter than those when showing a black screen  its pretty bad  also  while gaming and facing the_monitor straight on  the color in the bottom corners gets washed out  not_sure if anyone else has experienced this since other reviews praise this monitor for great color function so_i_m not_sure if what i am experiencing is normal or if_i just have a bad item  but i have changed my review from it s okay  to  i_don_t like it     i_may send it back  additional clarity to review  my previous monitor was a 20  1920 x 1080 with ppi of 110 15  this monitor equates to a ppi of 117 49  as stated above  not very noticeable  to me    others may have a different experience coming from a different monitor  to_add to this  some text fonts look blurry on this monitor  my previous monitor had no_issues_with any text  i_don_t need my eyes checked   this monitor is average at best  which agrees with the ideology  you get what you pay_for   
stay away from acer the gripes i have about this display has taken my rating down to 3 stars  got the_monitors  color reproduction actually amazed me  coming from acer especially  i_didn_t have any backlight bleed worth complaining about  and i_m picky  just poor viewing angles  for ips  unfortunately so   the_backlighting panel behind the lcd display was shifted leftward  when i had these both angled with the_monitors meeting directly in front of me  this caused a  translucent  effect on the right side of the displays  if the_backlight panel was slightly wider  or just positioned more to the center  this wouldn_t be an issue  i_bought 2 monitors and both had the_backlight panel shifted left  so_it was either a bad lot  or poor quality control  also  no vesa mount  so my double sided tape method only worked for a_few days before it began to peel  tried two different style tapes from 3m   i think i_m staying far away from acer  last year i_bought one_of their  premium  laptops and ended up returning it about a_week into owning it because of a fan issue  acer just makes budget products  plain and simple  don_t expect much quality  
great monitor once you use the tilt feature i felt a_bit sorry for this monitor on_amazon taking all this heat from a lack of tilt and i_m here to_set the record straight  i_purchased this_product at a black friday event where i was only looking_for 3 features within my price range  1  full hd 2 led 3 22    when lined up with other products  this_one stands out in terms of specifications and price  once home  it connected to both my blue ray player and computer_with ease  the_quality from blue ray is outstanding with a high speed hdmi  dvi cable  the_only issue was the lack of tilt  for the_first few days i was stacking reams of paper to_get a proper height adjustment and to obtain the optimal viewing angle  how could acer make a high tech monitor with no tilt   answer  they did  having been spoiled for the past 20 years with easy tilting built_into every computer screen encountered  this acer requires you pop off the stand  and with a screw driver and wrench  tweek the stand frame to your desired angle and retighten  easy  it takes less_than 3 minutes  this is a fantastic buy  the_quality is as_advertised  and if your video_card supports two monitors  buy a second one for a full panoramic experience  i hope you enjoy  
triple monitor heaven just purchased 3 of these monitors and they look amazing see for yourself in my picture   great_buy_for a_great_price  excellent monitor especially for the_price  i have had no problem with this monitor in fact ive had one for a year now_and i just bought another when i_ordered my computer to build  these monitors side by side look great_and perform great as_well  i am hoping to_get a mount for my desk when i am able_to and these will be able_to mount because they have the vesa mounting spots on the_back_of the_monitor  exceptional monitor  happy customer   very_happy_with this_purchase  my cat knocked over my old dell 24  lcd monitor_and the warranty expired two months before  i_did_not wanna pay_for another low quality monitor  i work from home most weekends so this was an emergency  since_i had some money left on my amazon gift card  i_used that to_buy this monitor  i_used this monitor at my former job except i think it had to be a 19   it also had an hdmi port  this_one does_not  but because_it comes_with the vga cord and the largest white cord  i easily plugged it into my docking station and after fiddling with the_screen resolution it works_perfectly  i am okay with the fact that it does_not tilt  i have no_complaints about the resolution  a_lot of reviews seem to be nitpicking about the tilt and resolution but instead_of being cheap    just search for a monitor that tilts and has_good resolution  reading is fundamental  update  it tilts slightly up_and down  regardless  still a_great monitor once you go 1440p  you don_t go back  must buy_for non or light gamers  heavy gamers read on  i_ve been saving money to upgrade my 32  720p tv even though it s still going strong for almost 4 years because  1  it s on my desk and it takes up a_lot of space 2  while 720p is easier on my graphics_card  the image quality basically cancels out how easily i_can max out most settings on modern games  i would say when i_m at a monitor  1 3 of the_time_i_m gaming the_other 2 3 are just basic web browsing and youtube consumption  720p on a 32 inch tv sitting less_than 6 feet from it would probably make most enthusiast pc gamers either cringe or cry  or both   i knew that while the 2 3rds i spend doing non gaming activities would benefit from a higher resolution  my gpu would choke on it  i have been eyeing this acer monitor because of how affordable it is  get it at  279  definitely get it right now at  249  and because_it s a 1440p resolution which is higher than the standard 1080p  so does paying less equal less quality  with this monitor  i think not  i will list the pros and cons briefly and go into more detail below  pros  very bright  i believe it s at 80 at default which is okay in the daytime but at night it s way too bright and i found 45 to be a sweet spot   ips display  vibrant colors at wide viewing angles  everyone needs an ips monitor unless you are those competitive gamers who need 144 hz monitors that right now are great_for multiplayer games but have terrible colors and poor viewing angles   very affordable  a_lot of high end 1080p monitors are around this price_and while most are around  150  200  i feel it s worth extra to_go to 1440p especially if you do more web browsing than gaming  neutral quality  my monitor came_with absolutely no dead pixels and very faint backlight bleed common for ips displays  i_guess i won_the_monitor lottery  this will vary  but my experience was positive however i will leave this_as a neutral as_not all panels are made the_same  mine was made in april of this yer   cons  very flimsy stand  yes the_other reviewers are right  the stand is quite bad  when you try to adjust the vertical height of the_monitor it will shake  you can_t adjust it horizontally nor can you turn it sideways like the dell ultrasharp s  it is easy_to_install the stand though    no vesa mounts  ties into the flimsy stand because you re stuck with that stand  some people will find a lack of vesa mounts to be a nonstarter  for me  i_can live with a flimsy stand when everything else about this monitor is a solid a   in the_box it comes_with a dvi cable and an hdmi cable but not a display_port cable  something to note  so_if you re not a gamer  the rest of this review you can skip  i will say to_buy this monitor if you aren t a gamer because of the affordability  and the great display at 1440p resolution  now  for the gamers  the higher the resolution the more your fps is decreased  if you absolutely must have a solid 60fps experience  you will need at least a gtx 970 or a r9 290x if you re okay with dialing down some key settings like aa and shadows for 60fps or a gtx 980 ti or what amd is going_to release on july 16th at e3 if you want_to have your cake and eat it too  max everything and solid above 60fps   i have a amd r9 270  which is definitely on the lower end of the gpu spectrum so how does it fare at 1440p  playing a demanding game like the witcher 3  i_can max out some settings  dial down the foliage distance  huge fps eater  and get rid of hairworks  even bigger for amd and nvidia cards  and i_can get a solid 30fps  it s_not 60  but if you re of the graphics   fps affinity  you can definitely use a lower end gpu at 1440p like the r9 270  280 and for nvidia the 960  it s up to you what you want more of  but what is_not disputable is just how much of a steal this monitor is and it will make your games look like you re actually in them  i stared at the witcher 3 for almost 10 minutes just because how gorgeous it looks and why ips monitors are always superior to other panels  1440p is_not as big of a jump as 4k  but it is a big improvement over 1080p  the question is  do you need a_new graphics_card or not  it is overclockable_to 85hz in case anyone_is wondering you can oc this minister to 85fps and i saw this was confirmed by someone else as_well in an answered question  for nvidia users its easy_to into nvidia control panel not geforce experience   then go to change display  click customize display  check enable resolutions_not exposed by the display and click create custom resolution  you can do any resolution you want up to even the native resolution of 2560 x 1440p at 85 hz  keep on progressive and automatic timing works_fine  i_know_it works on display_port and if_i remember right dvi as long as_its dual link  i_m not_sure about hdmi  amd users can do it as_well but not through the catalyst  just google cru monitor overclocking utility  after you download the software you extract the contents and set your resolution to whatever you want and hz to 85 and after you add it go back to the cru utility files you just dled and reset the display driver and you re good  from there change your refresh rate how you normally would  this is an awesome inexpensive 2k monitor  i plan on buying a second one  i_ve only had this monitor for 2 day  however since there are barely any reviews for this_product  i shall state my initial impressions  this really is a gorgeous monitor  so_far i haven_t come across any issues  one customer stated that they had dead pixels right off the bat  however i_do_not  so  they other customer may have just gotten one_of the few bad monitors  though i suppose it s also possible that i_m one_of the few who got a_good monitor  only time will tell when more people buy the_product and more reviews are written  anyways  i_definitely recommend this monitor  it s one_of the least expensive 2k monitors and yet it s specs are pretty_good_and it is pleasing to the eye  with such a tiny bezel  this monitor is great_for people who like using multiple monitors  plus  unlike the acer g257hu  you can_tilt the_screen without messing around with screws and the_price is lower  i surely plan on buying another by the end of this year  most of the_other monitors i saw around this price were from lesser known brands  they were terribly ugly  and the specs were a tad worse  great picture quality at the_price that wont break you  i_needed a monitor to attach to my laptop when i take my work home  this_one fits the budget so_i_thought i_d give it a try  upon receiving the item i immediately inspected the physical built of this monitor_and i was surprise that it does_not look cheap at_all  in fact  it looks even better_than other monitors i_ve seen from local stores which cost twice as much  but the more important part of this review is the image quality  i am no expert but this monitor makes everything look better_than the laptop it s connected too  the white is pure white unlike other monitors i_ve seen where white is too bluish or yellowish  adjusting the picture quality is very_easy  i_didn_t_even need_to read the manual  i_ve been using this monitor for months now_and i have nothing bad to report  if you are looking_for an inexpensive monitor that provides good picture quality  i recommend you try this  i_do t use it for gaming but for work use and occasional movie watching it is more_than enough  this is definitely a_good_purchase for me
