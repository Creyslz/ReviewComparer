video review  awesome bang for your buck  folds up compact  decent quality  and they look awesome  video review  yes  they work_with glasses  decent bang for your buck  if you listen closely there s a_bit of  fuzz  noise  but that is drowned out once the music video starts playing  these are the_best headphones i_ve tested  and i_ve tested a_lot  when it comes to latency  that is there s no delay when viewing a_video on my iphone and the audio that s playing  note  there s quite a delay when pressing siri  like a_good 3 4 seconds before she s  activated   wear them daily pros  comfortable on my large head  no headphone has ever covered my ears without hard places or sweaty or too tight  these are good_for hours 2  battery seems_to last many hours  lost track 3  pairs easily with my moto g 4 phone and also a bt transmitter connected to my chrome tv dongle  easily xfer back and forth 4  clean  rich sound  nice break from my ear buds  5  build quality acceptable for this price  soft earpads and padded cross support  buttons gave solid response  ear cups are flat enough_to lay head on pillow to watch tv  6  adjustable enough_to find perfect comfort position  7  good volume and surround and noise rejection cons  none  we ll see how they hold up to long daily use update 9 30 2017 i wear these for several hours each day  holding up well  battery still holds good long charge  i added moleskin to the earpads to_make them a_little more comfortable  ear holes could be a tad bigger for my head and ears  overall still the_best headphones i have owned  great purchase fantastic head phones  they stay charged forever  i had them fully charged and used them for an hour on average 6 times a_week and did_not need_to charge them again for a_month  the_only complaints i have is when doing certain exercises they tend to slide off my head a_little so_i have to adjust them a_few times  mic doesn_t_work the mic doesn_t_work properly  others can barely hear my voice  update 04 06 2017  customer_service did pretty_good job and fast  by contacting me about the issue i had  they even re order a_new_one for me  now everything_is work perfect as_i_expected  thank you and keep up the good work  great headphones for the_price my wife took over my  300 head phones so_i_needed to find something that was ok and won_t break the bank  these headphones sound just as_good as my  300 set for the most part  they aren t as strong in the bass but they still hold their own as far as_i_m concerned  they are very comfortable over my ears and are easly adjustable also the battery seems_to last long enough for me before i_need_to recharge  they are not noise canceling but do block out enough outside sound that i_can forget the world around me and enjoy my music  now the_only problem i have is she want s these and says i_can have my old headphones back    go figure    very_nice value for bluetooth headphones  foldable   wired and wireless   good build quality  need a_nice value bluetooth headphones with durability  good sound quality    can be wireless or wired  this mpow headphone_is it   unit operational test  this is a pretty simple unit to test  i started with testing fitment   adjustment to my head using the sliders  stainless steel sliders  nicely done   while also testing the ability for folding the headphones  worked_great  very solid feeling   the memory foam ear cushions and along the inside of the headphone band where the top of your head will touch feel very comfortable with good spring in the foam  it is an attractive set of headphones  good use of contrast red  silver  and black  the device is touted to not be active noise canceling so we ll test passive noise reduction with the over the ears cushions  the device has user controls on one side  power  volume up  volume down  track forward  track reverse  play   pause  on the right ear side  my test  1  turn_on the headphones     you ll heard a clear voice  power on  message  2  turn_on bluetooth on your phone and pair the mpow headphones   connect  3  start up your preferred music or audio smartphone app  4  operate the headphones  connected and streaming from your bt enabled phone  for 10 hours continuous streaming and wired mode  using the supplied 3 5mm audio cable  along with conducting a test phone call  then power off the headphones  i_used my primary phone  a_new nexus 6p as my initial test  i turned on the headphones  the headphones provide an initial  powering on  along withe a  not paired  audio cue   then paired the device and connected by phone using bluetooth  yet another audio cue  phone 1 connected    i next started up one_of the music apps  eureka  it works   sound quality is quite good especially at this price  little emphasis in the mid band imo   i_can confirm no active noise cancellation but with the nature of the ear cushions i_did experience reduce ambient noise when the headphones were on and in use  sound can get loud but yet clear  no distortion nor crackling   which is nice to_see  you won_t get thumping base or highs  but that s to be expected  i next disconnected from bluetooth and attempted to test wired connection using the supplied 3 5mm audio cable that was supplied by mpow to connect_to my phone s headphone jack  the mpow worked well in wired mode  very handle to have both wired and wireless modes  i lastly powered off the headphones  nice touch for an audio  powered off  confirmation cue   my next test was to_make 2 phone calls  one to my home landline phone and one to my cellular voicemail   calls were very clear and quite loud  with the headphone volume turned all the_way up   and everyone could hear me fine using the built_in mic  this test completed successfully as_well   recharging  the mpow bluetooth headphones offers built_in rechargable battery  420 mah  that is rated to last up to 13 hours of continuous music time or 15 hours of talking time  i_ve done a test with the headphones running while streaming music using bluetooth  my test ended after 10 hours and it was still running  that s more_than enough run time for me  i tested recharging as_well using the micro usb port  found on the_same side as the user controls   you ll see a red led light come on   it took me several hours for a full recharge after using for 10 hours straight in my music playback test   build quality  very solidly built device  not in the_same league materials wise as bose but also not in the_same price range  good use of sturdy plastics  memory foam as the ear cushion  stainless steel for the adjustable sliders  the_unit s folding capability also worked well  very solid feeling along the hinges  good fit and finish overall   conclusion  this mpow bluetooth headphones over ear delivers in what they said this device could do  it connects seamlessly to your bt enabled phone and can play streamed audio but also can accept a wired connection  no battery charge needed in wired mode    the headphone design is foldable  great_for travel   storage in general   it s a solidly built and comfortable_to wear device  mpow offers a 45 day money back guarantee and a 18 month worry free guarantee as_well  i_ve not yet needed to_take advantage on the_other mpow items i_ve bought in the past  all are working_great   i would happily recommend these headphones to friends and family  especially for the value   flexibility to_use in wireless or wired mode  mpow bluetooth headphones over ear  hi fi stereo wireless headset  foldable  soft memory protein earmuffs  w  built_in mic and wired mode for pc  cell phones  tv  30 is cheap for five_stars  glory hands  i waited over a_month to write this review because_i_thought no way could these headphones actually be this good_for the_price  but i_use them all day everyday and i have never been more impressed with headphones under   50    i have sensitive ears with headphones and am super picky but these are so comfortable i_can sleep in them  noise reduction is great when something_is playing  pretty crummy though when there s no audio  fast charge  easy_to pair bluetooth or wire jack  play pause and fwd rwd buttons are handy  overall definitely worth the buy  highly_recommend  mom and teen approved   birthday gift for our 19 year_old son who keeps either breaking the headphones or they crap out on him after a_few months  he loves the bluetooth and that they are over the ear     as do i  they fold up as_well  although he hardly ever takes the_time to_do so during the few hours that he actually doesn_t have them on  one_of the main reasons i_purchased this kind had to_do with wanting him not to have them shoved inside his ears for these long periods of_time  so   win win here  they seem to be holding up to him so_far which says a_lot actually lol  thank you   truckers choice for talk and media truck driver  i_bought these to be able listen to audio books etc  while driving my big rig  love being able_to answer phone at the touch of a button  pleasant female voice says  you have an incoming call  while media is on  noice cancellation is great  everyone hears me well through the invisible mike  comfortable  well constructed  loud  and has a cord jack so my wife can quickly use them on her iphone when she rides along without pairing to blue tooth  excellent product  extreamly happy_with my bluetooth headset  this is my second pair of over the ear bluetooth headsets  i was looking_for a comfortable fit with decent sound  soft padding for ears and padding for top of the head comfort  my last over the ear headset would get uncomfortable after about 30 min these met every aspect i was looking_for  the sound quality for over the ear bluetooth headphones really are above average for this price range in my opinion  battery longetivity is superb for the amount of sound streaming for both speakers  bluetooth paring has been one_of the_best of any bluetooth  device i_ve ever had the pleasure of oning  it can be paired with multible devices simultaneously  i have it paired with my 2011 imac    also my ipad air 2  and iphone 7 plus  with no connectivity issues  can be hard wired to any device with cable provided  if battery power is lost  control sound  pause or track both play  and reverse from the right side of the headset  i have nt had the opportunity to_use the microphone for phone conversations  i_purchased them for music  nice feature in the future if_i_use it i will update my review  i_don_t dote on sound  as long as_it s streaming clear sounding music i_m content   the mpow bluetooth met every expectation i was looking_for and more  extremely happy_with my purchase  love them so_far i_ve only had these for an afternoon but i already love them  i have a large head and certain headphones pressing into my ears or scalp cause migraines  so_far  these have felt very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent  i was able_to easily pair them with my nexus 5  i_m still figuring out how to pair them with my asus chromebook  they are circumaural  cover the ear completely  and build quality seems good_for the_price  i_bought these to_replace a pair of wireless sennheiser rd160s that stopped working  i will update this review if these give me trouble after i get more use out_of them but i am already impressed with them  given the_price  replacement works_great i_received the item in a timely fashion  i unpacked it and read the user manual  then i charged it  the red light came on and in a_couple_of minutes it went out  i_thought maybe it had been charged and was still holding the charge  i was able_to pair it with my ipad  i listened to two tunes and then a full half hour of a britcom on youtube  then the battery was done  i recharged it and had a similar experience  i just returned it for a refund  be advised that you may or may not get one that works  the_company contacted me and said they would like to send me a replacement  i_received the replacement and charged it  it took about 3 5 to 4 hours to charge  i then paired it with my ipad  i listened to some of my music about two cds worth  i then watched about three of my favorite britcoms on you tube  the audio quality was outstanding  i listened to music or watched you tube tv shows and some music tutorials for the next week and a half  i even had them on for 7 5 hours one day  i planned to wait until they needed charging before i wrote the review  they are still going strong  the fit is good_and very comfortable  now about the sound  i already said that it was outstanding  i compared them to my sennheiser cable head set  i honestly could not tell the difference  i then compared them to bose wireless there was a_very slight difference but not much  overall they are extremely good  if you have trouble with them contact the_company and see what they can do  i_love them and could not be happier ron best headphones these headphones are perfect  customer_service superb     broke after just four months poor mechanical design    okay they sent me a replacement free of charge    i have no other recourse but to give them 5_stars for customer_service    it may have been just a fluke that they broke the_first time    thank you mpow buy the_way the sound quality is real good    husband loves them  i was very very excited to_get these based off the reviews i read here  and though the sound quality is great  it hurts my head when i have them on even for 15 minutes  it feels like it s clamping on the sides of my head  ouch   other_than that  i think they sound great   update   1 11 18  patazon contacted me after i complained about the mpow 059 s hurting my jaw head  and they were amazing  they apologized and offered me the newer version of these headphones  mpow h1   https   www amazon com dp b076hpb1hq  which are supposed to provide more comfort for longer use  i just received those today  and have been using them on and off for hours  no_complaints whatsoever    i_love them  they sound just as great as the 059 s and i feel zero discomfort  they re very soft against the ears and sound amazing  the song i_like to_use to test out headphone quality is believer by imagine dragons  d i_didn_t want the_other pair to_go to waste so my husband decided to_use them  and he says he feels zero pain with them  so perhaps my head is too small    we are both very please with our new headphones  and i am even more impressed with the customer_service from patozon  i have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while i have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while  and decided on these  i looked at bose soundlink ii  beats studio wireless  skullcandy crusher wireless  sony xtra bass wireless  and more  i finally decided to_get these  after realizing that  200  was just too much for headphones  i have yet to be disappointed  these headphones are  most noticeably  built surprisingly well  they are a glossy black with red trim  and the red is a soft rubbery feeling  the sliding mechanism is stainless steel  and the folding has a tactile  click  into place when opened  the audio is good  it s_not mind blowing  nor is the bass  but it s fairly well rounded and a solid performance  especially for anything_in this price range  for the_price  they re amazing  i_ve used the mic for only one phone call  the_other caller was unaware but did_not complain and i never had to repeat myself  so_i_guess it works_well enough though that s_not why i_bought them  the headphones pair easily enough with two devices  and can play from either one at a time  powering off if slightly awkward  as_it tries to_go into pairing before finally shutting off  holding the_power call pause play button   these headphones come_with an aux cable_to connect them to a standard headphone jack  which was an absolute requirement for me  as_i_don_t want_to be reliant on a battery all_of the_time  they seem to sound slightly better when connected with the_backup audio cable  but that might just be my prejudice  the wireless function  if already turned on  will silently deactivate power off when the aux cable is connected saving the battery  however  because of that  you lose audio talk controls when using the aux cable  not a big deal  most wired headphones don_t control the music  battery life is rated at 12 hours  but i_cannot accurately judge that as_i usually use them wired  projected battery life based on what i_ve used would seem that a 12 hour rating is probably pretty accurate  i havent drained them down past 80  according to my iphone s battery display  yes when paired with iphone_it will give the headset s battery level  overall  i am ecstatic with these headphones  they even come_with a_nice velvety drawstring bag to pack them in when not in use  good sound  good comfort  good battery life  good features  great_price  a friend of mine recommended the ear bud type headphones of this brand these are the most badass pair of headphones  a friend of mine recommended the ear bud type headphones of this brand  but ear buds tend to fall out_of my tiny ears  these had solid reviews and thankfully came_in a color other_than red black  so_i snatched them up  awesome purchase  sound quality is awesome  they fit over my ear  so they effectively cancel out noise unless someone were to come right_up to me and speak  i_don_t think i could hear them if_i had music playing  they also came_with an aux cord and charging cable but no wall plug  fyi and they came_with a pretty sweet gray suede    carrying case  no_complaints whatsoever  however  i should mention that i haven_t had them long enough_to test out the battery seeing as_i only got them yesterday and would never want_to wear them for 12  hours  awesome sauce i_m not a techy or a gamer  so this is just your average person s review  i_love these because they are completely around the ear  your ear ends up in a_little soft house   they are comfortable for my bigger than average head  i_can wear them with my large plastic framed glasses without issue  the controls on the side are great  they are mic wireless and speaker wireless  they are easy_to_set_up with both pcs and macs  i am using them across several devices at home and at work   they are rechargeable  no more need for constantly consumed batteries   and there is_not any sound leakage  for the_money  these headphones are awesome  i_m seriously glad that i_purchased them  very impressed this is my first experience with bluetooth wireless headphones and i am impress  i have nightmares about getting my old bluetooth cell phone to pair with the audio in my 07 camry  but these paired up to my iphone 7  immediately  i also purchased the daykit mini usb bluetooth csr 4 0 dual mode  a steal at under 7 bucks  and the mpow headphones paired up with my pc instantly  the sound quality is decent although it won_t blow you away with extremes of volume or bass  for average listening though  they are more_than adequate and they are wicked comfortable_to wear  take them off every hour or so  so your ears can breathe though    the_only issue i_ve had  and it s_not the fault of the mpow people is that when i run itunes on my win10 pc it gets way confused and i have to turn bluetooth off  exit itunes  then turn bluetooth back on and restart itunes  since_i have other networked devices in the house  itunes sees them on the network  but it doesn_t show them as an option  i have to select the  my computer  to_get it to_work  a minor inconvenience  but i blame apple  bottom line  if you want a_very decent pair of really inexpensive  but quality made bluetooth headphones  give these a try   i have used this headphone for awhile now_and i really love it  it fits around my ears and glasses  maybe not completely perfect but the sound is amazing  i compared it to my older skull candy headphones and these ones are definitely better  i enjoy wearing these while chilling at home or talking a walk  like all headphones you ll have to_take them off after long uses because_it may hurt the top of your head ears  but i usually wear these for longer and i_ve been fine  i_love these headphones_not only is the_price right but     i_love these headphones_not only is the_price right but the_quality is amazing  i_love the_way these sound while i play my music how you came adjust the volume without touching your phone or tablet  i have been using these every chance i get and they go everywhere with me  my family tried them and they said it sounds the_same as their beats headphones and i agree  i would recommend these to anyone who wants a_great wireless headphones but not have to pay a_lot for a pair  only wish they came_with a hard case instead_of a bagged one but that wasn_t a big deal i just bought that along with these and of course got the protection plan cause you never know what may happen down the line   total for all that was 55   rounded to the nearest dollar  so_if you want some that look cool and sound great get these  exceeded expectations in every way  well done  for the_money    and even for more money    these over the ear headphones are spectacular  i am picky  but these are spectacular  why  1  they look more expensive than they are  they are sturdy  stylish  2  they are very comfortable  i have a big head  these fit just_fine  and are very comfortable  these are perhaps the most comfortable headphones i have ever owned  and i have owned dozens of them over the years  they do_not grip your head too tight  nor are they too loose  the padding on the earpeices is soft and plush  but not overdone or mushy  these are great to wear  3  they sound really good  many bluetooth headsets and earphone and heaphones at this price point have a whine or hum or static when no music is playing  these do_not    they are absolutely silent  the bass is deep and good  they are pretty clear sounding  not muddy  very very_good sound  you can pick out all_of the crummy audio on youtube  as compared to the cleaner audio from a service like spotify or itunes oor amazon music  which means that these can reproduce sound well enough for you to tell the difference  i_d say that the headphones have a pretty neutral sound  with plenty_of bass which does_not overwhelm and is_not too boomy  considering the_price range  you are never going_to_get  best ever  tight and accurate bass from bluetooth headphones in this price range  but the bass does_not offend  and as_i said  i am rather picky  but i_can apply a sliding scale based on price  there are plenty_of over bassed  boomy headphones  and plenty_of people who think that sounds good  ugh  with regular music  let s face it  you have bluetooth compression  so_it isn_t ever going_to be audiophile quality over bluetooth  but at home or going for a walk  i_love these things  they are so nice  i_do_not want_to_work out in them and ruin them or sweat them up  but i_ll bet theyy d be good_for working out if you do_not mind grody headphones  lol  they do_not feature active noise cancelling  but the ear cups block out most ambient noise  unless you are paying giant dollars  active noise cancellation merely kills battery life  adds noise and lower resolution sound  not necessary  a doodad most do_not need  and i_do_not miss it on these headphones  4  mechanics  they connected via bluetooth very easily  when you power them on  they connect relatively quickly  walking all around my entire 1200 sqft condo  i never lost the signal  even though the phone was on one side of the condo and i was on the_other  they charge via the ubiquitous micro usb found on android phones  though there is a warning not to charge these on anything more_than a 5w adapter  the controls are sparse and subtle    they are not visually obvious so as to ruin the aesthetics of the headphones    but the controls are easy_to find and use  one power pairing play pause button in the middle  up_and down volume and forward and back buttons  they work great  the charging port is subtly located  adding to the style and class of these very_well though out headphones  5  durability longevity  hey i just bought them  they seem to be of high quality but time will tell  i have 2 other mpow products and have owned them for more_than a year and they both still work fine  so mpow seems_to have their qc under control  you see things like this at this price point and you think  are they worth it   and  will it sound like garbage   herere to tell you  these are worth it  they sound great  and they are a_very worthwhile purchase  excellent headphones for low cost bluetooth solution  i_ve probably owned 25 different kinds of headphones over the years    from cheap  cheap to multiple hundred dollars in cost  expensive ones have broken  cheap ones have held up for a while  but i still ended up needing a pair of inexpensive  bluetooth headphones to_use when watching tv or listening to music while going_to sleep  these were cheap  about  35  but had good reviews so_i_decided to try them  what a surprise  decent sound quality  i_m older and my hearing isn_t what it used to be  but they have reasonably solid bass and the frequency response seems smooth to me   the sound quality isn_t what you ll get from really high grade headphones but the build quality is good_and it is  after all  being used with an iphone playing mp3s  and it is quite an upgrade from using earbuds  i_m pretty sure i could not have gotten a better value for the_money  they are solid and although i_ve only had for a_couple months  i think they re going_to hold up well over time  pairing is easy_and they don_t seem to require recharging too frequently  anyone who has  40 or  50 expectations should be very pleasantly surprised with both the sound and the build quality on these  sound is very clear  a_good stylish product  amazingly durable material i_m a_video blogger  and it s important for me to have a_good stylish product  these headphones are just a bomb  my favorite red sound is very clear amazingly durable material these headphones are perfect  it works amazingly well with my glasses and     these headphones are perfect  it works amazingly well with my glasses and plugs  stretched ear lobes   it does a_great job helping me block out all the_other people around me when i am at a coffee shop  best bang for the buck   get bangin      not going_to lie    i only bought these to hold me off till corsair makes a better version of the void with true surround sound but it turns out these headphones are freaking amazing   the_price  style  colors and comfort are all a grand slam  the battery on this_thing_is fantastic and it baby sips on the juice  if_i had to be critical of these and i_don_t want_to be but i_d have to_say the fact the headphones don_t twist forwards like all the rest of the traditional headphones  these do fold into a more smaller and portable size which is great but i_don_t know    i_m really stretching here guys  very_happy_with my purchase  thank you mpow  i_ll gladly buy another pair from you guys  update  i realized there is no pictures in the reviews for the blue headphones  maybe these might help    i_guess  very_nice headphones  these headphones are quite nice  they fit well_and operate as stated  i_purchased them to operate with my 55 series samsung tv  the 55 series will not sync directly to the headphones  the 64 series will  so_i_purchased a bluetooth adaptor which synced with the headphones easily  these headphones support two bluetooth devices allowing me to sync my iphone as a secondary device  i couldn_t be happier with the outcome and yes  i would recommend to friends and family  awesome headphones for under  40  highly_recommend  good sound  good quality  superb value  update  9 months in  i live in these   radheadphones      these are awesome for  35  they sound ok  they initially sounded a_little flat  but i_don_t really care about sound quality  these have nice 40mm drivers  they sound decent  people can hear me good when i_m on the phone  with no wind   they work very_well on my phone  and on my laptop i have a top  find your bluetooth driver on your computer  go to power management  and disable_to_setting  allow windows to turn off the device to save power   these headphones connect_to my computer almost immediatly after power on  same with the phone  they are comfy  keep my ears warm in seattle  they look nice  i highly highly_recommend them over a  300 pair of beats  buy these for your friends  like champ  100 i order this head phone for my video editing and they work real good  noise cancellation is real good  sound is real good via bluetooth  it has a strong bass  the design is solid and strong  battery is real good too  highly_recommend mpow  also_i have the cheetah sport and they work like champ  very comfortable also plus the_company will work_with you if you have any problems  satisfaction  100  very_nice  comfortable  and good sound  pros  i_love the fact that it s bluetooth and wired so you can use it with older systems too  battery lasts a solid 8 hours at work_with continuous play  over the ear fits nicely and is very comfortable  the headband isn_t snug or too tight like many are  sound is very_good over bluetooth from my phone  you can control the volume and answer calls via the buttons built_into the headphones  cons  i had a_bit of a hard time getting the bluetooth to connect but once paired they work very_well  there is no tactile feature on the buttons so_it s hard to feel if you are on the volume button or the on off button  it would be nice to have the buttons contoured in some manner to allow you to control without having to look  as a 20 year member of amazon i rely on independent reviews when shopping and i will always try to be as honest and impartial as_i_can and will try to provide helpful insight into the_product  i am reviewing this_product as_it relates to how it works for me in my intended use  i tend to review products that i really like  or that let me down in some manner  if you found this review helpful  then please click the  helpful  link below  thank you  and happy shopping  beautiful design  flawless operation in this day and time  it is refreshing to encounter a product that is_not all cast plastic  the construction of this headset is truly a work of art   not obvious in the listing photos is the stainless steel inner headband  and the whole thing_is put together with metal clasps and lovely machined screws  at least 12 visible   so  it is really a sensual joy to pick this up_and place it on your head  the construction almost feels like a finely jeweled watch   so surprising for a  30 product  the ear cups seem to be very solidly attached to the band  yet in a way that they articulate to conform to your head   and the ear pads just look like they are going_to hold up for a decent time period  granted  i_ve only had this baby for about 2 weeks  i_ve had bluetooth headsets in the past  and finally got away from them because_it seems like you are always battling with getting the damned thing to pair up  not so with this_unit   when i first connected to my tablet  of course i had to_go into my tablet bluetooth settings  but just one time  ever since  even when the headset auto powers down from extended idle time  i just put them on  open my tablet  press the multifunction pairing volume button on the headset  and  voila  beautiful sound  i_use this headset almost exclusively with a single tablet   i_m guessing pairing to multiple devices might add an additional degree of complexity to the process  but that s never an issue for me  my hearing isn_t what it used to be  so_i am used to cranking up the volume  but  man   these babies are loud   even my feeble ears can only tolerate about half volume  as far as sound quality  i won_t say these produce true high fidelity sound  but that s_not what i_bought them for   mostly watching movies and youtube  where the sound quality and bass response is without criticism  a bonus is the plug in cable that comes as an accessory  so_i suppose if you had a non bluetooth device just can just plug it right in and enjoy your sound  truly an astounding product for the_price  why pay more  great_buy  comfortable and good sound believe i finally found a_great set of headphones  at a_very_good_price  they look super nice  quality seem sturdy  well made   and the fit is extreamly comfortable  i have yet to try them out at the gym  and wear them for a longer period of_time   not to loose or tight  the sound is perfect_for my use  meaning great quality for the gym  for super music enthusiast  i would go with more expensive brand   it would be nice if the volume could go a_little higher  you will not get anything loud here  but the sound is good  paring with both my samsung s4 phone  and ipad 2 was very_easy  as was charging  walked 10meters away from my phone  and the music was still perfect  the sound is the_same quality  wheather bluetooth or direct cable connect  next i_need_to pair it with my lg tv  hopefully that will go as smooth as everything else  all_in all  i will recommend these headphones  they fold up easily  very comfortable and good sound  all for about  35 00  update  i have used the headphones at the gym  and they are truly comfortable  have had them on for 2 hours without a_problem  almost forgot i had them on  they do_not do noise cancellation  but the sound is good  and they look sharp  got compliments   still easy_to connect and charge     love my headphones  for the_price you absolutely cannot best these headphones for the_price you absolutely cannot best these headphones  i_ordered these for my wife to_use during a trip from dfw to seatac and nearly didn_t give them to her because_i_liked them so_much  pairing is quick and simple just press and hold the_power button and you are good to_go  sound quality will blow you away considering what you paid for these  i_ve bought many headphones in my life some very expensive and some very cheap  these sound like they should cost about  120 the bass isn_t amazing but that d alright with me  passive noise cancelation is_nothing like active noise cancelation  all these do is isolate you from the outside world and as such anything too high pitched or too low pitched will still make it through  but once the music is playing you won_t be able_to hear the outside world at_all  battery life has been outstanding so_far as_well i haven_t actually managed to fully kill them yet but they did last from the moment i_got through security st the airport to when i stepped into my ride at the_other side a_good 10 hours later  my only real problem is the fact that instead_of just a beep when at full volume it actually has a voice telling you that and it can be a_bit annoying  great quality headphones at an_excellent price  i had a_month of traveling and i_tried_to_use ear buds on the plane on my first trip  ear buds were almost completely useless and i started looking_for a set of noise cancelling earphones as soon as_i_got home  i_m happy to_say that these made my second trip much better  these aren t miracle earphones  i was still aware that i was on an airplane  but i was able_to listen to gentile meditation and relaxation music on the plane and i only heard a slight buzzing in the_background from the plane engines  when i took the headphones off the talk to the attendant  i was amazed how loud the plane cabin was outside these headphones  they cut out a_good 90  of the noise  they are comfortable enough for me  and the folding feature was handy  they easily fit into my purse while going through airport security  you ll need_to read the instructions to_get the hang of the controls  pretty much  you just hold down the_power button until it turns on and pairs  and hold it again to turn off  i_can_t speak to the phone features  i_m only interested in using these as traditional headphones  if you have an upcoming flight and are considering headphones  i_can highly_recommend these  if you want_to spend  200 for some super duper headphones then go for it  but if you want something sturdy  affordable  and of good quality then these are great  love these in office and lawncare setting  go ahead and buy two pair  maybe three  i have to share mine with my wife  these are awesome  i_bought these and a pair of mpow thor  these are much better  i wear them at work in my office job to drown out the distractions  as_well as my side job  my lawn care business  they work very_well to block out the loud engine noise and create a wonderful listening experience  i often listen to audiobook which are very_easy_to hear in a loud environment  these headphones have a rich and deep sound for music  as_good as beats  to me  a_very long battery cycle is nice  i charge mine maybe once a_week if even that  and that s listening for a_couple hours at work  then 2 4 in the evenings  they adjust well_and fit nicely  they don_t feel cheap  to be honest the thor model feels cheap and doesn_t compare  on these  the controls are very_nice_and easy_to_use  the range is astonishing  i walk to the printer and forget to_take my phone  no loss at_all with many people and computers smartphones devices between  mowing  i_ve left my phone on the mower and walked all the_way around the house without loss or even a skip  sorry for the length  but i want_to_make sure i cover it all  i have not a single complaint in several months of hard use  buy them  buy these over the thor  sorry mpow to bash the thor but these are far superior  ordering a_few more pairs soon  one to keep at work so_i_don_t have to carry in and out  one for wife  one for uncle  thanks mpow for a_great_product  excellent sound for the_price i have to listen to music while i_m cutting the grass and my old bt headphones we re wearing out and just didn_t cut it when sitting on my new mower  ztr with the engine right behind the seat   i_didn_t want_to wear my  300  noise cancelling bose headphones for mowing the lawn  i just wanted a cheap set that would deliver the tunes and block out the engine noise and these fit the bill perfectly  i_don_t have to have them turned up all the_way to hear the music and they sound surprisingly good  not quite bose quality but also not a  300 difference    they fit my head well_and are comfortable throughout my 2 hour lawn mowing time  i_can_t comment on the phone related features because_i haven_t made or accepted any calls while wearing them  but  i_can say that the pair to my iphone 6 easily every time_and the music related controls work as you d expect  fantastic for the_price i was definitely skeptical before i_bought these  and i_did a_lot of research on wireless bluetooth headphones before i pulled the trigger  after reading a_lot of reviews for other items  i came to the realization that most of the reviews were fake  this is_not a fake review  i_bought these so that i could easily listen to music while in the office  and i was getting sick of using the ear buds provided with my phone  i actually purchased another pair of headphones thinking that these mpow ones would be too cheap sounding for this price  i was wrong  the_ones i_bought sounded absolutely terrible and muddy  while these actually have a_nice clean sound  the bass isn_t overwhelming  but it is still definitely there  which i learned is a_good thing for these headphones  pros    great_value for price   very comfortable   easily paired   clean sound that still has bass cons    there aren t any tactile bumps on the controls  so you honestly have no idea which one you re pressing so_far i am very_happy_with my decision to_return the_other headphones and get these ones instead  i_love mine but i_ll keep ya updated on how long they last  which might be a while they look and feel durable  mpow is quickly becoming my go to heat set for everything sound related  my first headset from them was just tiny wireless bluetooth earbuds and i_love them  i_bought them about 2 years ago and they are still going strong and the battery still lasts forever which is incredible  since_i_needed a_new headset for my computer_instead_of my phone yet again i_decided instead_of the usual which is usually turtle beach and lasts about a year i would check out mpow s offering  this is the headset i_decided to_get and i_m not disappointed with my first impressions  comfortable  acceptable sound quality and they feel sturdy  they can be wired or wireless which is a huge plus for me since 50  of the_time the wire breaking down on turtle beach is the_problem and then the_other is turtle beach just falls apart because_it s cheap plastic  this has metal in obvious strategic locations so_i have a_good feeling these are going_to last awhile hopefully and if they break  metal is much easier to fix than cheap plastic  overall perfect fit and i have a relatively big head so size matters here  i think they hit the perfect dimensions to accommodate our different sized cue balls so_if mpow keeps up the great work i_doubt i_ll buy anything other_than mpow for as long as they keep pushing out great headphones  cons   a_very slightly heavy but you don_t notice it after you put them on and think awwwwww yyeeeeaaaahhh thems some comfortable ear cups  honestly  it s_not a big deal and just now_i took them off and gave them a_few bounces in my hand and they didn_t seem heavy but my initial impression was they were a_bit weighty so_i_m sticking in on here anyway  sound quality could be better but honestly  they sound epic enough_to satisfy me so could be improved but overall what a fantastic headset  great job mpow love the name love their headsets more  on a side note if you get these head over to youtube a google  falcon heavy sounds  you won_t be disappointed   if you like rockets  sonic booms  and tesla roadsters in space  unbeatable sound  comfort  and ease of use for the_price  best headphone deal on_amazon  lets cut to the chase  q  how do they sound  a  excellent  in truth  they have very little character of their own  which is a_good thing  a_very_good thing  the bass is_not as extended as some much more expensive phones  but what s there is clean_and not boomy as some have reported  what really impresses me is their ability to portray depth  which isn_t easy for a sealed design  there is no upper midrange  clarity bump   zippy highs or serious resonances  they compare very_well with my much more expensive wireless sennheisers in fact  i_bought these for hearing protection while mowing the lawn  but their comfort  great sound and ease of use makes me think i_ll be using them for indoor use  commuting and dogwalking as_well  in short  these cans are a superb deal  i have already recommended them to a_few friends and will be buying more as christmas presents  i_love these cans  tight  but fixable overall  great_value  sound is very impressive with these for the_price_and it s great to control the music with headphone buttons  mic is ok but not good enough imo to_use for work  it sounds good on my end  but the people on the_other end will not likely enjoy it for very long  headphones too tight  fix them by using a hair dryer on the plastic and bending them out carefully  or to be more cautious  by using a torx size t7 bit to_take the clips off  and bending the metal  and also applying heat to carefully bend the plastic  be careful  the screws are small    and if you brake the plastic  you did it wrong      after a_month  no_complaints for the_price  these are great  after over a_week of around 1 5 hrs a day of gym run time at near max volume  the headphones still hold a_little over half of their charge  pairing was a breeze  all buttons work just_fine  and sound is pretty clear  bass is great  treble is a_little too sharp for rock metal but that can be remedied through on a music player app  will update in a_couple months  update 1  a_month later  i just experienced my first low battery beeps after over a_month of the initial charge  i_cant really compare to higher end dre beats or bose  but the battery longevity for the_price is outstanding  great_for hard of hearing we have a unique situation where my brother  who has down syndrome is very hard of hearing  and refuses to wear his hearing aid  he is also autistic  and spends a_great_deal of_time_in his room watching one game show after another  i_doubt he could hear much  and i_m certain he missed out on half if not all the voices  sooooo   i found these headphones on_amazon  and they had a_great rating  bought a blue tooth thingy to connect them to the tv  i saw my brother smile for the_first time_in forever  he was able  even with his hearing loss  to hear the tv  even if he goes down the hall to another room  the voice from the tv carries  i would have spent 1000  for these headphones that have made such a difference in the_quality of his life  they are so comfortable  the clarity is outstanding  the range is waaaaay more_than_i would have thought possible  i would recommend these for anyone hearing impaired  the difference between silence and being able_to interact with sounds from tv  or radio would make a huge difference for the hearing impaired  so_far_so_good  ok so_i_bought the patterned fx victoria for  27 and then yesterday i_got these mpow for  37  as you can see the mpow are a_little larger and cover the entire adult ear  the sound is better on the mpow  because_it covers entire ear  and the material feels sturdier  now the fx victoria i_ve had for months and they work great_and have no regrets  i_ll use the mpow some more and update later if necessary  but for adults i_d get the mpow and for kids the fx victoria  these headphones are good   these headphones are good     but sadly the pair i_purchased lost blue tooth function after two weeks  15 days   since_i_used these solely for gym work it made them worthless to me  i attempted to contact the manufacturer for replacement or repair but the website  contact  button didn_t_work  based on those facts i have to complain about these phones  but i will say that prior to the bluetooth failure i was happy_with the_product  just that without it these are just another wired pair of headphones and now_i have to_buy a_new set  not mpow   mpow if you are reading this i would still love to hear from you so we can get these fixed  update       and mpow sent me another_one that works just perfect  its comfortable  which is important since_i_use them for gym work  and the new_one has been going strong for over a_month already  i want_to thank mpow for this since_it makes me a loyal customer in the future when you stand behind your product this well  i_m absolutely satisfied_with these headphones i_m absolutely satisfied_with these headphones  especially wireless for such a low price point  sound quality is much better_than my last similarly priced wired headphones  i_m not an expert in sound quality but personally i_don_t find flaws at_all  microphone_is amazing  i_m not_even sure where it s located  but sound quality is great over skype  so_it s really 10 10 considering the_price point  there s two minor issues  that hardly worth mentioning    there s an option to connect_to 2 devices simultaneously but it s_not_working well if you listening to music on your phone and browsing internet on your connected desktop at the_same time  in other words if you listen to one device with another_one occasionally activating   well sound quality will noticeably drop when both devices playing sounds    if you don_t listen to constant stream of sounds for a while they have activation delay maybe half a second or so  it s a_very specific issue that not everyone will notice  gamers  music listeners  movie watchers won_t notice it  but if you doing exercises at khan academy  that  completed  sound will play with delay each time  unless you listen to some music also  but like i said these issues are minor and hardly worth mentioning  almost perfect  and fabulous for the_price very_nice headphones  they fit my average sized head very_well  they feel snug  almost like they could be too snug  but they remain comfortable for several hours  the look and build quality are nice  it s all plastic except for a_few key parts  but they have a sturdy feel and i find them fairly stylish  controls are intuitive  with a typical 4 way circular rocker with a center button  up_and down for volume and right and left for track is easy_to remember  i almost took off one_star for sound quality  but decided i was being too harsh  compared to a  300 pair of headphones  they are a_bit lacking  with a sound that is_not as crisp and punchy as_i would like  but compared to most under  50 headphones  they are outstanding  the bass is sufficient and never overbearing and the mids and highs are pretty well balanced and open sounding  just not as 100  fresh as_i would wish for  that said  i think they sound better_than a  120 pair of sony bluetooth phones i_tried recently and returned  overall  these are a_great_value and a_very satisfactory product  amazing sound  cheap price_and a snug fit  with a pretty decent build  i was looking_for some over ear headphones that i could use to_work out with  i chose these because of the reviews and pricing  i chose over ear primarily because_i_wanted wireless  and headphones that weren t going_to constantly fall out my ears  these head phones come in a plane packaging  with an aux cable and soft carrying bag for the headphones  the headphones fit pretty snug which is nice because when i_went running they were falling off or sliding back  they held up perfecting fine  the sound quality was really good  i_expected some pretty bad lows or even bad highs but the headphones have a_great balance  pairing it by bluetooth to my cell phone was pretty easy  if you can follow directions   the build quality is ok  the gloss black seems like it would scratch easily  i_use this for both running and lifting weights  and it hasnt had any issues_with falling off at_all  great headphones for the_price dont hesitate  click add to cart  you wont be disappointed  great headphones  quite honestly didnt believe theyd be for the low price  i_bought them for my 10yo son  he uses them mostly for his tv and they hook up easily to his apple tv and then when he chooses they seemlessly hook to his phone  he says they even pause play his apple tv as_well as control it as_well  my sons says he feels as_if hes in the shows lol  without a doubt this is a_great_buy  great comfort for the value great set of headphones for the_cost  very comfortable  cool looking  and easy_to_use  a single charge seems_to last about 12 hours of continuous use   but since_i_don_t use mine continuously  i_can get about a_week of intermittent use out_of them  you need_to_install the headphone drivers  and make sure your device is bluetooth enabled  my computer didn_t have bluetooth  so_i_purchased a_usb 4 0 bluetooth transmitter  there s a moment where the headset syncs with the_computer  then you get sound through the headphones  if you re going from wired to wireless sound  the audio quality is really good   there s some very minor static or feedback  very minor  so_i noticed it wasn_t the_same as wired quality  but nothing that really bothered me for long  overall  i really like this_as a replacement for my wired headset   no cords is a huge improvement  the cord kept getting caught on my arm or chair  and moving my chair the rollers would often roll over the wire    which was bad  all_of that worry is gone now  awesome upgrade  re review   new headphones i_purchased the mpow 059 headset and originally submitted a 2 star review based mainly on the low volume issues  however  i am submitting a_new review and changing it to a 5 star rating based mostly on their customer_service  when they saw my rating they offered to send me a different set of headphones and when i accepted  they sent me the mpow h2 headphones  now  these new headphones have a_very slightly higher volume and they are on ear instead_of over ear  but the sound quality is better   more crisp  like i said above  this is a_little tricky since this 5 star rating is based primarily on their customer_service and their desire to resolve the issue and not on the_quality of their product  i_guess you get what you pay_for and this is one_of the pitfalls of buying on line and not actually testing the_products in person  i applaud mpow for trying_to_make this right  
great sound for budget headphones i_ve really enjoyed these mpow bluetooth headphones  especially for the_price  at an entry level price  you get good sound and long battery life  it doesn_t have the really deep bass like some other headphones do  but they offer decent balanced sound  if you wear them for more_than an hour  it could start to hurt your ears if you have larger ears  if you use the bluetooth feature  make sure you either turn your headphones or phone volume all the_way up to maximize your volume  with one turned all the_way up then you can control the volume with the_other device  they pair really fast with an iphone 6s plus and they have audio cues to let you know what mode the headphones are in  making a call was clear  but having my voice muffled by the over the ear style headphones isn_t ideal for me  so_i probably wouldn_t use them for long calls  while they don_t have active noise cancellation  they do a_good job at keeping background noise out because of the style  great pair of bluetooth headphones for the_price as a certified audio professional who mainly listens to and composes rock music  i_can say that at this price point you are not going_to_get sennheiser  bose or beats audio quality out_of the_box  however  for the_price these are useable headphones that are more_than capable of providing decent audio quality  once the right adjustments are made   they require a_bit of frequency gain reduction between 60 250hz to reduce boom and a boost at around 16khz to establish clarity  once youve done that youll have a more balanced sound from these headphones  the bluetooth volume controls  and battery status bar indicators of these headphones are natively supported on android  but not on macos   in other words when you adjust the volume on your headphones it will directly adjust the volume control on your android device  on the mac the headphones volume is independent of macos  play pause and skip buttons work natively on both platforms  there are no latency issues when watching video  lips move in sync with audio  the mpow 059 supports the sbc audio codec exclusively  which means no aac or aptx is present  it would have been great to_see support for aac seeing as_it is a superior codec to sbc but nonetheless sound quality is reasonable  macos users will need_to_download the_hardware io tools for xcode from apples developer page in order to_get the bluetooth explorer application  this application will allow you to increase the bitpool value from its default value of 40 to 53  this will dramatically improve the audio quality of these headphones and any other bluetooth headphones that rely solely on the sbc codec  for those who want specifics  a_bit pool value of 53 is equal to a_bitrate of 325 kbps  sbc at 325 kbps is the equivalent of mp3 at 256 kbps  when the youve downloaded hardware io tools for xcode and have opened the bluetooth explorer app you will see the apps name in your menubar  go to tools   audio options or command   shift   a  this will bring up the window for you to edit the sbc audio settings  under sbc codec options set all bitpool values to 53 and close the window  this will ensure that the audio quality remains optimal  close the window and re connect your bluetooth headphones  build quality seems reasonable  hinges are reinforced with metal  only time will demonstrate the endurance of these headphones but superficially speaking the headphones appear to be quite sturdy  the ear cups and headband are made of a soft synthetic leather which provides initial comfort but they are a_bit shallow in depth and can place a_bit of pressure on the ears when the headset is worn for an extended period of_time  battery life is reasonable  accessories include a micro usb cable for charging and a 3 5 mm audio cable which is handy for more critical listening and for events in which the battery has lost its charge  the velvet like pouch is a_great inclusion and provides protection against dust and scratches  these headphones are definitely worth the_price_and i_doubt youll find better at this price point  great quality for the_price really great headphones for the_price  i had a pair of  60 headphones   i honestly prefer these  they were specifically bass heavy headphones but ended up being muffly sounding so_i_bought these instead   i_can honestly say that the mpow headphones are better overall  they are very crisp and clear but they do_not have heavy bass at_all  i listen to a_lot of bass heavy dubstep   these headphones do_not have strong bass in my opinion whatsoever  but on a plus_note  as_i said  the sound is very crisp   clear   the volume does get decently loud  if your phone device is at full volume the headphones can still go louder which is great  kind of wish it had a hard case instead_of the sack but thats_not really a big deal  super comfortable on your head  super soft pads  also  these headphones are super simple to operate   connect_to devices  i would recommend these for sure  pretty decent for commuting  for what they cost  these do a pretty_good job  the sound quality is fine but not great  these are by no stretch of the imagination bose headphones    and they occasionally cut out for a moment here and there when on bluetooth mode  i_use them for commuting on public transportation  and it s really nice not to have to deal with tangling cords with my bag  etc   i also use them occasionally at my desk at work  and was worried about sound carrying over as some folks have mentioned  but i asked my officemates and no one could hear anything  i think as long as the cup is well fitted around your ear  no sound should come out  they re definitely large and in charge  but i prefer over ear to on ear  so that s what you get  they ve held a charge amazingly well so_far  i_ve used them off and on for over a_month now_and haven_t yet had to charge them after their initial charge  the buttons are a_little cheap feeling  and the voice confirmation of settings  power on  power off  etc   drive me nuts  but overall they re decent enough and do the job  superior quality these headphones are actually a_little bit better_than_i_thought when i_decided to_buy a pair  i_wanted better quality in terms of hearing audio  but i_m not exactly someone who listens to music with devices all the_time  this seemed to be the_best choice  and i_do think it s worth it  in terms of audio  it does sound crisp and clear   but at the_same time can rock out if you want_to hear it full volume  the_only real problem is one_of the good features that it has  if you like to wear headphones for a long period of_time_it will feel slightly uncomfortable over the ears  but that gives superior sound  almost to the point where you could tune out others around you  great headphones  just a_little tight on my ears overall impression  these are great headphones for the_price but  perhaps due to the size of my head  i_can_t wear them for long sound quality  i_m really impressed with these headphones considering the_price range they re in  the sound is crystal clear and they re great at minimizing sound intrusion  my neighbors were doing some serious construction the_other day and i couldn_t hear them with these headphones on  these don_t provide a massive bass experience but what you ll hear is the_best i_ve experienced for headphones under  100 fit  for starters  i_m 6 2  and always have a hard time finding head related gear  think sunglasses  hats  that fits properly  i_don_t know why head stuff is so challenging for me  maybe i_m an alien  but these are too tight on my head  the padding  both on the ears and on the top of the head  is great but i_can still only stand wearing them for 15 20 minutes at a time before my ears can_t take the pressure anymore  bonus  i_didn_t realize from the picture but these fold down to a compact size really nicely  they ll make for great travel headphones  good sound  but need some breaking in  nice headphones with good sound  but had to adjust them slightly to fit comfortably  when i first got them  they clamped too tightly on my head  which would be great_for exercising  but i wear them for hours at a desk   to stretch them out  i put them around a box for a_couple nights  the amazon box they came_in  and now they fit comfortably  i also noticed they are more comfortable for my head if_i wear them backward  controls on the left side  so the ear pads don_t rest on my jaw  they are heavier than headphones without bluetooth  so my head will tire faster  but that comes_with the territory   for reference  my head is about average for an adult female  my only other complaint is the buttons are a_little loud when i click them while wearing the headphones  but not unbearable  all around happy_with this_purchase after breaking them in a_bit  really wanted to like this_product i really  really wanted to like this_product  but sadly i_cannot  bought it as a present for my mom and was super excited  they re really pretty and she really likes pink  so perfect gift right  wrong  when i opened the_box  it looked good  it came_with all the parts    and then i_went to charge it  i actually bought another pair before this  but in blue as they didn_t have the pink headphones at the_time  and like the_other ones    that i returned because_it wouldn_t charge  this wouldn_t either  i first thought that  oh yes  it s charging  the lights came on  and then when i_went to check on it a_few minutes later  the lights were off and i_thought  oh wow  that certainly charged quickly  tried_to turn it on  turned on for a second  and it powered on  then it immediately powered off  thinking that it was possibly user error  i_tried again  same thing  so naturally i_went to charge it again  this time using a different usb port  and then when that didn_t_work  used a wall charger  the lights went on  and few minutes later  the lights went out again  it wasn_t charging  so_i contacted the_company  they were courteous  and they told me to try again  using different charging methods  which i already did    and then they told me to_return it  they also said that they were willing to pay up to  6 in shipping and handling  quite generous of them i_thought  but then i found out that it was going_to cost me significantly more to ship it back  i ended up returning it to amazon  as that s free  and i really don_t want_to_do anything with them anymore  very_disappointed  really wanted to like it  but     well  and that s the end of my rant  edit  04 08 2018 due to excellent customer_service  i_received a_new pair of headphones  and lo and behold  they work  for the_price  the sound is pretty decent  they re comfortable  and my mom loves them  great when connected via 3 5mm audio cable  not so great sound with bluetooth i just returned some very overpriced  very defective sony cans  and i_m happy to_say that these far less expensive mpow headphones have them beat in just about every way so_far  they re still new  but they re comfy  they fold up for easy storage while still being adjustable in size  come_with a_nice bag to sleeve them in  and   most importantly   they sound great     if you re connecting via the included 3 5mm headphone jack  the_one place they fall short is in the_same area a_lot of bluetooth headphones do  music sounds like garbage when dealing with bluetooth audio compression  and unfortunately  they don_t appear to have any tricks on hand to offset this issue  the net result is that music sounds thin and hollow when playing over wireless  the difference is huge between bluetooth vs  3 5mm connections  all_in all  very_happy_with the_purchase  just wish they had more  oomph  when playing over bluetooth  i_ll keep them plugged in instead  nice  edit  after my original review  i was sent another set of headphones  i set them up for my dad today and we both tried them  theyre pretty solid  they fit over the ear as opposed to on top of it  and that makes them much more comfortable_to wear for longer periods of_time  nice noise cancellation is great  nice colors too  weve been testing them almost all day  and the battery is still pretty full  im glad we tried the replacement  he really likes them  the right speaker didnt work_and the left speaker sounded like i was a bat trying_to_use echolocation  i_bought these as a christmas gift for my dad  and was sure he was just setting it up wrong  nope  now_i have to_return them and think of something else  stopped pairing with transmitters   had them less_than a_month   update in review    update below   these headphones are testing my patience  let me start with the good then i_ll talk about the bad  pros  they re pretty comfortable  they weren t that expensive  they look nice_and feel sturdy  cons  they stop pairing with my bluetooth transmitters  i have 2 different brands of transmitters and for some reason these headphones will pair with one  work for a_few hours then boom  it won_t pair again  i_ve tried making sure both headphones and transmitters were fully charged but it s a no go  the headphones like one night stands with my transmitters  it will work once or twice then never again  i_can_t tell you how many times i_ve tried pairing these with the two transmitters i have and it just doesn_t_work  then eventually  i_can_t_even get the headphones to pair at_all  it goes from power on to power off  completely useless if_i_can_t use the wireless option of these headphones  i_m very_disappointed  update  the_company sent me a replacement and it s been working_great  i_m able_to pair it with no_issues  the_first pair has again began pairing with my computer s blue tooth but still won_t pair with my bluetooth transmitters but that s okay since the new pair works_fine  very_nice product  so_far very_good  i connect this headset unit using the bluetooth capability to a trond bt duo wireless transmitter   receiver  both sold here on_amazon for a reasonable price but not as a package deal   individually   the trond bt transmitter is connected to my vizio 32  smart hd tv through the tv s rca audio out connections  the audio is superb through this headset  there s no latency or hesitation in lip sync transmissions  something_i_cannot stand to_see hear  i_tried several other transmitter headset combinations purchased at walmart but they all had either latency problems and or there was background static frying sound in the headset  there s no background noises in this tv application  the headset is very comfortable_to wear and is quite appealing to the eye  big grin   i recommend this combination to anyone else who is planning to_add bt to their tv  amazing cans for the_price battery life  a  comfort  a  sound quality  b pairing process  a  durability  a  connectivity a  batterylife  holy smokes  this_thing will go and go like your typical energizer bunny  comfort  i_ve never found myself wanting to_take these off simply because they hurt my ears or head  very comfortable  sound quality  this is where you get what you pay_for  they re your standard cheap can s sound quality  they don_t touch etymotic  shure  or klipsh  but they re not awful  i_can admire music from nearly every speaker i hear it out_of  the average person won_t have an issue with the sql  pairing process  i_know this is important to a_lot of you  the pairing process was very_easy with my iphone x  and my macbook pro 15   late 2016   the caveat here  is how mpow allows two connected devices at the_same time  there have been times i_ve turned these on 50 feet away from my computer  expecting them to pair to my phone  only to have forgotten they were last connected to my computer  wouldn_t you know  these headphones connected to the_computer  they stuttered a_bit  50 feet was also through concrete walls      but the connectivity distance is surprising on these  make sure you only keep one thing paired to them at a time though  durability  i list durability because_i work in the construction industry  so everything_is subject to destruction  these headphones have held up to the tough environment i thrust them through  connectivity  i already elaborated on the 50 feet range  surprisingly strong connectivity  awesome price_for everything_i_need  terrific price_for a_very comfortable set of solid headphones  the foam pads stay on my bald head while i_m at the gym  the sound is full from all sources  both corded and wireless  honestly  i_ve yet to have a need_to turn them all the_way up  the battery life is better_than_expected  as_well  i_can go a_couple days with then connected to my phone or ipad without a low battery warning  only two things made me deduct from the five star rating  and they re both easy fixes  1  the 3 5mm cord that was provided with the_unit is only 3 feet long  max  get a_new cord if you need these to be wired  2  if connected to two devices simultaneously  you may hear static if one device is playing but the_other makes a sound  solution  connect only to the device you d like to_use  if_i could give 4 5  i_d definitely do so  great  they stay put  sound isn_t the_best  and it isn_t noise cancelling  but i think these are worth the buy  they are wonderful so_far  terrible audio stuttering  constantly have to restart the headphones fit and finish of the headphones is decent  and the sound quality is decent  but wow  these headphones have some of the worst audio stuttering i_ve ever encountered in a bluetooth headphone  broken  stuttering audio if you pause your media for over 3 minutes  forcing you to power cycle the headphones to re establish a solid connection  happens consistently  regardless of the battery level  can_t recommend with the frequency of stuttering that occurs  update  the merchant reached out after seeing this review and sent a replacement headset  the new headset functions much better  good set of headphones  update 3 8 18 for my initial review  i_ve rated these headphones 2 5  but now_i_m updating my review and rating to 4 5 and heres why  i was contacted by patozon company and they were concerned about my issues and wanted to_make it a better experience for me  they sent over the new headphone replacement without extra cost  they arrived quickly then anticipated  right_out the_box the replacements looked a_lot better then the_first pair  the build quality was nice_and the hinges seemed to be better then the_first pair  as for the fit  i wear glasses all the_time  but i was still able_to_get a_nice seal around the ears and block the noises around me  as for the sound quality  they still struggle just a_bit  but with my iphone  i_m able_to change the settings for the music and get something more desirable  another great feature i_like  is the battery status  on the iphone  it displays how much charge is left on the headset  not every headphones offer that feature  overall this was a better headset then i_thought  i also have to commend patozon for their great customer_service  they were patient and helpful and solved my issues swiftly  thank you  old review  they are a mediocre pair of headphones  they do the simple job of playing music  the build quality is rather decent  but just like every other headphones  the area that should concern is the hinges  not_sure how they ll hold during time  for the_price you get something just ok  just don_t expect those high end features here  i_m happy so_far    so_far they work pretty well_and they are decently comfortable  there was a_few instances  3     times  on the_first night i_used them that the sound of the tv show i was watching went to full static  painful    i paused the tv show and started it again and the static was gone  it only happened that night and i have used them maybe 4 or 5 more times since then  maybe it was_interference from something nearby  i_don_t know   but so_far  there has_not been a repeat  this is my first ever pair of bluetooth headphones and probably only my second pair of over the ear headphones so_i_can_t really compare the_quality to anything else  i will say that the_seller patozon seems_to want_to provide good customer_service   they have already emailed me twice asking if all is ok and providing some tips  i believe i also saw them reply to some reviews to assist people who have issues  would i buy another pair of mpow headphones and would i buy_again from patozon   as_of right now  yes  if the headphones turn out to be lemons and blow out my eardrums or something  i will definitely update this review  review edited  read update  read some good review so_i_got myself a pair since_i_like wireless things best  the sound im disapointed with  it sounds muffled  i listened to some music with these and then compared it to just my standard apple headphones that come_with iphone  the difference was_immediately noticeable  it is muffled  the sound is quieter  and overal just does_not sound good  the mic is also not good according to my fiance  he only tends to complain about the_quality of the call when i_use these  compared to my old apple earbuds  i wouldnt know since_i_cant hear myself but since he complains even when i_dont tell him im using them i assume it is infact the headphones  the headphones also tend to tell me they are at max volume but then i look at my device and i_can clearly see there is much more volume to_go  very disappointing  will not order again  update 3 15 i_received a_new pair of headphones from the_company an no charge since_i was_not really satisfied as mentioned above  and personally i still dont like them but my fiance and his friend really like them  im probably just picky with headphones  and that is_not really the headphones fault so_i_went ahead and changed my review from 2 stars  at least my fiance now has some nice headphones for him to_use that he really likes  pretty_good overall theyre about what you should expect for the_price  standard over the ear head phones  nothing amazing sound quality wise  but fairly quality materials and acceptable recreational sound quality  if youre getting these for the bluetooth functionality specifically  look elsewhere as the bluetooth function leaves much to be desired  i was lucky enough_to_get them paired and working with a_usb dongle with my pc_for about 5 minutes  upon restart of the_computer they werent recognized again  trying_to_use them connected to my iphone and ipad were much easier  but the connection dropped frequently  i finally gave up after several hours of troubleshooting and researching and resolved to the 1 8 by 1 8 aux cord option  if they last a_couple months in this state  id say they were worth  40  usb dongle not included     also the_driver the dongle came_with was on a mini blue ray disk  and the instructions if you didnt have access to a capable drive  use a_computer_with a blueray disc reader and copy using a flash drive  oh thanks guys  well thought out suggestion there  how about a download link  you really selling that many headphones you couldnt afford the server dues for all the traffic  give me a break  mic stopped working after 4 update  i_received a replacement from the sender  that was very_nice of them  this_unit s microphone does work much better  so_it appears as_if the_hardware  mic  was defective  we will see what happens in the next few months if the mic fails again  otherwise  i am glad they are reading and acknowledging the comments and ratings  i_used this at work so_i_can_teleconference  not_even four months and the microphone died  not worth it  really surprised   i just got these  i charged them up  took about 3 hours for the initial charge  paired to my galaxy 8 really easy  the sound isn_t 100  amazing but its 95  good  it cancels out a_lot of noise  it fits snug around my ears and my head without being so tight to give me a headache  i tested them out doing laundry  i live in about a 900 sq ft apartment  went all over the apartment with my phone being in my room and didnt lose connection  i_cant wait to try these at the gym  i_do_notice however a slight buzzing but i_got use to it after an hour and didnt notice it with any other songs  they are very light weight as_well  i_may purchase another pair for my husband  
lag when using these to watch shows  average sound amazon reviews used to be helpful  i_m learning to start tempering them with a_good dose of skepticism  apparently terms like  fantastic    amazing   and  phenomenal  are used loosely and to cover a wide range of very average products  first off  for the_money these are decent headphones  they aren t anywhere close to better headphones in sound quality or build quality  but they aren t close to the_price either  my first and main issue with them is that there is_noticeable lag between the show and the sound through these headphones  any lag in sound while watching a show makes them unusable in my opinion  for music  not a big deal at_all_of course  second  the sound through these headphones is very average  there is no deep bass  i_ve used much smaller headphones  not over ear  and not earbuds  that have much better low range  i have a pair of over ear headphones i_purchased on_amazon for under  100 that have fantastic  truly fantastic  not fantastic for  35  sound  clarity  and low range  there is some noticeable fuzz static while listening to shows  though not enough that it really bothers me  let s stop giving 5 star  better_than my bose  not a fanboy   glowing reviews to average products  it doesn_t help anyone who needs honest opinions about products  lastly  mine only came_with an audio cable and a_usb cable  it did_not include a power adapter  which it sounded like it should from the manual when it tells me to insert the charger into a standard outlet  for  35  this is an ok set of headphones  i wouldn_t buy them again if the lag issue during shows is normal  decent i_ve had them for a_week now_and have used them just about everyday  i think i_ve got a_good handle on them  these headphones aren t the worst i_ve ever used but they definitely aren t the_best  i_ve got a pretty big head and they are able_to be adjusted to fit my big dome quite comfortably  they feel like they re decently made  some headphones that are this style feel like they ll break in half when you put them over your head  luckily these don_t feel that flimsy   but i still don_t want_to toss them around too much  i wear them in 2 situations  1 in which they perform exceptionally and another where they leave some to be desired  situation 1   around the house after work when i listen to podcasts  the perform very_well  the voice of the podcasters are clear and rich  the ability to leave my phone stationary charging up_and still use headphones is clutch  situation 2   at the gym  listening to music  the bass boost in these headphones is too much for my musical interests   mostly metal music  the low end of these headphones tends to muddy the guitars and midrange sounds  if you listen to edm or something similar they tend to sound better with this style of music  if you listen to heavy metal  i_d pass on these  my last complaint is that these headphones keep my head hot while i_m at the gym because the ear coverings are so large  i_ll get so hot that i_ll have to_take them off and wipe off my disgustingly sweaty head  so there s that  what else is included  there s a carrying bag that s made from a similar material as the crown royal bags  if you re familiar with those  there s a micro usb cable and a 3 5mm audio cable  both about 4 feet long  i included a dollar in my pictures for scale    update   after my review i was contacted by customer support regarding my displeasure with the headphones  they offered 3 potential solutions  1  send a different set of the_same model  2  a similar model they suggested  3  or offered to send me a model of my choosing  i_know some people like these poofy headphones but they ve never impressed me so_i_went with option 3 and chose the mpow cheetah headphones and have been really impressed with them  i_d give them a solid 7 10 on audio quality  there are certainly limitations regarding audio quality when it comes to ear bud style headphones but these definitely play heavy metal in an extremely satisfactory way  not too bassy  pretty clear highs and mids  i_like that i_m able_to turn the volume up beyond what my phone suggests because c mon  there s a reason i_can_t hear in the_first place  listening to my headphones too loud    cantstopwontstop   the buttons feel solid and have already taken quite a_bit of use  because_i_m always skipping songs  i think everybody does though  so_i_m good there  the_only_thing that s a_little counterintuitive  at least to me  regarding the buttons is that to change to the next song you have to click the volume down button  that just takes some getting used to but is hardly a negative  like most ear buds  after extended use they start to cause some discomfort in the ear  but that s_not a negative as much as_it s an indication to rejoin the rest of the world  if anything_it s a feature  overall i_ve been very impressed with the mpow cheetahs  i_d give them 5 5  i stopped using the original headphones entirely  actually  the battery lasts a_couple_of days before needing to be recharged  though  to be honest i_ll usually proactively charge it after 3 or 4 days  it s been a while since_i_got these so_i_can_t remember if_it came_with a micro usb cable or not  i_don_t seem to have an extra anywhere though  honestly i_m glad  i_ve got so many already i_m glad i_don_t have another  but it is a micro usb slot  tl dr anyway  to wrap this up  i_do_not recommend the mpow poofy over ear headphones initially reviewed  i highly_recommend the mpow cheetahs  though  5 5  used at the gym this headphone_is plastic construction  it does fit an adult female with small ears rather snuggly and securely  it is_not adjustable  due to plastic construction  this headset should be handled carefully as trying_to over extend will most likely cause cracking or worse  the interior padding on top of head makes it quite comfortable but by no means do i think it will prevent it from breakage if forced  the ear pads are comfortable  the bluetooth easily linked to my iphone 6p  it took a_bit to connect_to an ipod nano  but once connected it now easily pairs  at local gym  it does connect_to the bluetooth equipment but it can_take some doing each time to pair  the range is decent  30 40 feet  but once out_of range  it disconnects and must be paired again  in terms of sound  using it for standard tv on gym equipment the sound is fair  using it with my apple device music the sound is good  it can feel and sound like being in a vacuum which probably is due to the headset being tight on the head ears  the max volume is_not very loud  when pairing to phone  ipod and television each device itself must be set on the loudest setting  on gym equipment  the volume is very low even with equipment at max volume and headset at max volume  the volume control doesn_t really seem to_work  i also own a bose headset and the sound quality of bose is amazing  mpow is_not amazing  not_even close  again  this was purchased under  30 for the sole intention of being a headset to_use at the gym  it doesn_t flop on head  is secure and serves the purpose it was_intended for  i would not recommend this for anyone that wants a headset to listen to music or surround sound television  looks amazing  sounds meh  so  i_ve had these for almost two months now  and figured i had to let others know what the real deal is  pros    style  these look amazing  seriously  i get compliments almost every day when i wear them out  people keep asking me if they re beats  clearly  they ve never seen beats before lol   comfort  these are surprisingly comfortable  i have larger ears  and these fit very comfortably around them  sure there s slight discomfort at times and some sweating  but that s to be expected with over ear  i_can confidently say that i_can wear these for 4 hours and not really need_to_take them off once   multi_device support  so convenient to connect my phone and my laptop to these at the_same time so_i_don_t have to keep switching back and forth    navigation  it s incredibly easy_to_use  and connecting is a breeze  once you re connected  you never have to worry about it and can cycle through everything without touching what these are connected to  the clickable buttons are perfect_for not guessing what button you re using  cons    range  these are absolutely horrible sometimes with regards to range  i_ll have my phone_in my pocket  and sometimes the sound will go out while i_m walking  i had a pair of bluedio turbine s before this  and they enabled me to leave my phone_in my bedroom and go to my kitchen without any problem  yes even with walls in the_way   these however  can barely get through a song when i walk more_than 7 feet away  disgraceful    sound quality  let me start off by saying these aren t bad on sound persay  however  my personal tastes just weren t met  if you re a hip hop or r b lover  these aren t the headphones for you  the bass on my bluedio s wasn_t the greatest but it did the trick  these however  sound like the bass is happening two rooms away from you  very disappointing  i never tested quality with the aux cable  because let s be real  these are bluetooth headphones  if_i_wanted wired headphones  i would ve bought some    phone calls  while everyone could hear me fine  there was always a strange clicking noise in the_background according to those on the_other side  apparently it got really annoying at times  i never had trouble hearing other people  otherwise  answering and hanging up we re a breeze    battery life  i charged my bluedio s maybe once every week  granted  i_m a heavier than average user  but these headphones barely lasted two days  really frustrating when i have to keep them plugged in all the_time  overall  you re getting what you pay_for  however  compared to others of the_same price  this sacrifices a_lot just for minor improvements in aesthetics and comfort  if only these had more bass in them and a longer battery life  i think i_d be happier  for now  to the junk drawer you go  update 03 2018  i have received extremely courteous and helpful customer_service from this_product s manufacturer  patozon  they promptly contacted me after my review was posted  listened to my concerns  and provided me with a replacement product  mpow h1   while the mpow h1 was definitely better_than the mpow 059  it still had some similar issues while lacking the sleekness in design  all_in all  i am extremely impressed with the customer_service i_received from patozon  and will definitely consider them for my future purchases  however  as my original review was tied to the_product and not the_company  my stars remain the_same  comfy with caveats     the bad  if you have a large head  7 3 4  hat size   this item is_not for you  the muffs are comfy but the headband will most likely be too tight atop your head  the ample padding on the band  which is firm and not soft  the makes contact with the top of your head adds to the band being too tight  also   the controls  functions  for the headset are difficult to_see  no matter which color headset ordered  the symbols controls markings blend in with the_background of the headset  these should either be dimpled to distinguished by touch and or be a contrasting color  i e  red on black  green on black  white on black  instead_of a_very dull gray on black  now  most of the_time you ll use the controls when wearing the headset  but there will be times you ll use these functions when not wearing the headset  i e  pairing  charging  volume control  putting sound on hold  etc   lastly  because you can_t distinguish volume controls or channel selection by touch  you could accidentally change the station while meaning to minimize volume  the good  and this applies to 90   of the population   if the control issues i_mentioned don_t bother you  you ll like these headphones  they are comfy and has_good sound  but no noise cancellation no matter how high you have the volume set to your favorite song or video   bottom line  these headphones are going back to amazon for the reasons i stated  but i think i_m in the minority  most will like these headphones  i will say that these are not good to_use when doing cardio  perspiration accumulates quickly on your ears due to the muffs and also where the headband makes contact on your head  making it both frequent and sometimes difficult to wipe away sweat during a workout  earbuds are better   mediocre headphones or an adequate headset  can_t be both  these headphones are comfortable enough_to wear for an hour or two  but not much longer   and though the sound quality leaves  much  to be desired  you get what you pay_for where audio gear is concerned  bluetooth connectivity works with no trouble  and the option of pairing with multiple devices is appreciated  the microphone_is sufficient for voice chatting  1ch 16bit 8000hz  aka telephone quality  my main complaint with these headphones is the sound quality change that happens while you re using the mic  while using them as merely headphones  you can get readonably clear  2ch 16bit 44100hz  aka cd quality  audio playback   the speakers themselves sound awfully tinny and weak  but at least the playback quality is acceptable  however  as soon as you activate the microphone  the_quality drops significantly  to 1ch 16bit 8000hz  aka telephone quality  to match the microphone   imagine that instead_of listening to your favorite track on a normal pair of headphones  you re listening to it through your phone speaker  transmitted from your friend who s holding their phone up to their laptop speakers   it s awful  honestly  you re better off spending more money on better gear  if you have the option   but if you don_t  just know that you can either use this set as mediocre headphones  or an adequate headset for voice chat   never both at the_same time  if you like to listen to music while your game and wan to still leave your mic active  you should look for a different product  not bad  but certainly not great just charged these up_and paired with my headphones  first impression  not bad  but certainly not great  fit seems decent  but then again i_ve only had them on for 15 minutes so_far  sound seems muffled  especially at low volume  keeping phone volume high and lowering volume on headphone seems a_little better_than the_other way around  also seems better when i remind myself i only paid  34 for these  and my primary use will be for workouts at the gym or on my bike trainer  if you re after good music quality  spend more    if your primary use will be listening to the music you love  spend a_lot more     these will spend a_lot of_time banging around in my gym bag and just generally being abused  for my intended use these should work well  update   3 days later  muffed sound continues to bother me  these sound better at higher volumes  but i_like to listen quietly  not a_great experience with these  i think they re going_to_go back  good_and bad    i_purchased these headphones at the beginning of october and absolutely loved them  they sound awesome and they re pretty_good at blocking out background noise  the bluetooth connection has been a_little iffy since_i_got them so_i have just went to using the aux cable cord when this happens  used the bluetooth just_fine for the last couple_of days with no_issues until i_decided to charge it this morning since_it was_not connecting or reacting to pushing buttons  the red light did_not_come on  will turn_on when charging  and the side where you plug it in to charge got really hot  trying_to find any kind of online support from mpow is impossible and now my  wireless  headphones are back to being plain old plug in headphones  they still sound awesome  but now_i have to_buy a longer aux cord so_i_can do work at my computer_without having to sit so close to the_screen  time to find a different pair of wireless headphones      good as a bad     but the bad wins  i_love these headphones  they re comfortable  good looking and the sound is great  unfortunately  after about a_month now  they tend to short out randomly  they ll shut off  happening more frequently all the_time  and as soon as_i plug them in  i_can restart it  it s really unacceptable  i_d buy them again  or trade them in  but i_m not happy_with this particular set  like you d expect from almost any very cheap cans i_m starting to suspect that virtually all bluetooth headphone   earbud products in existence have flat frequency response  too much bass  and muddy highs  these cans certainly aren t doing anything to convince me otherwise  passive noise isolation is almost nonexistent  like you d expect from almost any very cheap cans  with the sound off  i_can can run my fingernails lightly over the wall behind me and still hear it quite clearly  total noise attenuation might be 4db  possibly less  the two high points so_far are    relatively lightweight   still comfortable after an hour i_m worried about the folding mechanism  i_m not certain just how many times i_can fold these before something snaps off  at least all    the moving parts appear to be some kind of light to medium steel  instead_of more plastic  i_got these as very inexpensive  relatively acceptable headphones that wouldn_t make me worry too much about theft or loss  i think they ll fill that niche  but that s as far as they go  
uncomfortable  headaches  poor ui i have mpow 059 and mpow h2 bluetooth over ear headphones  mpow ipx7 bluetooth earbuds  sennheiser wireless headphones  and bose noise canceling wired headphones  the sennheiser  bose  and mpow earbuds are comfortable_to wear for hours  the mpow 059 headphones clamp my head and give me headaches  i hate wearing them  the mpow h2 aren t any better  i took the rubber tips off the earbuds and they don_t occlude my hearing  i e   i_can hear normally  the mpow headphones block my hearing  but  unlike my bose noise cancelling headphones  the mpow headphones don_t actively reduce background noise  if_i_need_to reduce background noise  e g   on airplanes  then i_ll wear my bose headphones  not the mpow headphones  clamping headphones tightly onto your ears isn_t a_good way to reduce background noise  lastly  i couldn_t get the mpow headphone controls to_work properly  the_problem may be that i_can_t see the headphones controls with the headphones on  but i_can_t hear the messages when i take the headphones off  so_i hold the button down too long or not long enough  and it goes into pairing mode when i want_to power off the headphones  etc  in contrast  with the mpow earbuds i_can remove the right earbud  with the controls  while leaving the left earbud in my ear  i_can look at the controls on the right earbud and hold the correct button down until i hear the message in the left earbud   power off   etc  after a_few hours i_m starting to manipulate the controls without removing the earbud from my ear  the sennheiser headphones have separate switches and knobs for power  volume  and frequency  all_of which are easy_to_use  if you have a smaller head you may want_to keep looking  i read a ton of reviews before buying this_product and i was super excited to love them and use them daily  however  i ran into a_bit of a snag    first  all_of the things i_love about the mpow 059    they sync with my devices very quickly   quicker than my  300 headphones    i_love that they talk to me and tell me what commands i have given   e g  push the_power button and it will tell you  powering on  or if your headphones are already on it says  pairing   phone one paired     i_love that i_can feel the volume and track forward and back buttons easily   i_love the ear padding  it feels good on your ears as opposed to the cheap snap crackle pop you get with some of the_other ear covers out there  now for where things went wrong for me    the reviews i read mentioned a long charging cord one even showed a 4 ft cord in the review video  my charging chord was a_little over a foot and a half  not a huge deal but certainly not helpful when i want_to charge my headphones while wearing them in bed    the biggest challenge with these headphones was size  i had the headphones set at the smallest setting and there was no tension to keep them on my ears so the band across the top of the earphones put a painful amount of pressure on the top of my head  i wore them for a_couple_of days  adjusting the band on top of my head forward or back to try and alleviate the pain but no luck  i_love so_much about these headphones  i wish they worked for me but i just can_t take head pain  i hesitate sending them back  i_m not_sure i want_to deal with the hassle so_i_may just donate them to some lucky person  with a larger head   just be warned  if you have a smaller head you may want_to keep looking  insert sad face here  great headphones all around  read second update  good crisp sound  not noise cancelling  but they do a_good job of blocking exterior noise  i ride public transportation in chicago daily  so they are definitely tested  the range is good  never gives out no matter where my phone_is  even when it s in my backpack  not a ton of bass  but not bad either  comfortable and good battery life  i_use them daily and only plug them in to charge every other day and they have never died on me    update   the headphones have experienced their first true durability test  i_went to put my hood on as_i_got off the bus and inadvertently knocked them off my head on to the_hard cold concrete  i am six feet tall so_it was a_good drop  enough_to scuff up the right earpiece and dislodge the plastic circle around the pairing button  i am happy to report that headphones still work perfectly and the plastic piece popped right back in  no damage at_all other_than the scuff mark  excellent headphones    2nd update   unfortunately these headphones that i_loved so_much have let me down  after less_than six months of daily usage  the left earpiece has given out  there was no triggering event  one minute the earpiece worked and then it did_not  as stated before  these headphones did survive a fall a_few weeks back  but no events since  the failure was completely random  review reduced to two_stars due to poor longevity  muffled sound upside is they re fairly comfortable  build quality seems good  and bluetooth paired just_fine  you can use them over bluetooth  or 3 5mm  while plugged in to charge  although there s an audible electrical hum from the charger  no need_to turn them on use battery if you plug in 3 5mm  the downside is that sound quality is incredibly poor   i e  iphone earbuds and panasonic ergofits provide much clearer sound  at the_same price or less   the mids are present  but treble and bass are seriously lacking  sound is very muffled  i_m honestly not_sure if the set i_received was defective  or if these are just cheaply made  i_m returning them  update  mpow sent me an h2 set to try  these were better  but not great  i ended up purchasing sony mdr xb50ap earbuds  which sound much fuller for a_few dollars less  utterly disappointed  the cheaper mpows are much better and a steal for the_price  returning these asap waste of money  i_m utterly disappointed in my headphones  other_than amazing exterior build quality they need_to focus more on sound quality  the balancing of voice to background music is overwhelming almost no sense of quality base just a bare vibe sounding for base  i previously bought mpow headphones before for cheaper they didn_t look as_good_but they were about 10 dollars cheaper and sounded noticeably better the_only_thing these had on my previous one was build quality  comfort and better external sound buffering  i_m an avid listener of music and with these it just seemed off and not pleasing in overall sound quality like i said before the cheaper not so_good looking mpows are a much better buy  and for the_price i_expected better sound quality than the cheaper mpows i_m giving it two_stars because of the build quality and the shear comfort they provide  but those really doesn_t matter if the sound is horrid  everyone can hear what you re listening to i_bought these to_use at the office  but when i tested them out at home after i_received them  they leak sound like crazy  my wife could hear every word from several feet away at a normal volume  they sounded good  but i_don_t want my whole office hearing what i_m listening to  disappointed with audio quality these are the_first bluetooth over the ear headphones i have purchased so_i_don_t have a basis for comparison with other brands or models  the_price was_good_and the fit was fine for me  wearing comfort was ok but i haven_t worn them for an extended period of_time due to my issue with the audio quality  below   pairing was simple with my smartphone  operation with the buttons took a_little getting used to but worked fine  i haven_t used them enough_to comment on battery life  my major complaint with these headphones is the_quality of the sound  the audio was just dull sounding to me  mids and highs were poor and almost sounded muffled  bass was only ok  i played the_same music with a set of recently purchased mpow bluetooth earbuds and there was no comparison  the earbuds audio was bright and realistic even though they cost about 1 2 the_price of the over the ear headphones  edit 10 10 2017  my original review should have included the comment that for me the major complaint about the audio quality of these headphones is that vocals are coming through sounding muffled or dull and also seem to be at a lower level than the instrumentals on any track i listen to  instrumental only tracks sound ok  i unfortunately have just missed my 45 day money back return option so_i_m stuck with them  i just know_i would not purchase this item again or recommend them to others  mpow bluetooth headphones over ear  hi fi stereo wireless headset  foldable  soft memory protein earmuffs  w  built_in mic and wired mode for pc  cell phones  tv this headset is just okay one last update  one_star added for bella s amazing attitude and customer_service towards all this  the_seller has finally contacted me and was wonderful in wanting to help me out in getting a_new pair  however i_did return them and didn_t need a_new pair  but bella was very_nice_and took the_time to_make sure i was taken care of  took longer then i would have liked to_get this problem fixed but better late then never i always say     i am now giving this review one_star  just for the simple fact that the_seller didn_t want_to help me at_all  if_i could give it zero i would  after 4 failed attempts to contact the_seller  i just returned them  you are way better off buying something else  i_bought a_new headset that s way better and was way cheaper as_well  expensive doesn_t always mean better  when i_received this headset  it connected no problem to my ps4 slim  i_guess it doesn_t have wireless capabilities so_i had to have them plugged into my controller  which wasn_t a_problem for me  just unexpected  they are very comfortable_to wear and the charge lasted about 5 6 hours before i started to hear them cut in and out knowing i_needed to charge them  i_can not tell you how all the buttons work for i_got a faulty headset  that s why i gave them 2 stars  i contacted the_seller 3 times before just returning the headset and buying a different pair  not only did none_of the buttons work but the right side of my headset didn_t_work at_all  weak sound  ears hurt and get hot  the_only reason im not giving one_star is because these things were inexpensive  so sometimes you get what you pay_for  i regret this_purchase  the sound quality is very weak  i_can barely hear the bass compared to other headphones i own that are the_same price range  i even have some cheap earbuds that are way better sounding with deeper bass  i am disappointed also with how uncomfortable these are  i_can only wear them for about 30 minutes and i have to_take them off  they push in really hard and feel really tight on my ears  i_guess that would be a_good thing_if you were outside jogging or doing yardwork or something  because they will definitely not_come off easily  otherwise they are just painful after about a half hour  and also the make myvests super hot  it feels like theyre on fire  so  pain and hotness so uncomfortable  my old avantree bluetooth headphones are much more comfortable  eats dont get hot  and the sound quality is twice as_good  especially the bass   and i paid about the_same for them  if_i had more time on my hands i would return these for a refund but i_dont  i_guess im just going_to continue listening to my old headphones  maybe i will keep these as a backup pair but i_do_not recommend buying these  on the plus side  they do fold up  which most other over the ear bluetooth headphones do_not  so they go in a smaller case  i also bought the_case  other_than that  i would not recommend  i_guess i_cant hit a homerun with everything_i purchase on_amazon  oh well  onward and upward  may have to fiddle with it update feb  2018   despite trying for months i have been unable_to_get these to_work_with my desktop  the_product support team though responsive was ultimately unhelpful  they even sent me another component to try to pair with  all_in all  though the headphones are good my overall experience was dissatisfying and these are now just lying around because the return window closed long back  reducing another star due to the whole bad experience                                   i_ordered these last week alongwith a bluetooth dongle for my desktop  getting the mic to_work on applications like discord  skype etc has been a pain  ultimately figured out i had to have the headphones paired  and turned on  before the desktop booted  for some reason  the mic doesn_t_work_and picks up garbled junk if_i pair it later on  not_sure why and no idea if_it is the fault of the headphones or the dongle but fwiw the overall experience wasn_t smooth good sound and comfortable but a pain to_use first  the good things about this headset  it is very comfortable  i_can wear it all day  this is excellent for a noisy cube environment  when it s setup properly the stereo headphones sound great  the headset seems_to_work fine when you get it working  the batteries do last all day  i_ve not had them run out on me yet and i leave the headset on all day while at work_and plug it in to charge it up overnight when i leave for the day  it s also great to be wireless  now the negatives that are causing me to give this a 2 star review  i have this connected to my windows_10 computer via bluetooth  for some reason when you pair the headset to your computer_it shows up as 2 devices  the stereo headphones and a hands free headset  when one_is activated the_other doesn_t_work so when i want_to_use these to talk on my jabber soft phone_i have to_go and change settings that effectively shut off the headphone features and enable the headset  for some apps i have to_go into the headset properties in windows_10 and turn_on  listen to this device  to_get it so windows will hear the microphone  the_problem with this is it disables the headphones and i_cannot listen to music while that option is enabled unless i listen through the  hands free headset  device which sounds horrible for music  mono and just doesn_t sound good   maybe this is a windows issue  but usb headsets don_t have all these configuration complications  i_ve been able_to_make it work but it s a pain  and continues to be a pain switching between hands free and headphone mode  so so   comfortable  sound pretty_good  match my computer chair  the optional plug in or bluetooth feature is nice  future updates later  update  01 07 2018 the headsets are ok  nothing stellar  bluetooth is problematic to connect with from time to time  cuts in and out  no 33 foot range as stated  the sound quality is ok  nothing stellar  update  03 06 2018 just noticed you cant plug them in and utilize the corded feature to listen and charge the headsets at the_same time  also while pulled in there is a hissing sound in the_background  will be looking_for another headset as the bluetooth has now began to cut in and out enough_to be annoying  as the_computer_is right in front of me  but on the_other hand they look really good  needs an auto off or sleep option pros   very comfortable  great_price  stylish  great clear sound  strong battery life cons   claims to be better_than anc but they aren t at_all the biggest con for me is that there is no sleep or auto off option  i_wanted to_use these at night in bed to listen to my white noise app thru bluetooth from my cell phone  what i found out quickly is that because they never turn off  my morning alarm came on thru the headphones that i had thrown off to the floor the night before  so frustrating  nice headphones  died after less_than 6 months  customer_service was less_than_ideal first  these headphones are great  i_bought them for a work trip that had me doing a_lot of travel  they re comfortable  they block outside noise well  they fold down nice  the controls are easy_to_use  they sound good  the battery life is solid  they quickly became a part of my every day  i was using these things all the_time_and thrilled that they were so nice for such a reasonable price  then the battery died  i hadn t_even had them for 6 months and the battery died  what i should have done here is go through amazon to deal with this  but i contacted mpow directly  they responded reasonably quickly_and asked that i send the headphones back to them  they said they would check them and send back replacements  they even covered my shipping costs  at this point i was entirely satisfied_with the process  things break  parts die  i get it  but this is where it went south    after an extended wait  i_received my replacement headphones  they were all scratched up  the hinges were loose  the ear padding was beat up  the play pause button looked like someone had taken a thumb tack to it  and the line in jack was all beat up  they looked like hell  on top of that  one end of the line in cable was snapped off  i_don_t know_if they worked  i never tried them  when i contacted mpow about it  they just said to send them back and they would issue a refund  that s fine  but what i_wanted was a working pair of headphones  i_ve now spent several weeks dealing with this  and have a bad taste in my mouth about mpow  it s an acceptable outcome  i_guess  but i_m really disappointed at how the whole interaction went  so  these are really nice headphones  they had become essential gear for my everyday workflow  when they died  mpow basically shrugged  i_got my money back  which is nice  but what i_wanted was working headphones that hadn t spent three weeks in the bottom of a high schooler s backpack  i had these for two months and loved them  i even bought a second pair for     i had these for two months and loved them  i even bought a second pair for my son  i charged them two times  and they worked perfectly  then  mysteriously  i charged them again  and they no longer will hold a charge  i_can connect_to my phone when they are on the charger  but when i remove them  they don_t work  obviously  i want them for their bluetooth capability  pretty frustrating  1 19 2018 update the folks at patozon  who sold me this item  sent me a replacement shortly after i complained  i_ve had it for a_couple_of months now  and it works beautifully  they ve checked in numerous times to ensure my satisfaction  i_can_tell you now that this is the_best headset for the_money anywhere  and patozon is a marvelous company  don_t delay  grab you mpow headphones today  
let me down these seemed to be solid  awesome headphones but as_of today they mysteriously stopped being able_to charge and prematurely died on me at work after showing half battery life 10 min prior  had high hopes for these headphones as my job is very physical  hands on  up to 12 hour shifts but very_disappointed now  shows no red light indicating charging with multiple chargers on different outlets  two failures  i_purchased two of these on aug 18  2017  one failed in approximately 90 days and one_in 110 days  both outside the amazon return window  requested help  or at least sympathy  lol  from the shipper and received none  i_do recognize that the shipper does_not warrant the_product  however  they normally have a better rapport with the manufacturer they represent  the_units worked_great until they both failed to pair with any of several devices they had been pairing with  this is the_first negative review i_can remember giving  small and are not very loud  ive worn these twice now on a_few travels and overall they are garbage  1  after wearing for over an hour my ears start hurting from the headphones  my ears are not big or anything but the pressure on my ears felt like someone was tugging on them  2  i_know these are not noise canceling but i honestly could not hear hardly anything on an airplane  i sat in varies areas on a plane a_few trips  i had to_take them off and put my earbuds in  these will never be traveling with me again  3  not really a_good way to understand when they are turned off  4  i_guess my 6 year_old nephew will enjoy them since they kind of look cool  
sounds good_and stays put wow  i really like these wireless earbuds what makes them so great is that the acoustics are really outstanding and the buds stay comfortably in place in your ear and don_t fall out like other ear buds i have tried  they are stable in your ear because they use the contours of your ear to hold them in place  unlike some earbuds  they don_t have a piece of plastic that wraps around the outside of the ear which makes them uncomfortable_to_use if you wear glasses nor do they just wedge into your ear canal  instead there is a soft piece of plastic that gently lodges into the fold of your ear  they don_t fall out when i run while delivering excellent sound  of course these earbuds pair easily with my iphone as_i would expect  as to battery life  i usually have a daily walk around the lake in my city  over 10 miles   about 3 5 hours  and the rechargeable battery has never given me a_problem  they are very light weight and have a small magnet in each ear bud so when not in use they stay together in an organized way  they do everything ear buds should do and don_t do any of the things ear buds shouldn t do  beautiful piece of workout equipment  i really like these headphones  they arrived already charged up_and came_with extra ear buds and a neat little carrying case  connecting to my iphone for the_first time was super easy_and reconnecting is as easy as turning them on  i am not_sure exactly how long the battery lasts but i believe it ran out_of battery faster when i_made a call  it seems the battery lasts pretty long if you just listen to music  i just recharge after i come from a run while i take a shower  the sound is satisfactory  don_t expect beats sounds with them but for the_money and convenience  they sound very very_good  they are voice activated so you are alerted when you connect_to your phone and when you receive a phone call  it will tell you the number that is calling then it rings  i_like this feature because_i am using mostly during my workouts and i_use a running belt so_i_dont see the_screen of my phone  during my runs  i put the cable in front of me not back_of my neck  it is my choice but it seems it stays in place better in that way  something to keep in mind  i_love these headphones i_love these headphones  i was amazed by the sound quality as_it was nice_and clear  i even made some phone calls with it and it worked wonderfully  i_liked how the volume buttons were big as_i could see the clearly and they were easy_to push as_well as the smaller ones can be hard  the earpiece was stable when i was running in the park on some steep hills which is important to me as_i have had other wireless headphones fall out_of my ears and it is a hassle putting them in all the_time but these ones stayed in very_well  the earpiece is also very comfortable as_i had them in for over an hour when i was running in the park  i really like how the ear wings are labeled with an r for the right ear and an l for the left ear as_it makes it nice_and easy_to put the correct ear wing on and it is great how there are different size ear wings and ear tips to ensure and proper fit  lastly i_love how classy they look and how they magnetize together as_i_can keep them around my neck and won_t loose them  overall these are great headphones  especially for the_price  read the instructions carefully and have a magnifying glass handy though  these bluetooth headphones are incredible  i really like the_way they fit inside of the ear  very comfortable  there s other sized ear pieces for correct fitting inside of the ear to hold it nicely and softly  doesn_t fall out either  the curved peices you see are soft rubber and can be rotated to the proper place to fit inside of ear curves  it has a really clear sound and nice bass  i would recommend these to anyone who is busy and cannot have the plug in headphones  i_can walk away from my phone to about 30 feet before any connection loss happens  it also has a magnets in the_other end of ear bud  which is handy if you move around alot  great_for working out or driving  this is much better_than the_hard bluetooth headphones that tend to fall out_of the ears  the instructions to pair could be a_little bit better as_it doesn_t tell you to hold button until the blue light comes on  i wasn_t holding it long enough_to detect the headphones  all worked out well_and these really are nice headphones  very_nice headphones  i already had a set of bose     very_nice headphones  i already had a set of bose headphones  but decided to_get another_one because my boyfriend always keeps stealing mine    plus they were a_little too bulky for me  these on the_other hand     when i first opened the_box  they come in a_nice little sturdy container   i was relieved to find that the buds weren t too big  i have pretty small ears and it s a pain in the neck to find anything the fits  i put the smallest attachments on and they fit perfectly  in fact  they fit so well that the buds created a vacuum and made a_little suction noise when i pushed them into my ear  the earbuds themselves are very comfortable and surprisingly light without looking cheap  they charged pretty fast  there s a_little led indicator that_allows you to monitor their charging  finally for the sound  i_m not particularly a pro  but i_thought they sounded just as_well as my bose earbuds  and at a fraction of the_price  overall  happy_with this_purchase  that s great_for phone i_m a recent convert to trying two ear bluetooths as_i have been using one for quite some time  that s great_for phone  but not so_much for riding my exercise bike  walking  or playing poker  these connected quickly to my galaxy s9  and the sound is super  the in my ear works_well for me as_i_need a_lot of clarity on my sound  folks on the_other end of my calls also heard me well  all_in all very impressed by the sound quality  they store nicely with the magnet which keeps everything untanbled  on my desk  or around my neck  the long charge  i_got well over a day  close to two full days  without continuous use  is a plus  i get far less from my jabra stealth  i am very_happy  and would recommend to anybody looking_for a quality sound source at a_very reasonable price  fantastic quality bluetooth headphones for an affordable price after using the_same pair of  150 bluetooth headphones for the last 5 years  they had started to lose their charge  so_i_decided to try these dodocool headphones out  when i first put these headphones in my ears  they weren t quite snug enough  however  these came_with small  medium and large sizes of replacement ear pieces  so_i switched the default pieces out for the larger ones  and it made a big difference  color me impressed  the sound quality on these headphones is equal  if not better to my old headphones  i_can hear trebles  mids and lows  the bass in the headphones is also quite good_for bluetooth in ear headphones  these also stay in my ears a_lot better_than my previous set of headphones as_well  and being able_to control the volume and skip tracks is pretty essential  so_i_m glad that is built_in too  i_definitely recommend this_product  at this price  it s pretty much a steal   listening  these magnetic earbuds are awesome  they come_with a small  medium  large size ear hooks and cushions  the earbuds cord length is 20  long  i get about seven hours of continuous pandora radio with no skipping  it also comes_with a 19  charging cable and a really nice storage case  the earbuds take about two hours to fully charge from 0  and besides_not skipping during my music i really like that these are soft touch and don_t stick out too far from my head and that they are my favorite colors  the instruction manual was pretty average and the description photos are accurate  when you first pair these with your phone hold the button until it flashes red and blue then you can find it on bluetooth devices  the sound quality is excellent and i_m super happy_with my new earbuds  i hope this helps you  great sound and noise cancellation headphones  these lightweight and comfortable headphones really are amazing  the bass response is deep and highs are crisply pronounced  i_can wear them while using my treadmill and they say put in my ears with the provided flexible inside hooks  when i take them out the magnetic backs hold them around my neck so they won_t fall_off  the bluetooth connected very easily and fast with my phone  tablet and pc  just hold down the center button until the led flashes red blue and it will pop up on your bluetooth menu  i_love the nice zipper case it comes_with that offers secure protection plus a cool little elastic cargo net spot for the manual  mini usb and extra ear pads and hooks  i recommend these great lightweight headphones if your looking_for ease of use  great sound and cool travel pouch design  5_stars  great set of wireless earbuds  i_ve been wanting to try wireless  bluetooth  earbuds for a while  i go the gym on a regular basis and always get frustrated at getting the earbud cord tangled while running  sometimes  i would be running and the earbuds on my wired earphones would fall out  with these wireless earbuds  i_don_t have to worry about that problem anymore  the sound quality is pretty_good_for the_price that you pay as_well  the earbuds have a cushion similar to that of skull candy  as opposed to apple earbuds   i would definitely make this_purchase again in the future if needed and will suggest this_product to my friends and family  it is easy_to pair with just a volume button and a multifunction button  for power on off  pairing  end call etc   great sound quality so_far im highly impressed with these headphones   the sound quality is really great  especially for the_price  you do need_to read the instructions in order to learn how to_use them  since the home button basically does everything from answering a phone call to syncing with bluetooth  i_love the magnet on the earpieces  so_if you arent using them  you can connect them to each other around your neck  very cool  the_only downside is the_one_i_received had a short in one_of the wires  the_seller was easy_to_work_with though   promised to send a replacement to me  so for the_price  id say these are a_great_deal  if you get a faulty one like i_did  the_seller does seem to stand behind their products  perfect quality  great place  value for sure  extremely pleased_with these headphones  can_t say enough good things about it  first off the design  looks very high quality and has a sleek  sporty look  i_like how the buttons are large and raised for easy use without looking  and the headphones power on off quickly  i have also never had trouble with connecting  they usually connect_to my phone_instantaneously upon turning them on  the sound quality is crisp and clear  and the comfortable design forms a seal around your ears  which cancels noise very_well  i have never had trouble with them falling out and they have never showed signs of trouble  even after being exposed to a_lot of sweat during cardio sessions  all_in all  these are very_good reliable headphones  these earphones work great  these earphones are amazing  i have a_very athletic and active 15 year_old  my son needed a_great pair of ear buds  i_purchased these and he loves them  he can run and workout and these are comfortable  besides being wireless which helps to not get in his way  the earphones are very comfortable  they sit inside the ear but the ear piece is soft and flexible  it helps to_make the earphones stay out but does_not feel uncomfortable like many with hard plastic  it took my son about a half hour to completely get used to the feeling and since then he loves them  the sons quality is great_and there is hardly any noise coming from his ears  great overall quality the overall quality is very_nice  impressive black oval zipper case with red zipper matching the earphones  the larger buttons makes it easy_to manage the multi function middle button quickly  pairing  pause  play and answering calls  easy pairing and great sound quality  the lobe fins keep the plugs in firmly  i_like the magnetic strength that will no doubt keep the device looped around the neck with confidence when not in use  the initial charge took about 30 minutes to fullness indicated by a light change from red to blue  it seems long lasting but have not fully tested that aspect yet  very_pleased  these are really cool  i recently bought a pixel 2 and it doesn_t have a place to plug in my earbuds  so_i_ordered these  the_case is very_nice_and comes_with a pocket to hold the usb cord and extra ear pieces for a proper fit  the earbuds are comfortable when in the ear and i_love the magnetic feature so_i_can keep it around my neck without fear of losing them  very_nice sound  the bass sounded great  it is very hard to hear outside noises with the headphones in  i could not hear someone talking right next to me  overall  very_pleased_with this_purchase  really awesome  comfortable headphones  super quick ship  they arrived yesterday and i have been using them all morning  pairing was simple   just put your phone_into pairing mode and hold the multi function button down for 6 seconds  very_easy_to_use  sound quality is really good  for this price  it works for me   they come_with different size plugs and the curved rubber pieces for a custom fit  i_ve worn them all morning and i literally forgot i was wearing them  the_case is nice_and compact  fits in my purse without taking up a ton of real estate  i wish the cord was black or a neutral color  highly_recommend  comfortable  good sound and good fit  light weight  but good quality  the bright red colors help it to stand out a_little more which i really appreciate  the_case that it comes_with it really nice to have because the netting actually holds the cables in place  which the_other headphones i have tried before did_not have that  it charges quickly_and the magnets work to hold the headphones together when they are not in use  this is a_great feature that i never would have thought of but really appreciate because_i_don_t have to worry about them falling and getting lost  the sound is great_and they are comfortable  lightweight and with great sound  could not be happier with this_purchase  the_case is cool  it s always a_great surprise when you order one thing  only to open the_box and see something you weren t expecting  it was super easy_to pair them with my android phone  they re very lightweight and quite comfortable  the cord is just the right length  round cross section  and it doesn_t pull and grab on your neck like some  loved using it during my work out  my favorite color is red and love the color on this headphone  all_in all i_m very_happy_with my purchase and if something happens to these i will definitely buy_again  love the battery life  i really like these earbuds  first  the  fin  and the angle do a_great job of keeping the ear bud in place  i_use these at work where i_m cleaning and moving medical equipment  my old pair kept falling out to a point where the noise cancelling was_not effective  or it would fall out all the_way into dirty equipment  big and gross problem    the noise cancelling works_well  the sound quality is excellent for the_price point  the battery life is amazing   i get almost a full day out_of these  overall  i would absolutely buy them again  low price  high quality i_love the sound with these  i own a_very high end pair  and so_far  can_t tell the difference in the sound  and this_one has more features  like the magnet  brilliant  why didn_t someone think of this ages ago     i lost my first pair  had it draped over my neck  thought it was secure       not so_much  i also use audible  a_lot  to listen to books  and these work well for that  too  some of these headphones have too much bass and it s difficult to understand a book  not a_problem here  finally  i_like the red cord  another help for keeping track of them  recommend  good bluetooth distance sounds quality is really good  it took a_couple_of tries to connect it the_first time  however  i think it was just the learning quality  the sound quality is better_than my other head phones  treble notes are a_little muffled sounding  as a sound guy   i_can actually move away from my phone and it still works  the default ear pieces are on the larger side  however there is another set in the_case that are smaller  the_case seems very_nice_and roomy  i own another pair of bluetooth headphones that work pretty_good  these are as_good  these wireless headphones are great  im so_impressed with these headphones  they charged quickly with the cord included and synced to my iphone with no_problems  the sound is great_and they really are noise canceling  i_like that they can be used to talk on my phone  too  they come_with a_nice little case that will fit in most any size purse or pack so headphones wont get damaged  also comes_with different size earbuds so you have a perfect fit  the instructions are in extremely small print but once read with a magnifying glass  im 60  yrs   the use is easy  i would recommend  fantastic headphones for nice price these are pretty awesome headphones  no  they are not as_good as my  200 bose ones  but they do a fantastic job of drowning out annoying co workers who like to sing and drum in the office  also tested them out on the elliptical   i always get super sweaty while pushing hard intervals and these headphones stayed put  love it  fits comfortable and snuggly in the ear  i also like the fact that they come_with a hard shell case to protect them in my gym bag  super easy_to pair with my ipad  i would recommend these for the_price  these headphones have really good sound to them and come_with a_nice case these headphones have really good sound to them and come_with a_nice case  there are also different sized earbuds inside for you to custom it however you need  i_like that it has the ear wings to help stay in my ear when i am running  i try to_make my reviews as honest and thorough as possible  so that another person can know exactly what they would get  if my review was helped you at_all_in your considering this_product please hit the yes button below  it really helps amazon know people are reading the reviews  better quality i really like this bluetooth  the directions are not clear on how to pair it    turn_on the bluetooth  start the scan on your phone  hold down the multifunction button for 2  seconds  the device will pair   i have a different bluetooth device that makes speaker microphone noises everyone_i_move my head  this device does_not  it comes_with 3 pairs of in ear rubbers and 3 outer ear rubber guides  the sound quality is good_and i had no_issues being heard  i_like the carry case that comes_with it also  perfect_for active wear these are the_first headphones like these i_ve used  my spouse has gone through several pairs  though  so_i had him try these  too  the sound quality is excellent  i_used them to listen to an audio book  then music  the music was great   it played through the headphones without any hiccups  the audio book had problems and the audio would  pulse through the ear pieces to the point that i couldn_t listen anymore  however  i was listening to it at 1 75x normal speed and once_i slowed it back to normal speed  the_problems went away  it turned out to be the audio file  but it was frustrating while troubleshooting  problem solved and a_new book didn_t have any problems_with  pulsing  so_i_know_it was that particular file  the cord length is great   just right for multitasking  working out  in the yard  etc  without fear of them getting caught on something  i_m pretty happy_with them  for under  30 these are a_good buy good inexpensive set of headphones  pros  magnet keeps the two buds together when not in your ears  carrying case  molded buttons let you feel which button is which without looking  and about 6 7 hrs of battery with a 1 5 hr charge time  they are also loud and surprisingly bassy  cons  noise canceling seems a gimmick  and instructions are barebones  for less_than  30 i wouldn_t be too concerned  these are worth the_money as a backup set or something to_take on a long flight  great little bluetooth headphones these were a hit for me  the sound was pretty_good  cord was a_good length  the ear pieces fit well in my ears  i_loved the_case it came_with so_i_can_take it to the gym in a small pouch without it getting lost in between my gym clothes  magnetic so they can attach together around my neck when not in use and they won_t fall_off  only negative i found was_initially they were a_little more difficult to pair with my iphone  i_ll be using these for a while hopefully     immediately connects to bluetooth  no_issues  i have had difficulty pairing bluetooth devices to my iphone  i_don_t know what the issue is  but this doesn_t give me that problem  it immediately connects  i_love that this is able_to stay in my ears throughout my hiit workouts and is able_to keep up with me  the wire itself doesn_t get all twisted like my other ones  nothing_is more annoying when it twists up behind your neck because_it gets caught up in my ponytail  i_love these and i_m so happy_with my purchase best hadohones so_far  i have only tried these at the gym twice  but i am loving these  firstly  they fit better in my ears and they dont fall out like my last set with similar earpeices  the cord is also softer  so_it doesnt tug or cause the earpiece to move twist while you are  the inly thing that is_not complete is the noise canceling feature  i_can still hear voices and the piped gym music  but other_than that  i really like these  they also come_with a_nice case to put them in  pretty_good_and light  these do_not fit as_expected  i_thought the loop would go around my ear  it doesn_t it goes inside  but works_well  i tryed the on and i_m a_lot happier than_i_thought i would be  they aren t super loud  but they are louder than most i have tryed and are pretty clear for the_price  i own an expensive pair that has the plastic piece around the neck  i hate those because they fall_off when i_m benching  these are light and won_t do that  this bluetooth headset came_in a really nice storage case wow  this bluetooth headset came_in a really nice storage case  music sounds great  they charge lasted a_little over 8 hrs  they are comfortable in the ear even with sensitive ears as mine  the hooks give added support so the buds don_t fall out  i_like the magnet fasteners so the headset can remain around the neck when not in use without getting lost  they easily paired with my iphone  there was one con    the directions are in really small print that i_needed a magnifying glass to read them  bargain headphones for how well it works i am quite happy_with this_purchase  considering the_price paid for the headphones  they work very_well  the connection to bluetooth was very simple and the sound from the headphones is great  the headphones stay right in the ear and to my surprise  the noise cancellation actually drowned out the outside noise  i would buy them again if_i lost these and recommend them to those looking_for a quality bluetooth headphones  my dad loves it  i_bought these for my dad because_it got irritating whenever he was driving and got a phone call he would just reach for it and endanger everyone_in the car  thank goodness for these we can all rest comfortably knowing he will be driving safely  and these pair very_well with the iphone 7 and up  the_only_thing left to_do at this point is think of the next great gift for the upcoming mother s day  very_pleased  finally a pair of headphones that work to block sound  these are noise canceling for sure and it was so convenient they came_with a carrying case and additional buds to fit my smaller ears  also the control on the cord is perfect_for vol and song control  ive jumpped rope  done burpees  and yoga head stands and these things dont fall out  i felt a review was essential with these  very_pleased  nice packaging  case nice packaging  case  different sized ear pieces  charging cord  instructions etc  headphones charged very quickly  very_easy_to pair device  great sound quality  very comfortable in the ear  buttons on unit easy_to operate and feel  volume up down   very impressed with the_quality of these headphones at a fraction of the_price of others  highly_recommend this_product  very_pleased       different bluetooth headphones and it seems_to the the_best one yet these headphones are probably my 4th different bluetooth headphones and it seems_to the the_best one yet  they slide in comfortably in my ears and they don_t fall out when i play basketball  the bass is pretty decent for being small headphones and doesn_t  break  the music  i am no expert but they seem like a_good set for sport and gym in general and it comes_with a small case which is nice  will update if there are any issues_with it  aesthically pleasing  lightweight  buttons you can actually press the bundled ear caps and ear hooks are actually practical and fit according to your ear lobe hole size  magnetic feature is cool but doesn_t provide much since this pair comes_with a small case  couldn_t really tell the difference between a pair without the noise cancelling and this pair  especially since they are in ear headphones  paired right away with my wifes iphone 6s  all around solid product these headphones were great  with the multiple pieces i found one that fits perfectly  the color was great  i really love red and black together and these were no exception  in addition people do buy headphones for the sound  the sound was super clear on these  i am very_happy i_bought them and will probably get another pair just to have as a back up for the gym i_love the fact that the buttons are easy_to feel which is which  great fit  i_love the fact that the buttons are easy_to feel which is which  no guess work  they work great  have great sound quality and feel great  the_only_thing that surprised me was how they stick out_of your ear  they stick out a_lot  though it is_not uncomfortable because they are lightweight  mine_came fully charged  great_buy  nice little pouch to keep them safe too  money well spent an avid runner and fitness junkie  i was excited to put these to the test  i_cant tell you the number of headphones ive tried out  including big name brands  and hated  if they dont stay in your ears whats the point  i am very_pleased_with these little gems  easy_to carry in your purse  fast sync and best of all they stay put    well_worth the investment      is the second bluetooth headphones i_ve purchased and they re pretty_good  it has clear sound quality for music     this is the second bluetooth headphones i_ve purchased and they re pretty_good  it has clear sound quality for music and audible audiobooks  once_i get used to bluetooth headphones  i_can_t go back to those old fashioned wired headphones  they are light light and comfortably fit to my ears  nice pair of affordable bluetooth headphones and highly_recommended  headphones with great features  these headphones are great_for the_price  first and most importantly   the sound is great  canceling out some outside noise  they fit very_nicely in the ear and are very comfortable  they won_t fall out very_easy  the magnetic feature on the buds is great so you won_t lose them  comes_with usb charger and lasts for about 8 hours  zip everything up in a_nice carry case  give them a try  spend the  30 on these  they are worth it  i usually go pretty cheap on headphones but i knew that i_wanted to_get some bluetooth ones for working out and just to have around my neck  i saw the description and reviews and thought i_d take a chance on these  they are awesome and i_don_t know how i could listen to my music without having a pair of these  love the_price_for the amazing quality  they sound awesome  my new gym buddy  i_love these  they are very light weight and small profile  easy_to keep in  the carrying case that they come in is super convenient also  i just throw them in my gym back and don_t have to worry about them getting all tangled up with stuff in my bag  easy_to operate and the instructions are very straight forward  very_happy_with my purchase  i_m picky and these are amazing  these are amazing  i am a sound audio enthusiast  so usually stay away from the wireless headphones due to poor quality  these  however  greatly surprised me and surpassed expectations  very comfortable  great spectrum of sound  long battery  have yet to_run them out  awesome product  excellent earbuds  what a_great pair of earbuds  shipped fast  easy_to_use  nice sound  i_can definitely notice the noise cancellation feature which makes the music even more enjoyable  the bass is just right to me  not too overpowering  vocals sound clear and crisp  bonus   i_didn_t expect it  but they come in a_nice storage case  really nice_and good sound quality i was looking_for decent earbuds to_use at the gym because my other ones were cheap and wired and just didn_t fit right in my ears  i was always pushing them back in or adjusting them  these are really nice  they are bluetooth which is a plus and they even come_with extra ear hooks of different sizes  the sound quality is pretty_good too  overall  i_m satisfied_with the_purchase and recommend them to anyone looking_for decent earbuds  great bluetooth headphones  secure and comfortable  a solid bluetooth headset im really enjoying  i_like the soft silicone ear piece  comfortable and doesnt fall out  good sound  maybe a_bit heavy on the bass  but appropriate sound at the_price level  i hadnt realized it would come_with a_nice zippered case  that will be handy and looks sharp  excellent product  competitive with name brand for sure  amazing what quality you can get these days without having to pay a_lot  makes me regret spending so_much on those name brand headphones in years past  excellent sound quality and range  plenty_of volume which even the more expensive brands always seem to lack  easy_to_setup_and comfortable_to boot  nice set of headphones  these headphones are a_lot clearer then wired plugin headphones  i plugged them into charge watched a movie and then have been listening to an audio book off and on all afternoon and they feel comfortable in the ear and are still running  excellent for gym use as_well would definitely recommend this_product they are light and easy_to theow in your gym bag with out having to worry about a tangled mess  good sound quality good_price  poor instruction  good quality sound  the bass is good_for such a small ear bud  i listen to them in the office and on 1 bar of volume they are a_bit loud but that is probably due to the noise cancelling  crystal clear sound  remember to hold the on button until its descovered for pairing  parents loved these work great  i had gotten a different brand of these for myself but my parents have been asking for wireless headphones  i_thought these would be a_good fit because they re magnetic and they work great sound quality was nice when i_tried them out and my parents had no_complaints good_price_for a sturdy product with great sound  love how sturdy and durable the wires are on this headset because_i plan to_use it for listening to music as_i run  it is easy_to_use  for phone calls i_like the sound on my end and those i_m speaking with have commented on the clear crisp sound on their end  great phone for the_price  quality bluetooth earphones these headphones work great  the_quality of the build is really sturdy and nearly identical to my  name brand  earphones  the sound is great_and the buds fit nice_and snug in my ears  i think these are a_great_value and the connection to my phone was really easy  i really like that they provide a case to store everything i really like that they provide a case to store everything  the charging light indicator is a_bit small and not as_noticeable  very comfortable fit  the_only_thing_i_didnt like is that_even with my iphone being on 1 bar volume  the actually volume is a_bit higher than_i would like  great affordable bluetooth earbuds  this is the 2nd pair of bluetooth earbuds i_ve owned and so_far they re pretty perfect  quality feels really good  i_m happy_with sound quality for listening to music and audiobooks  if you re an audiophile you may want_to_go more expensive  but then you probably don_t want earbuds either  these are great_for working out and everyday use so_far  i_ll update this review if my opinion changes with use but right now_i_d highly_recommend them for the_price  great_price  great sound  great_product these headphones are excellent at blocking out background noise and fit very comfortably in my ears  these are very lightweight and do_not pull on your ears  these headphones are

good sound   low cost   buy i_purchased the  dodocool  bluetooth headphones and have been using them for about 5 days now  the are an_excellent choice  especially for the lower cost  these headphone are the earbud kind that come_with three different size ear cups as_well as with little arm extensions that help secure them in your ear  you do_not feel these little arm extensions in any way  the ear cups provide adequate ambient noise isolation once you find the right size   most comfortable ear cup size for you  sound is  good  bass is a_little muddled  i_use them with spotify on an android which allows me to equalize the sound to my liking  i was able_to clean up the bass somewhat via the equalizer  the instruction manual  photo attached  is somewhat brief and will likely confuse someone who is_not familiar with common ways these type of bluetooth devices are paired with phones  note that it would not pair with a pc bluetooth transmitter that you hook up to your pc audio jack  not really needed by me  but thought i would try  i wouldn_t expect any issues_with connecting to a phone at_all  i found that while walking around with these in my ears  there was quite a_bit of sound noise transmitted through the cable connecting the two ear buds  i_can minimize this somewhat by positioning the cable inside the collar of my shirt  but the thunk bump thunk sound when the cable hits your collar is somewhat distracting and might be a factor if jogging with these  don_t know_if this is an issue with all types of these type of headphones or not  the cable noise and slight instructions cause me to give up one_start  however  i_do really like these ear buds  with their good sound and low cost  they are a_good buy  if_i want perfect  i would expect to pay triple or more  best fitting bluetooth headphones for the gym  they dont fall out fit   these are the_best fitting headphones for the gym i have tried and i have purchased multiple pairs from different brands  these do_not fall out during lifting or on cardio machines  very snug fit  rate these 5 5 battery life   is approx 8 hours and i_got that  you will get a battery low message a_few times before they die  wished battery life was longer closer to 10 hours like novu brand  this is enough for 1 week at the gym before charging  rate these 4 5 sound quality    heavy on bass response  not enough treble  if you like your beats with bass these headphones are for you  novu sound better  rate these 4 5 quality   is very_nice  nice case and overall a_great build quality  rate these 5 5 overall  best fitting bluetooth headphones  bass heavy  great build quality  overall rate these 4 5  if battery life was 10 hours and treble was better would rate these 5 5  definitely dodocool is worth a look if you hate your headphones falling out when at the gym  great headphones for a low price    i am impressed by the_quality of these headphones are such a_great_price  they seem to_work very_well for me while walking  the headphones came_in a_great carrying case and have great features for the_price  i would definitely recommend them for a_great low cost headphone  the charging time was less_than two hours and they lasted almost 8 hours for me  great wireless buds for any age if there was 1 2 a star  i would rate these 4 5  they are compact and feel durable  love the magnetic feature if you pop them out_of your ears they still stay together  music quality is clear at any level of volume  bonus is the small carrying case  love it  good_product that i will definitely recommend to friends   family  
decent  but not the_best i_m not quite sure how i feel about these headphones  when i_received them  my impression was quite good  the packaging was done well  they arrived quickly  and the headphones  and all the accessories that came_with it  were within this cute little black and red hard carrying case  the instructions were also_in there  and if you read them it s quite easy_to pair the headphones with your device  for the purposes of this review  i tested them with both my laptop and my phone  pros one_of the good things about these headphones is the sound quality for the_price  i_thought they were pretty decent  definitely a more bass heavy product  but the sound came out clear  without much static   there was slight noise cancelling from the suction of the earbuds  which is always a plus  in addition  the length of the wire connecting the two earbuds was a_good length  the calling functions worked quite well  and the earbuds did stay in my ears  that last one surprised me a_bit  because my past experience with this kind of earbud has been that they fall out  the headphones lasted 8hrs on their first charge for me  which was as_advertised in the_product description  cons the_first thing_i_docked a star for was the sound  the sound quality was_good  however  i encountered two other issues  for some reason or another  when i would increase the volume to test how loud how soft the headphones go  the jump between volume levels at one point was  drastic   one volume level was too low and the_other was  much  too loud  also  it did_not help that the sound in the left ear was significantly louder than the sound coming out_of the right ear  the right ear s volume was like a whisper compared to the clear  deep notes in the left  which made my experience with this_product suffer  the second thing that i_docked a star for was comfort  one_of the things influencing this decision was the earbuds themselves  while they did stay in my ears  i tested to_see how comfortable they would be to wear for extended periods of_time  i  personally  found they got almost itchy  and started to feel a_bit hard in my ears after around the 1hr mark  at which point i_likely would ve taken them off  secondly  the magnetism between the earbuds wasn_t that strong  it was enough that they came together  but they were easily separated  and if some of my hair got between the wire and my neck  they would not stay clipped together at_all  for the_price  these headphones aren t bad  as_i said above  the sound quality is quite good  and i think some people would enjoy these as exercise headphones  however  i_don_t think this would necessarily be the_first pair i would recommend  i_bought some really nice_and expensive headphones with noise cancelling that are amazing i_bought some really nice_and expensive headphones with noise cancelling that are amazing  i was using them with my big zero turn mower and could barely hear the mower running when listening to music  however  it is starting to_get hot and dusty and i_didn_t want_to ruin them  so_i_thought i would give these a shot  the good  in my opinion  these had excellent sound  the bass sounded great_and they are very light and easy_to pair and use  overall  i really like these  they were comfortable for wear for about 2 hours  the bad  i could not tell there was any noise cancelling going on  i had to crank the sound all the_way up just to hear the music over my mower  they are not ideal for noisy environments and i think an old school pair of earbuds that go further into the ear would cancel out sound much better  


better_than beats headsets these are perfectly good headphones and quite economical  i_bought them after being frustrated by my second pair of beats over the ear headphones  and a third in ear set of beats  that broke for no good reason  beats are expensive  they dont sound all that much better_than these  and they are of insufficient construction quality  so  this pair became my solution and im happy_with them  the_only_thing_i_miss from the beats is the removable audio cable  the audio cable on these headphones are permanently attached to the headphones  a minor point  but i_did like the removable cable on the beats  very efficient yet amazing deep  varied smooth clean bass with overall excellent     hard to believe  honestly   11 headphones  very efficient yet amazing deep  varied smooth clean bass with overall excellent pleasant mids and highs  clean quality astounding with dynamic depth   again hard to believe  i am sitting here in awe listening to music on my phone  never sounded so_good  the surprising part is i_got them for my ham radio rig  thinking they would be ok  never expected what i am hearing as they playback great sounding music from low power device with such efficient volume and solid clean bass  i have spent  100s on headphones of all types  these are incredible for the    wow    great quality for the_price  i_m so surprised by the_quality of these headphones given the_price  seriously  the audio quality is better_than my apple headphones  i_ve read a_few reviews that say they ve broken the headphones a_few weeks after purchase just due to poor material  so_i_m being extra careful with them and so_far_so_good  i would definitely recommend these  the mic works_well with my macbook and iphone  and the actual headphone_is a tiny bit smaller than my ear but it s_not a huge deal to me  it still fits well  and doesn_t hurt me even after three  hours of use  i have yet to_use them with my gaming controller  i_m curious to_see if_it would work  but_even if_it doesn_t   still a_great pair of headphones for the_price  i would purchase again if anything were to happen to my current pair  to be honest  hope this review helps  wallet is still full and so are my ears  first off let me say  i wasn_t expecting much from a   15 pair of headphones  the plug on my sony pair actually ripped off when my computer fell to the ground so_i_decided to pull the trigger and buy these  they are compact when folded  the packaging was tiny  and they fit perfectly on my huge noggin  i_m no audiophile but i would say the sound is adequate and levels are great  you don_t get too much of anything but every level is where it needs to be in every type of media i have pumped through them  if you re looking_for super bass  not gonna find it here but the bass translates at a perfect level through the_drivers  i would get these if you are looking_for a decent pair of headphones and don_t want_to commit to draining your wallet  great comfortable headphones at a_good_price  great sound and build quality for the_price  i_ve gone through a small collection of headphones  everything from gaming headsets out to the standard tech store sets  and after one_of my old gaming headsets needed to be replaced  it fits comfortably on the ears and has a_good bass and sound and folds up quite nicely and compactly  the stainless steel plug and the durable rubber coating on the cord is a_nice touch as_well  and it s just perfect  stunning quality  for the low cost  the sound quality is superb  i_ve had headphones seven times more expensive that didn_t sound this good  to test noise reduction  i listened to music through these while my family watched a comedy on tv  and the headphones worked excellent over my husband s extremely loud laughter  one brilliant little aspect of these which i_ve never seen on other headphones or earbuds is a small spring attached directly above the headphone jack  over the last couple_of years  we ve purchased no less_than twenty sets of headphones and earbuds  and every one_of them have had issues around the headphone jack which causes loss of sound in one ear  hopefully  this will correct that problem  if not  i will update  the_only negative  which isn_t huge for me but may be for someone else  is the cord length could be longer  they re fourteen dollars and they are great i have been wanting headphones for a long time  between my television  tablet  and phone being either dolby 7 1 or 5 1  ear buds just don_t cut it  for christmas_i treated myself to a pair of high end headphones and love them  i had been using ear buds at the gym and found they were always falling out  i could hear everything going on around me  now  i certainly didn_t want_to bring the good headphones to the gym  i_mean  nothing would happen  but something could happen  i_use a kindle fire hd 8 tablet at the gym  just so you can look up the audio specs  the_price was right  it seemed like people were happy_with this  pros  1  the_price  if they break  i am not going_to cry  2  one wire  i find that makes exercising easier because you can choose where you want the_one wire to lie  3  reasonable noise cancellation  these are not noise cancelling headphones  nor do they make the claim   but thanks to the padding  it eliminates a preponderance of the surrounding noises  the gym has music playing and announcements and i_didn_t find them distracting at_all  contrast that with ear buds where i couldn_t listen to my shows well  4  light  i_don_t find them distracting  i_do the treadmill for cardio  so_i am standing and bouncing around  i_don_t feel like a boa constrictor is coiled around my skull or that a bag of flour is atop my head  5  the sound is perfectly reasonable  again  this was a purchase with a specific use  i e  going_to the gym  i am not listening to the symphony  i watch tv shows while doing cardio  i am not an engineer  so_i_can_t debate specs with you  but take it from a layperson  these are fine  i_used them at home to compare with my hoo hoo headphones and found that bass response is worse and there is a less feeling of three dimensional sound  but this was never expected  if you are demanding exacting standards from headphones which cost less_than a movie ticket  you answered your own complaint  6  no one has complained about the_quality of the sound when i_used the microphone for telephone calls and whatsapp calls and messages  eta  7  the plug is really nice with a sturdy metal construction and a spring around the end to keep it from fraying  cons 1  the padding is covered with pleather  it does get sweaty  this is a minor complaint  but i am accustomed to foam and being able_to purchase replacements  2  they cannot be treated in a cavalier manner  they are fourteen dollars  they are not going_to survive being thrown around  i wrap mine in a towel in my gym bag until i_macguyver some kind of case  assuming i have the gumption to_do so  my gut feeling tells me these would break rather easily if thrown around or if they were not packed carefully  they fold nicely into a flattened pattern  see promotional photos   eta  upon closer inspection  they are stronger than_i_thought  yes  they are all plastic with some chrome accoutrements but it does feel strong  i think these would snap under stress though  the plus side is a_little gorilla glue would get you back to_work  3  this is a small complaint  but i find the volume adjustment  play  pause a_little too high up on the cord  i_don_t know_if this is due to microphone placement  but i wish it were farther down the length of it  i am 6  2  tall  so the controls dangle around shoulder height for me  so  if you are like me and wanted headphones instead_of ear buds to_use but also wanted  needed a microphone  these are great  if you have little impish children who easily break their toys  this is good_for them  the sound is fine  they work fine  just don_t be throwing them around or letting them jostle in your duffel bag  i have had them two weeks and used them for twelve trips to the gym  i am quite happy_with them  you should be also  they are fourteen bucks  very comfortable   able_to wear for long periods without being     what a difference  i had the volume turned almost to max to hear clearly with my old headphones  when i plugged this guy in  pow   controls way to the_other side leaving lots of room for adjustment  very comfortable   able_to wear for long periods without being aware of them  it would be nice if the cord were about a foot longer  though  clear and consistent sound   highly_recommend i_m a_little hard of hearing so_i_use this primarily on my computer so_i_can watch shows and have the volume up louder than_i would normally play the tv  i had another elaborate headphone and found that the voices did_not_come through clearly at_all even at top loud volume  these work great  just bought another set for my grandkids when they listen to cd s here  the sound is great  its clear  and i_don_t have to have it all that loud to be able_to hear well   very_good_for the_price the coloring of the headphones was very_nice_and exactly what my brother wanted  i particularly loved how small the packaging the headphones came_in  according to him  the speakers are of great quality  i just might have to_buy another pair for myself  fantastic sound  can_t believe these are so low priced  fantastic sound  a much better  fuller  robust sound than apple earbuds  while these are a tiny bit big for my head  they are very comfortable_to wear for long stretches at a time  the microphone_is placed fairly well up the left side  but provides good voice quality  the controls are easy_to_use and cord is high quality   it_even has a_nice metal plug with metal spring   very upscale      for someone else and they were so cushioned and nice sounding that we ordered two more pair we ordered one pair for someone else and they were so cushioned and nice sounding that we ordered two more pair  love the volume adjust feature and the_one sided cord too  great_price_and great_product   thank you  nice cheap headphones nice headphones for the_price  they seem to be well made and durable  and they are very compact when folded  the_only complaints i have are that the ear pads are a_little stiff  although this could change with more wear  and that the head band is too big  and i_don_t exactly have a small head   otherwise excellent for the_price  great sound  compact size i_bought these so_i_d have a compact set of headphones to travel with  the earbud style just don_t work for me on a plane  these were just  14 and they have great sound  especially for the_price  what i really like is they fold up to a small size  when folded  they are a_little smaller than my hand and they fit in a quart size ziploc with room to spare  very comfortable and excellent sound quality   and a_great bargain i really like these earphones  they are light weight and are very comfortable  i_much prefer them to the uncomfortable earbuds that i_used in the past  admittedly  they take up more space than the earbuds  but they are very compact  sound quality is excellent  much better_than_i was expecting considering the very reasonable price  needed new headphones i was_in need of some new headphones  because_i sat on and broke and had to tape up my old ones  i recently received a  75 amazon gift card  after thinking of what to_get  it hit me to purchase some new headphones  they re my favorite color red  the sound and bass is excellent  they seem sturdy    great sound  sensitive mic the sound quality is incredible at this price range  i was really impressed with the sound and build of the headphones  the_only_thing_i_didn_t like was the microphone  which picks up a_great amount of outside sound  i_tried_to record something and can clearly hear myself but also the_background noise  if_i touch the cord the mic will make a rattling sound  i_bought this to_make phone calls but for listening to music this is a_great_product  he says that these headphones are one_of the_best wired headphones that he has had my brother absolutely loves these headphones  i_got these for him since he can not use bluetooth headphones  he says that these headphones are one_of the_best wired headphones that he has had  he enjoys the loud clear sound of the bass and music it put out  he even said that these are almost comparable_to beats but way less on the_cost  so overall i_guess he loves these headphones and kinda makes me want a pair of my own now  good_product i_purchased these phones for use with a ham radio and for this they have been great  i_can wear them for prolonged periods of_time very comfortably  they also sound great when plugged into a stereo system  for the_price  these things sound quite amazing  i_m more_than happy_with them  for less_than  15  i was totally surprised of the_quality of these headphones  seem very durable  use daily  for walking  should be perfect  for my daily routine  sound quality is the_best of any i have ever listened to  in my life  honestly  i have never spent  15 for headphones  in my life either  less_than  10  but if_i_didnt know how much they cost  i truly think they would be  50 or more  all metal cord plug with spring cord protector  we accidentally ordered 2  glad we did  less_than  15  deserves a six star rating  let you know_if anything changes  best headphones ever     these headphones are wonderful     the sound is very clear  very_good volume control     great_value and quality for the_price i have had these headphones for about 4 weeks now_and they are still working_great  i am so shocked and surprised at how well they sound and feel  i_got them as an extra set of but now use them exclusively over my more expensive ones  great_product  the sound is excellent with great bass     great_product  the sound is excellent with great bass and treble  def  super quality and great_product for thr money  i would highly_recommend gis for anyone wanting a_great set of ear phones for stereo quality   didn_t expect the results i_didn_t expect these to be as_good as they were  the pads were really nice on the ears and the sound quality was really good as_well  over all these worked really nicely  and i_ve had them for a_couple_of months  great  these headphones are awesome for the_price  sounds alright  length is good  even has a spring near the end so_i cable doesn_t bend too much  great  cant control the volume in the car so     great  cant control the volume in the car so you have to_set it before a trip is all they are a_great_value for the_price i_bought these as a cheap set of headphones so_i could work at the_computer late at night  i was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality of these head phones  they are a_great_value for the_price  so_far i_like everything about these head phones so_far i_like everything about these head phones  they seem durable  and the sound quality is clear  they are comfortable on the ears too  will revise this review if something changes  comfortable and good quality works_great  my son is using them for his kindle  he says they are comfortable  comfortable  great amplification  perfect_for me as a hearing impaired user i certainly wasn_t expecting much with the_price of these earphones but boy  i was wrong  they are very comfortable_to wear  the amplification is great  i am hearing impaired and have trouble hearing through some earphones but the sound is loud and clear in these  i had to turn the volume down more_than half using them  i had some sony earphones previous to these and i had to turn the volume up all the_way to hear through them  as an added bonus  there are volume controls on the cable that plugs into the sound jack pretty_good  on a scale from 1 to 10  i am no audio expert  these headphone sound good  good clarity  good bass  fold up well  and pretty comfortable  like i said  don_t know much  but very_happy_with the performance for the_price  excellent on ear headphones excellent on ear headphones  comfortable  the connector has a metal spring on it  so_i anticipate that the plug will not break too soon  decent sound for the_price  the microphone works_fine  no_complaints from callers  i_use it for my cell and for my computer  perfect headphones for bte hearing aids these on ear headphones work great over my behind the ear hearing aids  no feedback and i_can still hear conversations thru my hearing aids while wearing headphone  low price makes them prefect for travel where the chance of loss or breakage is greater  i just wish they came_with a storage pouch  the single cord is a real plus  i wore them for 3 hours yesterday with no discomfort  i plan on using them with my iphone x and ipad  five_stars just great very surprising sound the headphones have exceptionally good sound quality  if you listen on your computer right click to change your sound quality  it will be phenomenal  got them as a gift for my niece who complained     got them as a gift for my niece who complained that her earbuds hurt her ears  she says she likes them  which is a miracle for a teenager  lol  he says they are comfortable and that he cant hear the rest of the     i_got these for my son  he loves them  he

five_stars great earphones  nice price  work well  bought two within a_week  
the swiveling cups allow them to find a sweet spot to have them sit both comfortable and help     surprisingly these have impressed me when i_did_not expect it  they are light weight and and have several adjustments that can be made to have them fit most people very_well  the cups are soft  cover your ear well_and do_not put that squeezing pressure against your head  the swiveling cups allow them to find a sweet spot to have them sit both comfortable and help keep outside noises  the_drivers are decent and can push a_good amount of volume out for your enjoyment  the sounds are clear and not really much distortion on the bottom ends  which surprised me the most  i have come across headphones at twice this price_and were not as_good as these  for the_price i_can not see many people being unhappy_with this selection  this is a_good_product  i wish they were over the ear this is a_good_product  i wish they were over the ear  but they have good sound quality and great range  the cord is nice_and long too  worked excellent at first i_m giving these 3 5_stars only because their customer_service was_impeccable  the headphones worked for maybe a_month  and then they started to malfunction  the volume would go up_and down on its own  it would open up some weird app on my phone that was disabled  and also drop calls  at first they worked they great  no_issues at_all  they are a_little large and i have a regular sized head but nothing that was too much of an issue  i contacted customer_service about what was happening and they resolved the issue with no hassles  i would recommend these because_i_m thinking maybe i_got a bad pair because most of the reviews are excellent  does_not block noise when not turned on a previous review suggested that these on ear phones would black out extraneous noise  not true  actually  noise from ambient music and conversations passes easily into these headphones  having said that  the phones do a decent job of blocking out ambient conversations and music when in operation  it is_not necessary to turn up the volume to a dangerously high level  the sound quality  judging by other phones i have owned  is very_good_for phones in the sub  20 range  on ear headphones bought two red pairs and one blue  the red pairs have been really durable for two young boys and they work great  the blue pair for whatever reason only one side works and that was with 48 hours hence the reduction in stars  i_like the build of these headphones i_like the build of these headphones  4 stars because there is an issue with connecting them to a 3 5mm to 6 5mm stereo adapter   the talk button must be engaged to achieve full audio fidelity since these are 4 ring and not 3 ring  so_if you are using them with a stereo adapter you will have to put a binder clip on the talk button and tape it down  fine for plugging into mobile devices  though  nice for the_price these really are great headphones  the sound is very clear and i_loved that they came_in colors   i_got the blue ones  only one minor problem  they are a_little tight on my head  but for the_price  i_m satisfied_with this_product and would recommend it to others  love the look and feel but when i_tried it     love the look and feel but when i_tried it in my kindle for an audible book it didn_t_work better_than_expected the sound quality is so_much better_than_expected  i_can actually fold them down to fit in a pocket  cord is durable and long  which is a_good thing  i only wish they fit a_little more snug  as_i_m usually pretty active while wearing them  they ve slipped off a_couple_of_times  the on off vol button is easy_to_get a feel for  excellent customer_service the sound quality is pretty_good  but the transition from the black plastic to foam has uncomfortable plastic corners that sometimes dig into your skin when you rest the headphones on your neck  the left audio stopped working after minimal use  but the_seller was very accommodating and immediately offered a replacement  the_quality of the headphones is pretty_good given their price  but the customer_service that comes_with them is excellent  you only get what you pay_for  the headphones are good enough for my purposes  but i wish they were better at canceling out the_background noise i usually use them when watching a movie on my laptop  for my grandson i just gave them to him for his 7th birthday  he is very hard on earphones so_if these last i will give them a five star rating  he loved them the_price was very_good it was a valentinesday gift for my husband to_replace his broken ones  he loved them the_price was very_good  awesome    kind of awesome   extremely fast_shipping  sounds good  but the volume control doesnt work  a_good_value haven_t used them extensively yet  but i_m pleased_with the sound quality and fit  i especially like that they fold up compactly for travel  sound quality is excellent sound quality is excellent compared to the_one that come_with cell phones  comfort  way more comfortable than ear buds  
  sounds nice  clear after using these for 3 months now  and with me getting constant emails about writing a review for this  here is basically what i think of the headphones  pros    sounds nice  clear  and crisp    the white headphones are beautiful  it s_not a boring dull white  but a_nice cool white  neutral    volume and mic does_not_work  never worked since day one  cons    after wearing the headphones for 2 hours  on volume 5 on my phone  my ears  not the inside but the outside  gets red and starts hurting a_lot  has been happening since day one    cushions of the headphones feel like they have nothing_in them  that it s just the fabric and barely any ear support    cushions are also very small  looks to be made with people who have small ears in mind really  conclusion  get these headphones if you have small ears  and don_t mind if the mic and volume control not_working  if you have average ears  your ears are most likely going_to_get uncomfortable with these headphones around the_same two hour mark  and i suggest looking at other headphones to_get  the sound was clear with any other headphones and they were comfortable_to wear when i_got these headphones  initially one_of the ear pieces was_not_working  but over time  it went away  they are also not completely folding compatible  the_way the bridge of the headphones is made prevents them from folding all the_way  the sound was clear with any other headphones and they were comfortable_to wear  but my ears did hurt after wearing them for long periods of_time  i had these headphones for three months until the part that connected the earpiece to the frame broke because they were simply made out_of plastic  be mindful of what you are going_to_get based on what you are paying for  i_decided to_buy a different set of headphones the second time  pretty colour beautiful colour  edgy  moves around  foldable  however a_little small for my ears so a_bit of discomfort after on for a long time  can give to my teen niece soon   the sound coming from them is nice  they are too big  i_dont consider myself to have an extremely small head  but they are big with no way to adjust them smaller  the sound coming from them is nice  not the right choice for me  i_m a_bit disappointed  the reviews were good_but i found them uncomfortable on my ears  maybe full size over ear headphones would have been a better choice for me   there was quite a_bit of static and the volume faded in and out when i_moved  mostly ok    fairly decent for the_price  the cord is a_bit short though  i_don_t care much for the volume control  very hard to manage  uncomfortable  weird proportions the band is too big  the pads ear pieces are too small and at a uncomfortable angle  all the pressure ends up on the top of my ear   the sounds seems okay  its a okay product  these are good_but they tend to skip songs or stop the song for no reason if_i accidently brush my finger against the ear jack on my phone or walk around and the cord swings  
don_t waste your time  i was originally very_happy_with my headphones  they had a quality sound with clarity  i_ve only had them for a_month  and there s a short in the cord  the sound fades in and out  they only give you a_month for returns  and i_ve had them for a_month and a_week  i_m very_disappointed  and feel that i_ve wasted my hard earned money  i will definitely not order from vogek again  poor sound  i_don_t understand how everyone can say these sound so great  even for a  15 00 pear of headphones  i have cheaper pears that sound way better  i find them to sound muffled not clear like the description reads  very_disappointed with these phones  i_love how these feel i_love how these feel  felt like premium headphones but didnt last as long as a snow cone  within 3 months one_of the ear pieces stopped working and by month 4 totally went bum  and i was_not a heavy user either used the headphones like one day weekly give and take  i_can live with the poor quality  the right speaker cuts in and out  i just wanted these to_use when surfing the web on my laptop  i_can live with the poor quality  two_stars nice set but only one side was working 
piece of junk the volume control does_not_work  also  no sound comes out_of the right earpiece  this item comes_without instructions  there is supposed to be a volume control  the_only_thing_i see that looks anything like a volume control is two buttons  one_of which has a plus sign and the_other a minus sign  i would think that the plus sign means increase the volume and the minus sign means decrease the volume  neither of these buttons has any effect on the volume  there is sound coming out_of the left earpiece but not the right earpiece  would not recommend  will not_buy_again very brittle  i knew it would break very soon  and it broke with some moderate pressure on the 3rd day  very cheap plastic  the designers of these headphones knew this  would not recommend  will not_buy_again  the good is that they look good_and the cord is of good quality   but it it breaks what good is it     would have been great if they hadn t broken so quickly  i_bought these based on the good reviews  they seemed great  really comfortable  but one_of the ear pads broke off within a_week  i_don_t expect  15 headphones to last forever  but a_week  come on  broke after 9 days    these headphones arrived april 19  it is now april 28   the plug broke off inside the tablet  lasted only 9 days     cant get the plug part out_of the tablet  not happy 
4 year durability and comfort fit tests if you re looking_for a testament on durability  reliability  and fit  here s my experience with these earphones  durability and reliability test   passed   four years of daily use and still functioning  been using this since 2012 during the day while i work to listen to music  these are the_only earphones i_use that do have not an in line microphone because_it is_not needed for my office work  this gets rolled and tossed into my bag every weekday  yet   no tears  no loose wires  earpads in tact  fully functioning  sound still crisp and clear  it can definitely stand the mild abuse  comfort test   passed  the fit is perfect_for my ears   very ergonomic as the bud rests nicely in the concha  bowl shaped cavity  of the ear  cradled by the intertragal notch   like a snug hug  the earpads insert easily into place for a gentle cushioned feel  loosely  locking  into place very naturally  i_ve worn these for hours at a time without any aching of the ear or hint of tension so the comfort is definitely there  i have also used them while walking  running  cleaning  and they rarely fall out   thank goodness  it s so bloody annoying when earbuds slip out  sound test   passed  let s be real  don_t expect sennheiser quality audio on a earphone that costs less_than popcorn at the movie theaters  but also don_t brush it off either  the sound quality is rather good  to the average user  one most likely won_t pick up the nuiances between amazing full bass  mid  or treble  these are definitely not bass enhanced so don_t expect these to pump out your favorite bass powered beats to your liking  but they will do an acceptable job at nice highs and clear mids  general notes  because of the fit of the earpad into the ear canal  it does block out some noise  because_i_do use these for work  i normally just keep one_of these earbuds in for the music while still being attentive within the environment  these earphones also do a decent job at keeping the audio  localized   meaning if you are jamming music at full blast  the sound will leak from the earphones  but not too much  i_can be listening to music at a somewhat loud scale and no one around me can hear it at_all  comfort fit comparison  i am an android user and faithful samsung galaxy series smart phone user  i have the old samsung galaxy s2 earphones and the new samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones to compare comfort ergo fit to  you ll see in my picture the stark difference in overall shape of the earbud from just three earphones  yet despite my loyalty to samsung galaxy smartphones  the fit of their earphones are always terrible  even the latest s6 edge earphone accessory  here is why the fit and comfort of the humble panasonic make my ears happier than most earpieces    see samsung galaxy s2 earphones  nice soft silicone gel earpad but poor earbud shape that doesn_t  lock  into place with the natural shape of the outer ear  thus  it frequently comes out like a loose  thick q tip    see samsung galaxy s6 edge earphones  better quality silicone gel earpad that attempts to cushion the supposed natural shape of the ear canal entrance  but utterly fails for anyone with normal sized ears  even with the smallest size gel earpads  the earphones frequently pop out and is very annoying  not only that  the gel earpads frequently loosen from the buds itself and falls off  i_got my s6 edge summer of 2015 and i have already used all spare gel earpads   another set of replacement earpads  if you look closely at the photo  i had to resort to a left earpad for my right earbud because_i had no more replacement earpads to_use   i am now down to a single earpad and am giving up on these stupid earphones in general  verdict  worth  four years on a product that works on a daily and fits great_for price of  6  10  no brainer  incredibly reliable and good quality  just buy these  seriously i am at work  next to the window  and there is a literal jackhammer outside the window  i have these headphones in  listening to music  and i_can_t hear it at_all  if you want that in your life  these are the earbuds for you  shocked by how good these are  i have a self appointed mission of finding inexpensive headphones that sound better_than average  i have been on this quest for years as_i am always never without my mp3 player or radio  i am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly  so_i am always trying_to find inexpensive headphones that sound better_than my previous set  skullcandy ink d   this time  after carefully reading reviews  i_purchased 3 different headphones at once  all_in the_same price range  under  15 00   the panasonic rp hje120 a  blue   the skullcandy jib  and the 2xl spoke  bounty hunter collection   my conclusions were that the 2xl spoke were adequate  but a distant third place  while the 2xl had definitively better bass than the skullcandy ink d  the 2xl s mids and highs were only adequate  the skullcandy jib completely blew the scullcandy ink d away  with much better bass  mids and highs  i_thought i found what i had been looking_for  that my quest had ended  but there was still the panasonic rp hje120 to listen to  i_must say i had little expectation for these after listening to the skullcandy jib s  but what was this  immediately the panasonic s sounded impressive  after listening to them for a while  i listened to the jib s again  i honestly preferred the cleaner sound of the panasonic rp hje120  and the ergo design was a plus  the fit was just so comfortable  so there you have my layman s evaluation of these three headsets and my hands down recommendation for the panasonic rp hje120  i_got the blue  however  i_very much doubt that your color choice will affect the sound   i hope this helped  must be fitted properly to hear bass frequencies if you ve been wondering how such a highly rated product like this can also have one_star reviews stating these earbuds have  absolutely no bass whatsoever  and sound  horribly tinny   i_d like to offer an explanation  these panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds  if that s how you wear them  you ll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume  think 1960 s pocket transistor radio   these earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear  forming an airtight seal  if you choose too small_of an earpad and or don_t push them in far enough  you won_t hear any low end frequencies  it s only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full range sound and volume  here s a quick analogy  tightly plug both ears with your fingers  close your mouth  and hum the lowest note you can  now take your fingers away  and notice how almost all_of the low end and volume drops out  that s the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds  although the acoustic principles are different  these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum  otherwise they ll sound horrendous  unfortunately  panasonic wasn_t very forthcoming on their product s packaging about how to wear the earbuds  and i_m certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs  as an audio engineer  i_can assure you these earbuds  when properly fitted  sound great  they re not audiophile quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a  200 pair of studio reference headphones  and they re not as ergonomic as a  150 pair of westones  but for the_price  they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain    arguably one_of the_best product bargains i_ve ever run across on_amazon  do they have a_lot of bass  they re not deficient in any of the low frequencies  but they re not bass enhanced earbuds  either  which some of you may be used to  they have a relatively nice  flat bass response as_is  but if you want extra bottom end on your music  you ll want_to boost the low end of your mp3 player s eq  fortunately  boosted lows  even the deepest of lows  are handled very_well by these panasonics  as a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn  they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of_time  the earpads are very soft and pliable  though  and i personally don_t experience any discomfort wearing them  since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear  there are two unique  negative issues to point out  1  be very careful not to drop your mp3 player  because having earbuds ripped out_of your ear canal is_not a pleasant experience  2  these earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it s racing during an intense workout  the incessant  tick tick tick  is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you re listening to  in summary  the audio quality of these earbuds  when properly fitted  will satisfy 99 9  of the general population  i would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise  but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while  these panasonics are an_excellent choice and a phenomenal value  these are fantastic  compared to many other earbuds that i_ve had that cost  75   100   150    these sound as_good as any of them  i_m astounded  i_use these for running and i_ve attached them to my sunglasses along with my ipod shuffle  i figured for  8  i could afford to sweat up a_few of these and replace them whenever i_needed to  i_ve run 1 500 miles with these in the last year and a half   i_ve gone through 4 pairs of new balance shoes  2 ipod shuffles  3 pairs of sunglasses and am on the_same set of earbuds   and  they still sound great  see my picture of the earbuds on my sunglasses  pretty dorky  but hey  they work great_and they stay in my ears too  they could survive the apocalypse alrighty  so here s what s gone down with these earbuds since_i_got them a year and a half ago  after losing i_can_t remember what happened to them these same pair of earbuds that i had had for a year  i_bought the exact same ones  and they re the_ones i have now  i have washed this pair twice  lost them in my college s attic while doing a service project  tearing apart mattresses and separating the materials for recycling  where they were almost thrown away and so covered in dust that i had to wash them  and recently i accidentally let the plug part and one_of the earbuds hang out_of my car while driving on the highway in torrential rain   the plug was ground into the pavement and is now lopsided looking  but  i tell you  they still freaking work  after all the craziness  granted  the left bud is sometimes a_bit on the fritz  but if_i just unplug and replug the cord it works again  the_only reason i_m back and writing a review is because_i_m about to purchase my third pair  the lopsided plug has a habit of sliding out and pausing whatever i_m listening to because of the loss of the nobbly part at the tip  going running i_can_t believe these are so cheap  these sound fantastic  i_mean i_can feel myself getting fitter and more productive already  i put on a  running  song to try out the_quality and i immediately wanted to_go running  i_don_t really run  at least i haven_t in a while  i think i_ll go now  or maybe i_ll clean the house   something that involves moving  i_got purple cause every color is a slightly different price_and they were one_of the cheapest  i actually ended up liking the color  it comes_with 3 different size rubber tips to fit your size ears  buy these    trust me    you re welcome  there were 32 000  verified purchases on this set of earbuds  and at the low  low price of  7 96  i figured if they weren t any good  well  it wasn_t the end of the world  these are replacing a set of bose earbuds that i_ve had for a_couple_of years  but they just wore out  i_m not going_to pretend that panasonic and bose are in the_same realm of sound quality  i will make the argument these are a better set of earbuds if you don_t need complete reproduction of the sound  first of all  these are way more comfortable than my bose  they fit in my ear better  the bose had the advantage of three point contact inside my ear  whereas the panasonic simply goes into the ear canal  but  the panasonic is softer and gentler inside my ear  second of all  the panasonic does a superior job of blocking outside noise  the bose was_advertised as  noise reducing  and they weren t very_good on that point  however  i always dismissed that because of the_quality of sound reproduction  the panasonic reduces noise enough_to where my wife can watch the tv at normal volume  and i_can be in the_same room streaming amazon video on my tablet and not hear the tv at_all  and that s without cranking up the volume  third of all  despite not being bose  these little earbuds do an amazing job at sound reproduction  i will state that 99 9  of the_time_i_use these earbuds to stream netflix or amazon video  i_can hear everything clearly  i get a_good feeling of  action  scenes  things blowing up  etc   i_don_t have a thing_in the world to complain about as far as sound quality  however  i_m also not playing music through them  these little eight buck earbuds are pretty awesome  and i_m happy_with my purchase  i_ve had these for over a year  i_ve had these for over a year  i_bought a set of these and a set of jvc hafx at the_same time  my first impression of these on my ipod 3 was  damn they re shrill  but then i remembered my wife used my ipod when she went for her walk the day before so_i adjusted the treble and these sounded pretty_good  then i took them out and plugged in the jvc buds  my first impression was damn they re shrill  i checked the settings and turned the treble most of the_way down  on the_same song  cannonball by supertramp  and listened to the whole song  every time the cymbals were hit  it felt like they were the main instrument in the band  even when i turned the treble off  midrange down and the bass up  they were still shrill  so_i kept the panasonic ergofit earbuds and put the jvc s in a drawer in case of emergency but it would have to be an extreme emergency  just to be sure  i_bought my wife a pair in grey so she can lie in bed at night and listen to a movie on her ipad  that way if mine ever break  um  babe  take these jvc buds  you ll love them and i_m sure she will because she loves extreme treble  but really these are the_best on_amazon  i_bought skullcandy  they lasted a_month because when i take mine off  i wrap them around my ipod and toss them onto the floor where the charger is  and yet with both my wife and i abusing the_same pair  turning the ipod all the_way to 100  all the_time_and me tossing them on the floor  these have lasted me over a year  i actually bought this pair dec 12th 2004  i_love them so_much that i_m going_to_get a set with the microphone because we just bought a smartphone so_i_m getting a 128 gb card_and putting all the music on there so_i_can ditch the ipod and free up some pocket room  solid earbuds for the_price  these earbuds are really great  i_ve bounced around from a_lot of different types  sizes  shapes  and colors  the actually buds of these are very small  which allows them to_go fairly deep into your ear canal  this is good_for multiple reasons such as filtering out noise   better bass  these are pretty lightweight also  which makes them nice to_use while you re on a walk or on a long road trip  let s get to the sound now   the sound is_nothing mind blowing  but it hits all the right areas  the volume gets loud enough  the bass is acceptable  these are   15 earbuds so let s_not expect miracles   and the overall quality of the pitches tones is very_good  i_m not an audiophile by any means  but i_can properly enjoy my music without any hassle  the_quality on these earbuds are pretty_good as_well  everything_is of sturdy construction and doesn_t have any weird creaking from weak material  yes  i_ve owned earbuds that have actually had this   the wires are thick enough_to give you the confidence that they will last without needlessly increasing the weight  the earpads come in three sizes  small  medium  and large   they re comfortable and aren t a pain to have in your ears for hours like other ones could be  the volume control buttons are plastic y with a  slightly  less_than decent  click  when using them  but this is nitpicking  they work fine_and are good enough  the microphone   this is probably the weakest part of this  the sound quality when speaking isn_t the_best for people on the_other side  no one has said it s unintelligible  but it can get a_bit garbled  not a huge issue to me  but you should note this if this is going_to be used primarily to talk to people  overall  a_very solid set of earbuds for the_price  again  this a is a 5 star rating for   15 earbuds  at this price point  i have no problem letting small things slip as mentioned above  well_worth the_money  i highly_recommend these  fit loosely but don_t fall out i_used these every day for over a year   with not so gentle usage   before one side stopped working  normally  a set of earbuds only lasts me a_few months  these have decent sound  but i especially like that they fit loosely in the ear without falling out or compacting earwax   my daughter crocheted over these and gave them to me for mother s day in 2015  for the_first time  i had no trouble with lost earbuds or tangled wires   easily the_best  cheap  earbuds around  these earbuds are amazing and for under  10   you cannot go wrong here  these earbuds have high ratings for a reason  i wasn_t sure how awesome these were going_to be when i_ordered them  judging from the reviews  i figured they would be good_but they blew my mind  these are fantastic  and for this price  i_don_t imagine you could get much better  they have a_nice clear and crisp sound with some really really nice bass  i will put it to you this way   if you are a dubstep fan  you probably know bass cannon by flux pavilion   they can handle it    that song has some really loud parts and strong bass sections  the earbuds don_t crackle or distort  they give really nice sound  i was listening to it at about 75  volume and it was super loud and super crisp  no reason to turn it up any louder  another song with really nice underlying bass is afterglow by phaeleh  and for those that know_it  you know what i_m talking about and these headphones make it sound phenomenal  not to mention they do a pretty_good job and blocking out ambient noise  some key features of these earbuds are  they are lightweight  have an ergofit design  come in lots of colors  and they feature a 3 6ft cord  one negative thing_i would have to_say is about the cord   it tangles very_easy  but most earbuds do tangle so_it s_not worth knocking a star off in my opinion  when you buy these earbuds  you will receive the buds with three included sets of earpads  s m l  for a custom  and comfortable fit  make sure you try all three while listening to music  pick the_one that makes the music sound the_best to your ears  the better you can hear the better the fit is  so_i_ve found  i originally thought i would need_to_use the smallest ones  but the sound i could hear out_of the medium was better_than the sound from the small  meaning the small wasn_t fitting just right  so ultimately i_went with the medium  it is important that you spend some time choosing the right size because by picking the right size you maximize bass quality  i_use these headphones on my  running sunglasses  rig  picture attached  and they sound amazing and they don_t fall out while i walk  run  or bike  they were the perfect choice for me for this setup i have  for anyone who wants to try what i_ve done  i am using these sunglasses  rockbros polarized cycling glasses sports glasses sunglasses goggles   and an ipod shuffle 2gb  4th generation   overall the earbuds were perfect_for my needs  i_bought them mainly because they were so cheap and i figured if they get messed up while exercising it shouldn t be a huge deal  it s safe to_say they exceeding my expectations by a long shot and if you re on the fence about these for whatever reason  don_t be  they are fantastic little earbuds and you will not be disappointed with your purchase  if you have any questions about this_product  feel free to ask me and i will answer to the_best of my knowledge  and if this review was helpful to you  please consider leaving a positive rating  just click buy already  these little headphones are great  i put them in my ears the moment i_got them and did yardwork for three hours  they were perfectly comfortable and noise isolating  allowing the music to_play cleanly and loud enough_to overcome the lawnmower  the_only_thing_i_thought could use improvement  and for seven dollars it s still not that big a deal  was the cable is kind of flimsy  so_i took 20 minutes and splice the cable into some para cord shrink tubing and now they feel like  100 earbuds  the sound is a_little bassy  but very punchy and clear  perfect_for airline travel  great_for people with presidential ears who sweat like sylvester stallone_in a montage hey  im james brains with the brains report  and this is my video review of the panasonic rp hje120 k in ear headphones  i_bought these headphones because my family steals my headphones every chance they can get  and  if they dont getem  then i break them because_i_dont know how to have nice things  i only buy cheap headphones for the above reasons  why spend good money on something_i wont get to enjoy  i have had these headphones for almost ten months now_and have not had any issues  i_mainly wear them to listen to podcasts while running  biking  and walking  i run in all weather  and i sweat like sylvester stallone_in a rocky montage  this has_not caused the headphones to malfunction  despite my giant presidential ears  i also have not had any issues_with the headphones jostling loose  except for one time_in the spring when i ran in gale force winds  they did_not stay in no matter how hard i_tried  the sound is great_for podcasts  i rarely listen to music on them because_i_like to try to better myself as a person  and i_dont learn anything from people telling me about what they did up in da club or how theyre emotional  my biggest complaints are that the cords get all tangled when i stuff them in my pocket  one time  it took me ten minutes to_get them untangled  for the most part  its_not that big of an issue  my other complaint is that its hard to_see the r and l signifying the left and right  irrespectively  but  heres a_little pro tip  tie a_little knot in the cord by the right headphone and remember thats knot right  if you have any questions  please comment below  im here to help  awesome little bud i_bought these just because of the hype surrounding them  i own several pairs of headphones and earphones  when i first put these on and listened  i was unimpressed  but i_misjudged them  because after comparing them back to back with my sony mdrxb40ap  i found that the treble on the sony was actually a_bit too much  almost harsh  because when i put the panasonic back on  listening to the treble was like my ears were on soft comfy pillows  the mid range was more present on the panasonic than on the sony  and the bass was_good  however the sony beat the panasonic in that category  but honestly  it should  since the sony was about 6x more expensive  and it is literally called  extra bass   the clarity and definition was also better on the sony  but again  i would expect it to be for the_price  all_in all  the sound you re getting is_nothing to sneeze at  and for about  6  7  you really can_t get a better deal  these are worth it for the unique driver chamber and nozzle design alone  they really are an ergonomic fit  so  if you really don_t have money to spend  get these  and even if you have better earphones  but just wanna compare  these are a fun buy  and they come in great colors  i_m glad i_got mine in red  i would ve gotten blue  but blue is just so    not red  y know  great ear buds but beware of gadget cases see photo  one reviewer here actually had a negative review and they were right  if your gadget is inside a case   and that case s audio hole is too small   you are hosed  these will not_work  if they do fit your case  if applicable  then you are home free  these by far are the_best  bang for the buck  ear buds i_ve ever purchased  they are both cheap and good  but i_can_t say it enough  there s a rectangular block of plastic at the end of these ear buds  where the audio prong is  mine just barely fit into my phone s case  i_tried_to include a ruler in the photo to help you measure yours  friends i kid you not  if that audio area in your case is smaller than the_one_in the photo   these won_t work for you  otherwise they are absolutely wonderful  panasonic earbuds for the longest time  i was purchasing cheap  non branded earbuds  the lifespan of these were not very long  either the headphone connection went bad or one_of the sides would short out  which started with this annoying crackle  by the_time_i added it all up  i was spending so_much i_might as_well pay_for a better pair  that s my stupidity  it s hard to believe how many types of earbuds there are  too many to choose from  out_of them all  i_decided on this pair  for the_price  i_can_t get over how well these panasonic earbuds sound  the sound is clear and there is just enough bass where it isn_t overbearing  in comparison to the cheaper pairs i was previously buying  the sound is 10 times better and doesn_t have that  tin can  effect  now  take note on this particular pair i am reviewing does_not have a built_in microphone nor volume control  but for my simple taste i_don_t need all that  if you do  i would try another model or brand  goodluck  my review revisited better_than_i first wrote  see my update  if you have a tin ear these might please you  tinny doesn_t_even begin to describe their sound  the crappiest headphones i have ever purchased  i read a review on cnet that these were great_and had great bass sound  nothing could be farther from the truth  they sound like music in a tin can  extremely bright treble crashes on your ear drums like clattering silverware on a marble floor  using the eq doesn_t help much at_all  don_t buy these unless you have no ear for quality sound and hate anything non treble  update  i have found that using the largest silicone cushions greatly enhances the_quality of sound  so_i have upgraded from one_star to five  the bass came forward way  way more when i_used the larger cushions  i should have remembered that from my last set of buds that used fitted silicone cushions  also  i put the buds in my ears according to their marked position which required a magnifying glass and strong light to_see on the_back_of each bud  panasonic needs to color in the l and r to be more visible  yes  these are much more comfortable than the apple earbuds  but not yet ready_to_say they sound better  i still feel they are too bright on treble  but i am way more happier with them now  well_worth the few bucks in comparison to apple s pricing  i_do miss the volume and pause controls  however  the sound is good  the fit is comfortable  the shipping is fast  and the_price is right  these earbuds are great  the earbuds are surprisingly comfortable  and produce a fantastic sound even when the volume is low  they drown out background sounds extremely well  even when i just have the buds in with no sound coming through  my office can get noisy  and sometimes its nice to mute it out  without having to counter it with more sound   the cord is the common plastic cord  nothing braided  wrapped  or fancy as with some other earbuds  so_i will be cautious when handling to reduce the occurance of accidental cord pinching  although the design seems a_bit odd at first glance  the fit is actually perfect  seriously  its perfect  and i have had no_issues_with them falling out as_im putting around with them in  it also came_with 2 other sizes of silicone caps for the earbuds if the_first ones arent a match for everyone else  the color is fun and keeps them from getting lost in the sea of black and white cords  so many cords    it comes_with a built_in mic  a personal must have  and from what ive tested so_far  it picks up sounds with crystal clear clarity  it doesnt have volume control  as some other ones do  but thats_not a big deal for me  i really like these  the sound is good  the fit is comfortable  the shipping is fast  and the_price is right  excellent price to quality relationship after breaking another pair of earphones i had to_go through the process of choosing and getting a_new_one  i_did_not want_to spend a_lot but at the_same time didn_t want_to have them broken after less then few months  so_i_went to amazon and looked what the_best seller and amazon s suggestions are  in the beginning i was very skeptical about panasonic earphones  not only because of a low price  but also because_i never owned a pair of this brand  i whatsoever decided to order these to try them out  i am amazed by the_quality after having used them for half a year  they did_not go bad at_all  the sound quality is just_fine  none_of the strings broke  earbuds are soft and did_not get lost or disconnected and it fits great_with all_of my devices  the_only disadvantages are that since the strings are thin  they often get messy and that this set does_not have a microphone  however  having that said  it is still an incredible quality price relationship  i am fully satisfied_with my choice and strongly recommend these for people with small budget for earphones  great sound  noise isolation   fit  size  price these are the_best of the_best in ear headphones for the_price  and here is why  1  i have about 15 different headphones  some of them are very high end  and only reason i_bought these was_its size  i sleep on my side and_play something until i fall a sleep or listen an audio book  when you turn to side to fall a sleep with earbuds in your ears  you need really small ones that doesn_t protrude outside contours of ears  otherwise pillow presses to earbuds into your ear canal and it hurts  so these earbuds are so small and excellty fit  you can_turn to side and fall a sleep when they are in your ears  2  they sound fantastic when compared to peers like sony or apple or many other unknown chinese brands  music is crystal clear  and detailed  great bass  incredible sound staging  for this price it is a steal  after listening this  you wouldn_t put crappy apple earbuds again  as you can guess i_use an iphone as a source  3  i would never expect noise isolation from these buds  but anatomically it seals to ear canal very_well  key is silicon seals attached to an oval opening instead_of a circular one like many other earbuds  so_it fits better  when you listen music with these earbuds  it seals surrounding noise so well  you can_t hear a ringing office phone_in front of you  i compare this the benchmark active noise canceling bose quitecomfort 35 bluetooth headphones  and i own one  these little earbuds seals background noise nearly as_good as bose  since they are very tiny and you can fall a sleep when these one_in your ears  so this 8  little earbuds are more convenient than 350  bose headphones  by all means bose sounds better  size always matters  4  price  only 8  incredible for this kind of sound quality  5  durability is unknown  since_i have been using only for a_month  but they are perfect  mic sounds good   audio sounds good   right angled jack is ideal for smart phones great microphone  great audio  and right angle jack makes phone more pocket friendly  i have bought sooo many  official approved  apple earpods  and they all break  mostly because when i put my phone_in my front pocket and then sit down  the cable juts out from the phone_in a straight line  and eventually it wears out  so that signal starts cutting out to one_of the ears  or the microphone fails  and i_ve tried_to_buy knock offs  and those sound terrible  or their mics are awful  today  i_received this panasonic ergofit  i_ve tested the sound and the microphone  both are excellent  for this price   and  best of all  the right angled jack means that now my phone will sit easier in my pocket  and the cable will be less likely to_get damaged  i_m hoping these last a long time  if you re looking_for an affordable set of ear buds that sound good  have a_good microphone for calls dictation  and a right angle jack  i heartily recommend this  and i_m someone who  rarely  writes reviews  i never review items   these are freaking awesome i_ll keep this short  these headphones sound amazing for less_than 10 bucks  i_purchased them in july of 2016   i wasn_t at_all familiar with panasonic products  just read everyone s reviews  the current pair that i have in my ears have to have over 1 000 sweaty miles of running on them  honestly  i_ve sweat  and ran over 1 000 miles in these headphones  i just finished my second marathon  and these suckers have been in my pocket in nearly 40 states  i wear them every single day   and i_m dreading the day when i have to_get the i phone 7   because_i_ll have to_use bluetooth headphones  and i hate that  again  i rarely rave about products on_amazon  but these simply are phenomenal  there s a reason they have 42 000 five star reviews  keep up the good work panasonic  i_ll never own another pair of headphones  great little earbuds for the_price great sound for a cheap set of earbud headphones  really can_t complain for the_price  the mic on the line with a button to mute end calls works wonderfully  as_well as the voice quality as reported by people on the_other end  cons  the cord has developed a permanent twist and can_tangle easily but hardly a complaint for  9 headphones  especially with the_quality of sound you might find in  65 equivalent  construction could be better  fairly low grade plastic and thin leads to the earbuds  but the minijack connector is angled  sturdy  and compact  again  not bad for the_price  the dark horse you know how there are so many headphone brand names that you sometimes forget about the really inexpensive  cheap looking ones because you don_t believe that they would ever compare  yeah  i totally underestimated the panasonic rphje120v in ear headphones  holy s     let me tell you  for  7 49  you can have a wonderful in ear headphone experience with these suckers  although the violet didn_t look like the picture  it s no reason to_take a star away from these cute earphones  with every in ear headphone  it is crucial to find which set of earbuds properly fit your ear  these earphones came_with three different sizes  similar to some other earphones that i have  these specific earphones have a circular structure  but an oval like design  thus  they are supposed to fit snuggly into your ear and they are supposed to literally fully plug your ears to reach their maximum potentially  please keep that in mind when you are trying_to by in ear headphones  i learned after buying  returning  and losing a_few earbuds  as_i never had a chance  or gave them a chance  to test the earbuds out out_of my laziness  these earphones are comfortable  have a_very impressive sound  and music can be clearly heard  i listened to a_few intense piano pieces to quiet ones  and also listened to wu tang and then some frank sinatra after  lol  i_m not disappointed by these and i_don_t think i ever will  i consider this a dark horse because panasonic may not be bose  sennheiser  audio technica  or any other high quality brand  but these will sweep you away if you just let them  does it s job well  bought from seller  amazon com llc  and have been using this item for half a year now  needed an earpiece with a mic since_i_needed to_use my hands often whenever people call me  i haven_t personally heard that the mic sounds like on the_other end  but i_m told it works pretty well  even in the car on the highway  my girlfriend said she didn_t_even notice i was_in the car when we talked  also  i_ve accidentally tugged on wires numerous times and it still works_perfectly fine_and when i store it  i_like to knot is to keep it from getting tangled and just throw it in my bag pocket   i_ve attached a picture  it also comes_with 2 extra pairs of earbud tips in case you need one smaller or bigger than the_one_it comes_with   or if you lose one   would recommend for anybody looking_for a cheap headset with a mic and isn_t picky about crystal clear audio  i_thought they were pretty_good  but these are better for years  i_ve been using a pair of samsung buds that came_with my s3  i_thought they were pretty_good  but these are better  the sound quality is very_good  my laptop has always had a_very pronounced hiss over my s3 headphones  with these  the hiss is much less pronounced  obviously they won_t be able_to duplicate bass the_way larger speakers can  but because they seal the ear canal they actually do a pretty_good job with the bass  producing a_very_nice_and even sound  comfort is also very_good  they come_with three different sizes of rubber cushions  and the shape of the earbuds very_nice  it s lower profile than my samsungs and it also conforms more to the shape of the ear  helping to keep them from falling out  the_way they seal the ear canal also provides a_little attenuation of background noise  you couldn_t use them as ear protection when shooting a gun or anything like that  but they help a_little with background noise and such  all_in all  very_happy customer  great quality product  and highly_recommended  i was so upset at my hubby when i asked for headphones with in line control  and he ended up ordering these  not only did they not have in line control  but they were also that funny shape  which i_ve always hated  i put all three pairs he bought me into a drawer  and walked away from them  then  months later  my last pair of  good  headphones finally broke  and i was desperate enough_to pull one_of these out  protesting the entire time  it took only a_few uses to convince me otherwise  they are some of the_best headphones i_ve ever owned  the  funny  shape makes them so comfortable in my ear  the sound quality is amazing  and i have been using the_same pair for months now  without them going bad  i will order more of these when the_time comes  and get extras to give out to family members  great quality product  and highly_recommended   5 50 or  105 50 these sound awesome  i have quite a collection of headsets both earbuds and over the ear full sized cans from inexpensive skull candy to higher end shure in ear monitors  bose over ear and v moda crossfade m100s and these little baby s hold their own against them all  surprising bass and decent separation and i_got a green pair for like  5 50 or some crazy low price  unbelievable  if for nothing else grab a set just to throw in the consol of your car for emergencies  update  so my shure iem s finally failed on me  i lost the left channel so_i started using these as my go to buds and i_m still blown away with their stellar sound  i feel no need_to_replace my high end earbuds because these do the job very_nicely  one thing_i_ve noticed now that i_use them daily for hours on end is they fit very comfortably  more so than any other earbuds i_ve used in the past and they stay put very_well  again  better_than any other earbuds i_ve used  you simply can_t go wrong with a set of these  i_m buying up a_few more sets as backup_and to give out to friends and family  good_for the_price  no regrets durability 5 5  bought these almost 4 years ago and they have lasted me extremely well  i had a pair of samsung earbuds that came_with my phone about 3 years ago and they eventually died about 2 1 2 years after regular usage  these earbuds  however  are very hardy and durable  i wrap them up a_little too tightly  i admit  and there is absolutely no sign of wear and tear on the cord  the in ear part is also very sturdy  taking a reasonable amount of jostling  and so_far_so_good  model 3 5  it did take a_lot of getting used going from the old  traditional earbuds to the in ear style  i have terrible sinuses and so_i will never truly get over how they suction into your ear  and when they get ripped out after having a_good suction   awful     because of the in ear  suctiony ness  you will also get cord noise  as_in  every time that you touch the cord or it rubs up against something  it will be very obvious and amplified  this is unpleasant until you get used to ignoring it  all_of these things seem less about quality  and more just about getting used to this kind of earbud  sound 5 5  i_m not an audiophile by any means  but these earbuds have a really strong bass kick  quite good sound for the_price    not tinny at_all  not muted at_all  not scratchy at_all  i_m very impressed with the audio that these cheap little things can push out     edit  compared to higher end over the head headphones  i_can_tell that the bass is definitely boosted and the mids to highs are diminished  however  the overall sound is still clear  it s crystal clear sound  but with heavy base and the absence of some higher tones  you won_t notice that the highs and some mids are missing unless you re listening to stuff with heavier emphasis on those registers  but if you re really into strong bass  these will definitely do the job  comfort 4 5  once you get used to the in ear aspect  these are actual pretty comfortable  i ended up taking the rubber ends off and putting on different ones that fit into my ear better  however  the actual shape of the earbud  being slightly angled  allows it to rest in the ear quite comfortably  just don_t lay on your side with your ear squished into the pillow or that will be uncomfortable really fast  overall  5 5  i won_t take off stars for my discomfort due to_going inside the ear canal and then suctioning there because that is just how this kind of earbud works  good fit   good sound panasonic ergofit in ear earbuds headphones with mic controller rp tcm125 k  black  is great  these fit well in the ears and are very soft and comfortable  as you know good fit   good sound    fit is important    these fit well  cord is a comfortable size and convenient    not one_of those short cords that can be annoying  microphone works_well  sound is great    crystal clear sound even while on a_new york city subway  which is loud   for the_price point these will blow you away  of course  they are not the_quality of the_ones that cost hundreds of dollars   seems strong and durable  exceeded expectations and highly_recommend still the_best in class  still the_best  i am an audiophile jerk who loves accurate  clear sound  i enjoy pop  but usually classical music and opera are my thing  most inexpensive headphones are colored with way too much bass and otherwise  don_t have the volume of a timid mouse  sometimes thin  sometimes tinny  sometimes anemic  or all_of the above  for ten bucks  these are the richest sounding in the ear headphones i have ever owned  i_use these with my google pixel and the nt app which offers fantastic eq  imaging  volume  and detailed reproduction of even the most delicate passages  and  i am a clutz  i have gotten in the car and drive for miles with these puppies dragging on the pavement  they still work perfectly  m french bulldog has played with them  and i have slept on them  stepped on them  and had them out in the rain  takes a licking  and keeps on ticking  highly_recommend  while your are at it  buy a dozen  perfect fit for all earphones always seem to fall out because my ears are small  these come_with three different sizes  of course i_use the smallest  turns out our newest puppy also prefers them so after she carefully took each one_off and chewed them to bits  i_used the next size ear pads  these fit well but i still prefer the smallest because they stay in snug while i listen to music  to fall asleep and don_t usually fall out  our puppy doesn_t discriminate  she loved this size so_much she caused a_little damage to the cords that couldn_t be paired  i immediately ordered a_new pair and used my husband s iphone 7 earphones   yuck   iphone anything_is overrated and horrific quality   i_didn_t have to worry about that for too long anyways because the puppy feels exactly_as_i_do and ripped those to shreds  she is now my favorite dog   her name is siri and even she hates the iphone earphones  these panasonic earphones can handle bass  any volume  the mic for calls works better_than others as_well  no one can_tell they are on my headset or hear background noise like wind blowing  noisy kids and naughty puppies  yes  i put my earphones away or up high so she couldn_t reach them  she s more intelligent and better looking than most people  she even got that silly iphone case open to eat those earphones  siri_knows it all     my dog  not the iphone ai  i_m impressed  i_m a_bit of a stickler for audio  but am not fortunate enough_to_buy a pair of headphones without selling those i_used before it  so headphones breaking is a devastating outcome for someone such as me  when they do though  you re forced to the budget market  now  i_don_t like iem s  but these deliver  especially for the_price  now  the_quality of the build isn_t anything particularly satisfying to feel or look at  but i_m someone who fiddles with things  i_ve become accustomed to swinging the earbuds  and despite the several times i_ve smacked these on the ground or even stepped on these  they refuse to break  a big problem i have with iem s are comfort  i find sticking something_in my ear really kind of gross  you could imagine that the design of these would be an instant turn off  as they re designed to literally go into your ear canal  didn_t matter  i_used the smallest size pads and stuck them in  for 30 minutes i could have them in and feel no discomfort  which is crazy for iem s  i_m happy_with the comfort of these for what they are  but don_t expect to want_to have them on for over an hour  i_ve tried_to divide this into sections of build  comfort  features and sound  but these really don_t have any features  regularly this would be a degradation  but they don_t need_to  they don_t have multimedia controls  which was a_bit saddening  but the sound quality makes up for that  now  the sound quality is what really surprised me  the panasonics are bass heavy  and they re not very refined  however  it s_not overbearing or boomy  which makes me okay with it  the bass is enjoyable  it can excite you  the mids are definitely the mid range and low mid range is really where these things shined  the clarity and separation still surprise me at times  and in a_good way  the highs are rolled off a_little too soon for my liking  but they aren t sibilant  and they re audible  the audio is enjoyable at_all frequencies  another things that surprised me about the audio was the soundstage  which was surprisingly large for something literally inside of your head  larger than the m50x s at least  and some low end bose headphones  definitely worth the 10 dollars just for that  the imaging is lackluster  but they can_t all be winners  it s just not immersive enough  then again  i_m using these on the go for school and the bus  i_can imagine people talking literally inches away from my ears would make for a rather grounding experience  noise cancellation is solid  not much to_say there  passive  it s good  isolation really surprised me though  using it in a classroom i_can have my music cranked up to max  too loud for my ears  and no one could possibly hear me  great  worth ten bucks  worth 25  arguably worth 40 50  buy them if you need them  and you wont be disappointed  much better sound than anticipated bottomline  great stuff for the_money  good sound  not super sturdy looking but can_t complain  i really needed a_new pair  given that my previous earbuds  jlab  broke a_couple days ago after 2 years of constant use  i was hesitant about these  the reviews  although mostly positive  also showed some troubling sights  poor quality  easy_to break  etc  i_cancelled the_purchase 3 hours after ordering because the reviews did_not promise good results  but after some more searching  i realized these were my best option for the_price  so_i bit the bullet  yes  the cable seems thin  yes  the shape looks weird on the picture  but in person they are quite comfortable  if you use the smallest rubber piece  these don_t come_with those  but i had a spare from my dead earbuds  the sound is full  has plenty_of bass  and doesn_t fall particularly flat  definitely a_good_purchase for the_price  i will update in a_couple_of months  and see how well they hold up with daily use  comfy  this is by far the most comfortable earbud i have ever used  i hate earbuds  they are painful or bothersome to me at_all times  even when i swap out the rubber thingies to change the  size   a certain company named after a fruit have the worst ever  how do people even wear those  ugh  i_bought these because some other reviewer said they were comfortable  they are  i barely notice i have them in  with other brands  skullcandy  etc  i always have to stop and take it out a while because of discomfort  these i could wear all day and never touch  sound  whatever  i_can hear my playlists in my office just_fine  i_m not a sound quality snob  so_i really can_t comment on the ins and outs of the sound quality  can i hear my music  yes  do they feel like house slippers for my ear  yes  i_m ordering about 5 more to_replace all my current pairs of painful brands  if you have a picky ear  and you aren t a sound snob  get them  best buy_for the_price  don_t spend more_than you need_to on in ear earbuds  for the_price  are you kidding me  don_t expect audiophile levels of quality from these earbuds  but if your looking_for something to produce noises in your ear and are equally concerned with the_price as the_quality these are the perfect middle ground  i have purchased far more expensive headphones that ve produced a relatively equivalent level of audio quality  i_don_t use these to listen to music often  and wouldn_t really recommend in ear earbuds to_do so  instead  i_use them to watch films and videos  or listen to audiobooks and podcasts  via my phone  as a product to meet those needs  the_price point and quality of these really can_t be beat  i_can_t recommend these enough  especially given the fussy nature of earbuds  i_don_t think its justifiable spending a price several times higher for quality a fraction better_than these  knowing that_eventually the earbuds will just stop working anyway  these are as_well built as earbuds i_ve bought that cost more_than 10x the_price  i fully expect these to break like those did  but its a_lot easier to justify spending less_than 10  when that happens than_it was to spend over 100   great sound and fit these are the_best headphones i have bought and i have bought tons of them  you know how things have changed and is hard to find a_good_product that it does_not cost you an arm and a leg and works decently  these headphones are great  great sound  good fitting  i_use them on the bicycle or when i lay down to listen to meditation music  they stay on i_dont have to worry the wind will knocked them out my ears or when i lay down on bed  even when i_move around they stay on    i have bought a_few but always wait when they are on sale  the_first one_i_bought was only  7  when i came back to_buy another pair the_price was much higher  i have bought 4 and always check the_price_and buy more because like a haircut when you find someone who does your hair right you pray they live forever  i_bought a_few because_i have spent so_much money on headphones and spent top dollars and none satisfy me like these ones  wonderful headphones  perfect price  these are great headphones  truly superb  i_use them every night  you see  i_m a_bit of an insomniac  and my partner snores  loudly  deviated septum and denial about potential sleep apnea  we re working on it   if_i only wear earplugs  the thoughts in my head race and i will never fall asleep  not when there are so many things to think about and worry about and question     including  i kid you not  the fact that there are more_than four states of matter    and what would happen to matter at absolute zero   these are the things that keep me up at night  so_i listen to podcasts  soothing  calm  australian podcasts with the most lovely voices that i get so lost in i_can_t focus on the words     which puts me to sleep  sweet  blissful  sleep  except snorey mcsnorepants can_t sleep if_i play my podcasts in the room at large  and i_can_t sleep with snoring  these headphones have a low enough profile that i_can sleep on my side without hurting my absurdly sensitive ears  and they manage to block enough sound that on a_good night  i_don_t need earplugs  just headphones  on a bad night  i put one earplug in the ear facing up_and one headphone_in the ear on the pillow and i sleep beautifully  they re comfortable  they offer great sound quality  and they block sound better_than most headphones  at last  we can both get some sleep  usually  so_far_so_good  ok  i_ve only used these once  so_i_can_t comment on durability  i_can say that i have very small ears  and other earbuds hurt     my husband loves his earbuds  but to me they are torture devices  i_ve always been jealous of the fact that he is able_to_use pocket sized headphones  while i have to carry around big bulky over ear ones  i gave these a try because they come_with small  medium  and large ear plugs  i put on the small  of course  and for the_first time_i was able_to_use earbuds without pain  there s still kind of a strangeness to having something_in my ear  but they are comfortable enough that i am able_to enjoy my music or audiobooks while running or walking  i am not a sound geek at_all  so_i_can_t say how these compare to fancy schmancy sound systems  but i listened to a playlist of old favorite songs  and they sounded as_good as_i remember them  i listened to some of an audiobook and was able_to hear every word clearly  i am so happy to finally have pocket sized headphones of my own that i could cry tears of joy  a_great earbud option at an extremely reasonable cost  with great sound and a long life span  teens lose earbuds at an astronomical rate  i_m not_sure how it happens  as the earbuds are always plugged into their phones  and their phones never get lost   anyway  i_ve purchased earbuds of all brand and price levels  including a set of beats for my hubby  which did_not sound as great as_advertised  were too expensive and broke within a year of usage   anyhoo  these panasonics are fantastic  great sound  even better price  i have purchased 5 sets and keep them hidden from the family until there s an earbud emergency  as long as they re not lost  they last a long time   the set i_use are 2 years old and still kick out great sound  without any issues_with the cord  they re also comfortable in ear  they are not the round in ear cushion  but flat ish  they fit perfectly  these are a_great earbud option at an extremely reasonable under  10 cost  with great sound and a long life span  thanks panasonic  great cheap buds  i have several pairs for home and office  this is my cheap earbud of choice  in fact  i_ve bought about 8 pairs of these  don_t expect them to last more_than 6 months or so  but i lose things often enough or ruin them by my own accord that i never want_to spend more_than 10 bucks  i_ll get to the airport cursing my inevitable forgotten item  and then have bought these same headphones for triple the_price at hudson news  they come_with three sizes of squishy bits for inside your noggin  i tend to_use the biggest and find switching the bits very_easy  makes it nice for cleaning too  when these headphones do go  it is rarely the jack that is the_problem  6 out_of 7 times it s been one earpiece losing volume by about 50  making everything uneven  still  five_stars for the_price  you can_t get mad when you pay so so little  these are truly fantastic  these ear buds are easily every bit as_good as_described  i_m actually shocked at the_quality of the_product for such a small price tag  the sound is crisp and clear  the buds are comfortable_to place and don_t make my ears hurt after extended wear  many products do   i_ve had these for several months now  and with moderate use i_ve noticed no change in the_quality or the performance  i have an iphone 5s  and even with a case they fit into the jack well  my husband has a different case and they don_t fit quite as snugly  but he s still able_to_use them  in fact  my husband had a more expensive pair that he used daily  they stopped working a_few weeks ago so he asked to borrow mine  after one use he noted that these are better_than the more expensive ones he d previously used  he enjoyed them so_much he asked me to order a pair for him  i_ordered the blue ones  and they re a beautiful electric blue  the color is exactly_as pictured  the right and left are clearly labeled  the cord is an appropriate length to_use on phone  ipad  etc  the buds are clear and have stayed clean_and maintained their shape throughout hours of use  the_only small draw back is the lack of microphone  unable_to_use these to_make phone calls   that s_not really an issue for me  but it was the_one thing my husband said he liked more about his other pair  great_for the_price i_ve been using these for almost 5 months now  so we haven_t quite reached the six month death sentence that i usually have with earphones  and i_ll update my review should that happen  but so_far i_ve been enjoying them  and really impressed at how cheap it is  the sound quality is great  better_than the headphones i_bought for  30  fits comfortably in my ear  i_ve noticed it recently glitching  like how when earphones start nearing their end  and one ear keeps start stopping the sound with every move you make until it just stops  this doesn_t do that  at least not yet  instead_of the sound stopping  the volume is just lower  but i_don_t notice it all until maybe i shift and suddenly the volume is louder and i think  wait i was listening on low volume awhile ago   the_quality is good enough that it doesn_t sound that way lol  so at least the_way it glitches doesn_t annoy me  and isn_t noticeable  i_ll see how it holds up  these buds are grea      i reordered these as holiday stocking stuffers over 50k positive reviews for these panasonic earbuds     yup  they are good  definitely  not bose or jaybird full range sound quality but these affordably priced in air buds are a_great second pair for leaving in my desk drawer  what i_like most about these buds  the ear pieces are comfortably soft and actually do a_good job blocking out a_lot of outside noise  the sound quality is good     works for me listening to podcasts and when i just want some background music in my head    the buds fit in ear and stays there without slipping out  these panasonic buds are definitely value for your money     attractive too  see my photos in customer images i reordered these as stocking stuffers over the holidays     hope my review and photos were helpful     jeffrey a   jeff  worth every penny  great fit  tough as nails  reviewed years after purchase   still going strong these are better at noise cancelling than the_ones designed to_do that job and far less expensive  i beat them up mowing a large property and not once has a bud pulled loose from the earpiece  my motorcycle helmet has bluetooth speakers but if_i_m in a hurry i just use these and even in a snug helmet they work perfectly and i barely hear the external sounds  not exactly safe  but hey  it s all about the music and i am super watchful anyway   great job  great_value  i_m pleasantly surprised by these earbuds  i have tried a number of different sets that have been in the  30 and below range and so_far my favorite have been the creative ep 630 s  i_m not_sure why  but i always passed these up when looking_for new_ones to try  but based on the overwhelming positive reviews and the low cost i_decided to give them a shot  i_m glad i_did because to my ears these sound as_good or close to those ep 630 s  i probably need_to compare the two more but i_m thrilled in just the fact that i_can even say that much  the bass sounds great  it s deep with not much distortion and the mid and higher ranges sound good as_well  i found the fit to be good_and comfortable as_well  bearing in mind that i_do most of my music listening while lounging and not while doing some physical activities  but i would surely think they would stay in and work well for that too  these are a_great_product that are an incredible value and i have no qualms about recommending them to anybody that doesn_t need some crazy expensive audiophile level earbuds  very comfortable  incredible sound  especially for the_price  i am amazed at the bass these things put out  don_t get me wrong  they sound quite nice_and balanced otherwise  but they can handle bass like i couldn_t believe  they re not exactly audiophile grade in ear monitors  but for the_price  they re fantastic  my fellow amazonians steered me right on these  i_m tempted to grab another pair or two just in case my current pair breaks or gets lost  it was also completely worthwhile to grab one_of the little zip close protector cases  made by bluecell  on_amazon  as a bonus  they re literally the most comfortable earphones i_ve ever worn  i_got a pair for my girlfriend as_well  and she s now ruined for life when it comes to earphone sound quality  she used to be just_fine with the stock earphones that came_with whatever phone or music player she had  but not any more    earbuds that deliver i_ve purchased these earbuds six times  over the course of seven years  i_don_t play nice with my earbuds   they re almost constantly plugged into my phone  even when i_m not using them  i_know you re not supposed to wrap your earbuds around your phone  but that s really the_only way i store them  whoops   usually they break at the end of the wire  near the jack  there was once where the plastic part of the earbud itself popped out  i_m not especially picky about sound quality   i_can_tell when an audio file was ripped off youtube  but that s about it  i am  however  really picky about fit  most earbuds and headphones cause too much pressure in my ears and can make me feel nauseated  these earbuds fit comfortably and don_t cause any pressure  that s honestly the main reason why i_ve purchased these year after year  i_ve tried high end earbuds   30 100   and none_of them fit as comfortably as these  so long as_i_don_t find a better fitting earbud that promises greater durability for a reasonable price  i_ll continue paying my meager annual dues  thanks panasonic  don_t pay more  these are the_same headphones sold elsewhere for more  great headphones   i originally bought these as  yamaha  headphones and they were  30  i saw these on_amazon and they looked exactly the_same for a quarter of the_price  after testing them  i am certain they are exactly the_same product  they sound good  not great  but i_don_t need great_for what i_use them for  because they lie close to your ear  they are perfect_for sleeping in  i put my headphones in and_play some music to put me to sleep and they stay in my ears well_and i_can sleep on my side  because_i sleep with them  they will eventually fall apart  but these have survived very_well  they are already into the_first year  and they are still going strong  i should buy a_couple more pairs and throw away the dozens of other pairs i have laying around  by far the_best phones under  10 i have ever tried wow  i have purchased many headphones   dual driver  is the_way to_go for any phones over 25   others such as soul republic sl99  and beyer dynamics sound great but have some drawbacks for a price range over 35 99   with that said i have tried all kinds of phones in the 100  range  so lets forget price_for a moment  these are by far the_best phones under  10 i have ever tried  they are pretty much the_best i_ve tried under 25   once_i get into discontinued phones selling for 30  that used to sell for 70  100  these start to compare on that level  as with all single driver phones these may begin showing on the mid to high tones  but these are still pretty tight on the midtones at higher levels  they don_t fall out_of my ear  hold in the sound from background noise when inserted correctly and using the proper ear pieces given  are pretty lightweight as_well  cons  packaging is the old  blister style  pain in the butt to open  need a razor or strong scissors  they are not tangle free  i would like to_see panasonic make a 15  version with a larger driver  very comfy and durable   update july 2 2017  at some point  i ended up using these as my primary headphones  after adjusting to them  they are actually very comfortable  the_first several times i wore them  see my original review  below  they weren t that comfortable but i evidently didn_t give them enough of a chance  1  they are very comfortable_to wear even over long periods of_time  i_use them as my headphones for all day at work_and they don_t bother my ears  2  they stay in just_fine working  walking  etc  i haven_t tried them while jogging but i_ve yet to have much issue with them falling out or coming too loose  3  the sound is great_for the_price  it s_not  bose  or anything obviously  but the sound is much better_than my coby earbuds and roughly equivalent to my soundbot  in short  it s balanced and clear without sounding super bass y nor tinny  4  i_ve just learned today that they are very durable  i was looking all over for them and couldn_t find them so_i just used some other headphones and what do you know   i had tucked them in a shirt pocket and accidentally washed  and dried  them  i_thought for sure they were done for  the cable even felt a_little bit softer  but nope  i plugged them into my laptop and started up a_video and they still worked  they didn_t sound any different than before i washed    them  they were very tangled but i_can live with that  overall  i would highly_recommend these headphones now after giving them more of a chance myself  and  if you re like i was_initially  try giving your ears a_little more time to adjust  original review  november 2015   i read several reviews before buying these and got intrigued  my ears are small or shaped weird   especially my left one  i_don_t know what it is but i have never found ear buds comfortable  the original kind that have a hershey kiss speaker shape that goes in your ear   those are the worst  the soft in ear kind are significantly better  but still not comfortable_to me and they have a tendency to fall out  i prefer regular over the ear headphones but those aren t so acceptable at work  i_bought a pair of soundbot headphones that were super comfy  but after awhile the left side broke  it still works  but jiggling the wire pauses songs  skips songs  and even turns the volume up or down  which there isn_t actually a control on the headphones for   wanting to find a replacement  and not be locked in to one specific brand of style   i_tried these  for starters  they are cute  i_mean  for ear buds  the blue is a pretty blue  it is a_bit brighter than say  royal superman blue  also  they do actually stay in my ears pretty well  the ear piece sort of hooks into the shape of your ear in a similar manner as the soundbot ones  locking it in place  it isn_t stuck in there however  and still relies a_bit on the shove it in your ear factor  the cord is decently long  a comfortable length in my opinion  however  it is thin  i feel like it could easily have a similar problem within a_few months if_i_don_t take extra_good care of them  that said  there is no control for anything on these headphones so hopefully if_it started getting damaged  it would have no effect  the sound is very_good  especially for the_price  i have a pair of cheap  coby ear buds and the sound quality on those is_noticeably lower than any others i have tried   so these are better_than that  at least  these i would say are a notch below my soundbot headphones and a_few notches above the coby  i would say my soundbot headphones are about on par with my original galaxy s5 headphones for sound quality  if that helps  one thing_i_dislike is that i_can easily hear background noise through these headphones  it isn_t crystal clear  but in a noisy office  i find myself having to turn the volume up further  it isn_t to_say that they are supposed to have noise cancel  but i_got used to it with my galaxy s5 headphones and especially with my soundbot ones  galaxy s5 headphones block out the majority of background noise  and the soundbot ones block out all but the loudest  even without anything playing  they have a noise cancel effect  ok  now for my primary complaint  all other factors the_same  i would be very_satisfied_with these headphones if they were only more comfortable  it s strange  too  because on the right ear it s perfect  on the left ear  painful  i have avoided using my galaxy s5 headphones because they aren t so comfortable_to me  but i actually practically retired these ones in favor of those  i_don_t know what it is about my left ear  i_tried switching the medium default tip for the smallest and i_might say that s even less comfortable  i_can_t quite put my finger on it  the speaker hole is narrower   it s an oval  not a circle  giving almost an appearance like the latest iphone headphones  i_thought that would have been perfect  and it is on my right ear  my right ear could probably wear it all day  but my left ear can_t stand it  so  i_know_i have talked most this review about my broken soundbot headphones  but that s only because they are the most comfortable ear buds i have ever found  for me  comfort takes precedence over pretty much all other features  save for price  because_i just can_t stand wearing most ear buds  that said  here is the fib ranking  sound quality  1st 2nd  galaxy s5 and soundbot  tie  3rd  these panasonic headphones 4th  coby comfort  1st  soundbot 2nd  galaxy s5 3rd  these panasonic headphones 4th  coby appearance  1st  these panasonic headphones 2nd  galaxy s5 3rd  coby 4th  soundbot price  1st  these panasonic headphones 2nd  soundbot  by a_few dollars   i_can_t rank the galaxy s5 because they can with my phone and the coby came as part of a set with other headphones  features functionality  1st  galaxy s5  play pause skip phone and volume  2nd  soundbot  play pause skip phone  3rd 4th  these panasonic headphones and coby  tie   no controls  overall  if my left ear wasn_t so sensitive i would probably love these  because_it is so sensitive  i find them almost unusable  otherwise  for the_price_and general quality  i would recommend them for less finicky ears  nearly indestructible wow is all i_can say  these sound good_and fit well  always stay in place  but what impresses me most is the build quality  so to speak  as a daily motorcycle rider i have stuffed numerous ear buds under my full face helmets for years  cords break  the earbud itself will come apart  the small plastic bud covers detach inside the ears  but these  i_ordered two pair last year and lost one pair a_few months after  i_ve been using one pair only for the last several months and they are still going strong with the sound  and the materials used in making them have not been compromised  the cord is all together  the buds intact  they have been yanked  pushed  stepped on  and tied around my phone daily  they have been indestructible  i have worn much more expensive buds in the past and one thing or another has failed so_far as materials and build  but these  well  i just ordered another pair to_replace the black ones lost because_i_use them at work_and the cord blends with my black uniform and gear  however the red ones ordered june 16 of last year or still a ok after almost a year of use  and sometimes abuse  nice  but i_don_t like using them outside of the house because they are     i already own alot of headphone  but i_don_t like using them outside of the house because they are huge and anoying to carry around   sennheiser  akg  especialy my grado those are really ugly   so_i_decided to_buy these small little earbuds  and these panasonic earbuds sound quite good  good bass  clean sound  and they are inexpensive  they fit in your ear nicely  unlike my apple earbuds which fall out_of my ears every 5 seconds  enough pros now to the cons  the cord is really thin and easily get tangle  the jack plug is pretty big and doesn_t fit my iphone case  but i fixed it by cut off a_little bit of rubber around the plug with a knife  and now they fit perfectly  the ultimate bargain  cheap but quality  throw away ear buds  i will never again pay  50 for  top rated   brand name noggin sweets ear buds ever again  these earbuds are the pure utility  throw away and don_t worry sort of ear buds i always wanted but quality is_not sacrificed  i_use my ear buds all the_time  i run and work out with them  sometimes i fall asleep listening to music with them  then of course you get tangled up in them by the_time you wake up   i_ve gotten them stuck on something_in my backpack and gave them a_good yank to free them  basically  a_lot of things you really shouldn t do with ear buds and things i would be horrified to try with earbuds that cost more_than these bad mamba jamas  if you want quality sound  you probably aren t looking_for these and really should be perusing the senheiser and up with the audiophiles  but the sound out_of these is still what i would call  really good   bass is bass and and treble is treble  to anyone who wants versatile  cheap  throw away ear buds  these should be in your shopping cart now  good sound  good comfort  good_price_and if you lose them or tie them in a knot  so be it  the_only con is there is no integrated microphone or audio controls but that is a trade i am more_than willing to accept  these are your basic barebones  ear buds  i_bought two just incase i broke my first set  and after six months  i haven_t opened that second pack yet  best  9 upgrade on earth the earpiece design stays put and is comfortable  and getting a_good seal is fast_and easy  i swapped out the medium tips for the large and they fit perfectly  these buds sound terrific  they are eq ed flat and warm  bass response is solid  assuming a_good seal   highs are tamed  which reduces ear fatigue and facilitates higher listening volumes  bought to_replace the stock buds in our sennheiser wireless in ear monitors  which these kill with ease  i even have a pair of shure se215 s that cost 10x as much  yet sound only about 25  better  and that s when you re done fidgeting with them for 10 minutes to_get them placed properly in your ears for a_good seal  even then  they re nowhere near as comfortable as these  incredible value  make sure you have an air tight fit  after reading all the reviews  i_ordered these and couldn_t wait to hear the awesome sound  which would validate my thrifty nature   read  cheap   when they arrived  i was really disappointed that they sounded so crappy  even though i was aware that an air tight fit was really important  i assumed that my ears would be a  medium  size  so_i_used the medium silicone plugs  i nearly returned them  but on a whim i_tried the large size silicone plugs  wow  what a difference  suddenly my music came alive  they really are amazing for under  10  pros  amazing bass  overall really good sound  super cheap  they stay in my ears while running    they don_t_even come close to falling out now that i am using the large sized silicone plugs  actually quite comfortable  even with the larger plugs  so stupidly cheap  if they die    whatever  cons  red is_not red    it is pink  whatever  i_don_t care  lots of  thudding  noises from running  oh well  no volume controls  really  panasonic  really  what would that cost  it might cost another  0 25  and i_d pay another  5  sounds like a win win  but again  whatever  summary  i just bought another pair  in orange    go beavs   just in case these die  you should  too  
panasonic rphje120k in ear headphone  great once you learn how to wear them i_ve had a love hate relationship with these earbuds until i learned how to properly use them  i_ve had them for a_few weeks now   these are my first pair of in ear earbuds and as many have already said  they are to be worn sealed into the ear canal to_get the proper fidelity  you cannot simply fit them into the opening of the ear and get any bass response at_all  i knew this but didn_t know how you were supposed to_get them inserted properly and i struggled in the absence of any pertinent guidance  i understand that everyone s ears are shaped a_little differently but what i found that worked for me was to insert the bud into the opening of my ear canal and rotate it while applying inward pressure  kind of like turning a screw  until the cable shaft points upwards  see my pic   when the bud is situated this way it slides into my ear canal and makes the appropriate seal and i_can run the cable behind my ear  no amount of inward pressure could get the proper seal with the cables hanging downward like you would think it is intended  it took me a while to figure this out  i also discovered that there is a fine line between pushing it in just enough_to create the seal and pushing it in too far  go too far and they begin to hurt rather quickly    and they hurt pretty bad  so find the spot where they seal but go no further  again  it took me a while to figure this out  when positioned correctly i_can wear them for extended periods  that being said  once fitted correctly   sealed in the ear canal   these buds provide an adequate  quite a_bit actually  amount of bass and sound isolation compared to the regular headphones that simply rest in front of the ear opening  the bass was too much at first  i realized i had my eq settings on my device set to a high bass boost to compensate for my old headphones  once adjusted to flatten out the bass they sounded fantastic  i_ve never had any other high end earbuds to compare these to but i feel that these sound great especially for the_price  they do a_very_good job of keeping out surrounding noise  i_used them on a recent flight and they did a much better job keeping out the_background noise of the jet than my old phones  use caution when walking running as they can block the sound of traffic and other hazards you would otherwise hear  summary  these panasonic in ear earbuds are a_great_value and have exceptional sound    once you learn how to properly use them  experiment to achieve the correct and comfortable fit  they ve worked like a charm i_purchased these headphones approximately 1 1 2 years ago and they still work  when i originally bought them i_needed them as all purpose headphones which i could bring to school  use in the weight room  and use while doing work around the house  for a large portion of the_time_i_ve had them that s exactly what i_ve used them for  and they ve worked like a charm  it is important to note  however  that these headphones are all plastic  so they will take some abuse but will get damaged if the situation gets too rough   i_ll touch on that a_bit more later   for the_price  the sound quality of these in ears is fantastic  when i let a friend use them once  he immediately responded with  whoa   for  10 earbuds the sound is very impressive and probably suitable for most people  these headphones have a balanced sound with enough clarity to deliver the basic framework of whatever music you re listening to  plus a_little bit more  if you re mostly a passive listener and want cheap earbuds you won_t have to worry about if they get lost or stolen  these are a_great_buy  when i eventually upgraded to more expensive earbuds  these ones were able still to hold a candle to the competition  although with further comparison the panasonic s are slightly  blattier  and  fuzzier  than higher quality  more expensive options  on their own  though  these earbuds sound significantly better_than others in their price range  even rivaling some costing around  25  i_used these earbuds as my primary listening medium for about nine months and they withstood a_lot of abuse  every day i would take them to school  usually stuffing them in the smaller pocket of my backpack and carrying them wherever i_went  for a long time  they stood strong  however  i pulled the buds out_of my ears one day and the right side wasn_t all together  in fact  the right speaker had split off from the rest of the earbud s housing  however  the wire to the speaker was still intact and after i gently snapped the two pieces back together  both earbuds worked just the_same  unfortunately  i was long passed the ninety  90  day warranty for the headphones and there was_nothing_i could do to have them fixed  from then on  i have had to be careful when pulling the right bud from my ear  but besides that  nothing else has broken  now  these earbuds have long been replaced by more expensive ones with higher sound quality  currently  i_use them as my main running earbuds  these headphones are good enough_to_get me in the groove  but i wouldn_t be too upset if they broke  so_far  they have managed fairly well despite their earlier injuries and despite being sweated on a_great_deal  they still work just_fine_and sound exactly how they did when i first got them  pros   cheap  sound great_for the_price  reasonably durable  ergo fit  fits very_well in your ears   helps you figure out which side is which  cons   90 day warranty  plastic housing  thin shielding on the main cord the panasonic s also come_with a mic and a pause play button on the cord  it s also_important to mention that these headphones are in ears and fit pretty snugly in your ear  which i think helps block out sound and helps to keep the bud in place  for some people this could be uncomfortable and be a big negative for them  overall  the panasonic rptcm125 s are great sounding headphones for the_price  which you can_take around with you almost anywhere  they will withstand a_lot of abuse but  sadly  are only covered under warranty for the_first three months  recommended for the listener who wants a pair of powerful headphones for cheap  update 7 10 2015  changed my rating to better match my experience with the_product  square covered end of jack excellent sound quality  affordable  comfortable the_only downside is the pictures do_not indicate the jack has a square end cover  which prevents usage in some types of cases  if you are sure the headphones will fit in your phone  these are the_ones for you  they sound better_than some of the  20  sony headphones  too small for me to sleep with but good enough_to_use on a regular basis  they are  8  splurge  update   while i remain positive on these very inexpensive ear buds  and they are still performing  i treat them as being fragile  the wires for instance are pretty light weight  again for the_money  i consider them a_good buy         for under  9 00 these panasonic ergofit in ear earbud headphones were a_great_buy  i have several sets of ear buds  from these  8 ones  to a range of  40 to  100  while i am not sophisticated enough_to compare the specs or sound quality of high end ear buds  for  8 i was_not expecting these to sound as_good as they do  i sleep with a set of small ear buds every night  and use several amazon sleeping apps and albums  i want_to_go to sleep quickly_and to stay asleep  smaller ear buds enable me to sleep on my side  using a pillow  without being conscious of them  i also don_t want_to wake up with irritated ear canals  if_i break an inexpensive set  i would just pick up another  right now_i am using a  40 set  and i_dont want_to toss or turn and break a  40 set  they are just a_little too big for me use on a nightly basis  others may find these are fine to sleep with  i_do use them throughout the week  depending on what i am listening to  or deepening on what i shove in my pocket  my daily range of music includes smooth jazz  classical  blues  country  rock  indie and pop  if_i want a higher quality sound  i reach for a higher quality ear bud  in general these are acceptable  again they are only  8  there are reviews with differing opinions on whether or not they are noise canceling and other commenting about challenges to_get them seated  to have them be noise canceling  i have been fortunate enough_to just be able_to pop them in place and they do cancel out general noise distractions  again  for  8  i would not have to think twice to_buy another set  to keep them handy and to_use when i inevitably misplace any one  or several sets of earbuds at the_same time  consider splurging  best earbud fit yet i_ve found every incarnation of apple s earbuds to be painful and poor fitting  after experimenting with several different 3rd party brands  these panasonics would be at the top of my list  pros  unique asymmetrical bud design fits and stays in better_than anything else i_ve tried  even while working out  the rubbery bud covers  the clearish part that actually sticks in your ear  stays put  other brands  i_ve purchased were always falling off the headphones and getting lost  forcing you to live with the wrong size spares or replace the whole thing  very_good sound  reasonably full range  though maybe a_little boomy vs  tight on the bass end  i_like the angled plugaccidentally yanking the cord pulls to the side and seems less likely to pull the plug straight out  also sticks out less  nice to be able_to_get them in something besides basic black cons   really very minor  wires seem unusually thin  even for earbuds no clip to help keep headphones coiled and less tangled when stored  this is one_of the few things i_like about more recent model apple earbuds  good stuff a_bit of context first  i_don_t buy expensive earphones because_i loose break them relatively frequently  i_use headphones all the_time  i listen to music on my phone daily and also use a set plugged into a bluetooth intercom system on a motorcycle  the latter has speakers  but i prefer using earbuds as they block out the_background wind noise which help protect hearing at the_same time allowing me to listen to music  make calls  talk to other riders and hear gps instructions while i ride  for my purpose  these headphones have been great  better sound than any other headphones i have tried in the   20 price range and good at blocking out background wind noise while i_m riding  with a full face or mx goggles helmet on   the relatively low_profile allows me to put on my helmet without the earbuds popping out_of place and they also stay in securely while running  cycling  etc  while this will depend on the individual ear  these headphones come_with three different sized ear inserts  that are well made and fit securely to the base  like with any earbud  fitment is key both to sound quality and comfort  so your bound to_get a range of reviews   easy tiger   does a_great job of going into detail about proper fitment  so read his review if you are struggling to_get good sound out_of these  i_m very_happy_with the sound  but my expectations are also reasonable considering the fact that these are earbuds  not a  200 pair of over the ear headphones  i_ve have owned more expensive earbuds  but from my recollection  not a side by side comparison   any improvement in quality of sound is marginal  at this point  my one gripe is that the insulation on the jack is to thick for my phone case making it pop out and loose the connection  to remedy this  i carefully trimmed the insulation back about 1mm around the entire jack using a utility knife which solved the_problem  there is no concern about cutting the wire by doing this_as that portion of the jack is still metal  whether or not that will weaken the connection of the wires to the jack remains to be seen  i will update if_i have any troubles  another option is to just make the_case headphone cutout larger  but i have three headphones and one one case  so_i_went this route  i_bought three of these and will by three more when the_time comes  for my use  these are the_best earbuds for the_money that i have tried_to date  good headphones for a small fee these are a_very inexpensive replacement for headphone mic combos that come_with a mobile phone  my primary function for these is gaming on the xbox  no echo with the mic  unless accidentally blasting sound through the tv  and the volume is perfect  bass and treble are average per cheaper cellphone headphones  i recently purchased the hyperx cloud pro gaming headset due to in ear bud discomfort  and there wasn_t a_very large difference in sound quality  the hyperx is definitely more crisp with regards to the tone and carries about the_same in bass  but other_than that     not much better overall  for ten times less i_d recommend the panasonic over more expensive over the ear headphone mic combos  my only gripe is the discomfort of in ear buds over a long duration of use  it must be noted that the shape of the bud is oval  not round  i_don_t believe this makes a large difference in comfort for me  but it may for you  if you want high quality sound from headphones i recommend doing some serious research  if you re reading this  you re already on the path   i_wanted a quick fix to my previous cable ripped headphone mic combo and went with the panasonic  best headphone decision made in a while  great sound and wonderful fit on these earbuds from panasonic at a marvelous price  i have waited a_few weeks to_make sure that these panasonic in ear stereo earbuds are still working well  when i first received them i think the packaging caused them to be kinked up_and i had several issues on the_first three days with the sound automatically getting louder  static sounding in one ear only  and or the sound going_to zero without my touching it at_all  i was happy i had purchased the square trade as_i_thought i would be returning it  however  i am glad i waited and took my time because_i am no longer having any issues_with this_product  i_do have one thing_i want_to point out that the wires on the ear buds are quite thin and for some reason the connection point is l shaped  this can cause you to have the ear buds over the volume control on your fire tablet  i would prefer stronger wires and a straight connection  what i really like about this is the fact that the ear buds are ergonomic and fit in your ear quite well  i_like to_use mine to fall asleep to at night without waking my husband  these are very comfortable and i_like that  you can purchase these in various colors but i_like the basic black which i_got  i_do recommend you purchase the square trade for less_than a dollar  because_if you are anything like me  you really give them a workout  i_use mine mostly when sleeping  so_it is out_of my control on how i treat them  good budget option i_don_t think you can beat these for durability for the_price  i wear these for 3 5 hours a day for commuting and workouts  the_first pair lasted 8 months before the right channel started cutting in and out  this is from the tip wearing out over time which is expected  other models in this price range would fail under heavy use as soon as a_few weeks and certainly within 3 months  the sound quality is_nothing to_get excited about  when they are fit properly in your ears the sound is very mid range heavy almost like an old am radio and they also suppress external sound  i have no idea what the wirecutter is talking about in their review by the_way  for apps with eq i cut the mids and boost the bass and treble to clear up the sound  apps that don_t have eq are muddy and unlistenable  the noise suppression caused cramming an expanding earpice in your ear is disconcerting for phone calls  i find i_can_t hear my own voice and have to_take the left earpiece out to hear myself  still for the_price  this is a solid option  good_deal for the_price  very basic  not for heavy or long time use i suspect  for the_price  this is a_good_deal  while cheaply made with very thin cords and so on  the_price is fantastic  the sound is fine for listening to the news on my laptop while not disturbing others or listening to my voice messages on my phone while maintaining privacy  audiophiles will want something more sophisticated but will pay far more  one thing_i_like about these is that the pin you plug in is at a 90 degree angle so that when i have my laptop on its side it doesn_t stick straight out and i_can scoot the laptop a_little onto the base i keep it on so that the pin doesn_t break off  they come in a blister pack with some printed material and two extra sets of rubber ear pads  one set that is larger than the set that s installed and one set that is smaller than the installed set  there is no case or bag included  i_purchased this after the earbuds included with my s5 phone began to fail after 30 months  including times when i accidentally sat on them and pulled  probably pulling on the wires in the process  plus  the plastic parts started to fall_off  because_i_wanted to_take time to find the_best set of earbuds or earphones to_replace them without going overboard  i_decided to_buy these just so_i could listen privately to things until i had time to research  i_decide i could tuck them into a tiny zippered plastic bag and keep it in my bag for use listening to my phone when out and about and then keep the nicer pair i get after research at home  the_only reason i_m giving this a 3 star rating is that these are flimsy looking and i_don_t expect them to last a long time  for the_price  they are perfectly adequate  this would be a decent set to give to a kid prone to losing things so they can keep them in their backpack  fastest shipping i_ve ever received i_ordered these last night around 11 00pm central time_and they were delivered today  sunday  before noon  what   i_didn_t pay_for shipping  it was a prime item that was_expected to arrive tuesday  i_ve nerv had faster shipping on any item  amazing  anyway  i opened them and have been using them the past two hours to_make sure the sound is good_and i_m very_pleased  everything_is super clear and i_can hear the bass in songs and even small_intricacies that i_must have been missing with my last pair of ear buds  these fit my ears really well_and stay in place  they also come_with two more sizes of gel covers in case the originals don_t fit to your liking  the length of the cord is long  which is nice  i_m very_happy_with the earbuds  update   i removed one_star from this review because the second night i_used these  they stopped working on my tablet  they still work on my phone  but when i try them on my tablet  they won_t work  i_tried another pair on my tablet and those work fine  so_i_know_it must be these headphones  i have no idea why they d work on both devices for a day and then the following day only work on one  i_ve tried several days in a row now_and they still only work on my phone  strange  best budget earphones wirecutter named these the_best budget earbuds years ago  and i_d argue they are still the_best budget earbuds  under  50 in my opinion   the_best rivals to these under the  50 range are earbuds available mostly in china  although they are also on_amazon   ones such as xiaomi and vsonic  however  reliability on those is hit or miss  you don_t want_to spend  40 on a pair of earbuds end up being defective trash  so_in my opinion these panasonics are pretty_good  although it s hard to expect perfect build quality on a  12 item  the pairs that i_ve owned have held up well  the biggest issue will be the lack of strain relief  so the part where the wire connects into the earbud is almost always likely be the cause of the demise of these earbuds  for the_money they are great  if you ve got more of a budget then hifiman  shure  and the dozens of other brands recommended on head fi are the_way to_go  best bang for your buck i_purchased a pair of these in december 2015  and they ve seen daily use at work ever since  office environment   listening to music  podcasts  etc    for the_money  the sound quality is great  and other people can hear me loud and clear using the in line mic for phone calls  the fit in my ears is good enough that they don_t fall out or get tugged out easily  however  the earbuds are now falling apart after about 1 5 years  and i_need_to order a_new pair  for under  15  i_m not complaining   these were  disposable  from day one  and i_ve had  40 earbuds that have crapped out in a shorter amount of_time  plus  my current ones still function  they just came apart at the gray black seam on the right earbud  mostly  i just use the right earbud so_i_can still hear what s going on around me  i_ll try some superglue and see if_i_can keep them around as a backup  but i am ordering another pair of these  my four star rating has more to_do with overall build quality and aesthetics compared to other earbuds i_ve owned over the years  but they had to cut corners somewhere for the_price  pros   price  sound quality  for the_money   fit is just as_good as more expensive earbuds  right angle plug  price  yep  listed twice  cons   build quality   plastic  falling apart after 1 5 years   cord tangles easily love it  these are by far my favorite earbuds  i_ve bought these time_and time again  i keep trying different companies and eventually come back to these  i_use my earbuds all the_time  literally every day  i throw them in my pocket and carry them with me everywhere  so basically what comes in the_box is pretty standard for earbuds  the earbuds themselves  there are three different size ear bud ends  and some paperwork  pros   great sound  fit well in ears  stylish  comfortable cons   don_t last very long   mine lasted on average about 3 months  however  for  6 it s unbeatable  let s go over the earbuds in more detail now  packaging the packaging was_nothing special  just a standard plastic case  the_ones that are a pain in the ass to open  it took me about 2 minutes just to open the_box  however  it s_not the_box  but what s in the_box that matters  build quality build quality wise  these earbuds seemed ok  the wire was fairly thin but unless you where pulling on it  it doesn_t seem like the wire would give way  the 2 earpieces themselves are made of plastic  once again  it doesn_t seem that the plastic would break unless you abuse the crap out_of these earbuds  as for the headphone jack  i_like how instead_of having it go straight it turns  so_if you rest your phone on the jack  it won_t wear off the wire joint  comfort these earbuds are quite comfortable  i wore them for about 5 hours straigh before i started feeling pain on the inside of my ears  i also like how well they actually fit in your ears  they don_t feel like they re hanging out_of you ears  they feel like they are in your ears  so_if you wanted to_go for a jog with these earbuds  i_don_t think it would be a_problem  sound the sound is very_good  it isn_t going_to blow your mind  but they do sound very_good_for the_price  i_use them for listening to music all the_time_and i enjoy every second of it  summary in the end  i would recommend these to anyone  they are good earbuds  i have purchased these earbuds 3 times now  and i will probably be back again soon  if you found this review helpful please click the helpful button  i appreciate it  good_for short term usage i_ordered these in orange and later in purple because panasonic is a decent brand in my opinion  the headphones arrived_in about 7 days in a box neatly coiled and ready for use  also_in the_box were 2 extra pairs of ear bud cover replacements  one pair was the_same size as the_ones that com with the headphones and the_other pair is a_bit smaller  i_m not_sure why considering they re meant for those headphones  i_used these everyday for music while i worked out  i gave these headphones 4 stars because after a_few weeks  one side stopped working  it may have been due to how i coiled them because other_than that  there was no water damage on my part  unless they short out due to heavy use  i_ordered the second pair soon after and one side went out on them as_well  but you get what you pay_for  don_t buy if you want high quality sound summary  these are horrible headphones and i would suggest you look elsewhere  after reading the many great reviews on here  i_decided to give these headphones a try  since_i was traveling and wanted something simple  i_tried_to like these earphones  i even tried the various sized rubber inserts  i adjusted the volume on the various devices i_used it on  overall despite the brand name  these sound like  2 headphones from china  the issues i had were  1  i had to really crank up the volume to_get any kind of decent sound  the_drivers just aren t very sensitive  2  too much midrange and not enough highs and lows  my guess is that the design of these headphones forces sound through a tiny hole that get routed into the ear canal  sound that have the resonant wavelength for this size hole would be amplified  while highs and lows would be attenuated  3  the rubber inserts were uncomfortable  the design forces the inserts deep inside your ear canal  this makes the inside of your ears itch  so_i_don_t think i_can wear these for hours on end  i would prefer the older foam style that fits on the outside of your ear canal  4  audio just sound faint and distant  i never get the feeling that i am right in the action  in conclusion  these are not sennheiser so don_t expect quality  they remind me of some jvc headphones i_got once on an impulse buy because they were cheap  i have owned many fine panasonic products so_i was_initially quite surprised at the low quality  in contrast  my 10 year_old 720p panasonic tv still looks better_than most newer tvs   the_only use i_can imagine for these headphones is if you want something to fall asleep to  like comedy or talk radio but not music  and don_t want_to risk breaking good headphones  due to finding them under you the next morning  then these might suffice  i have broken many good headphones this way  so_i won_t mind when these panasonics headphones break   i_got the white ones  in case it makes any difference  update  i have had this for 5 months now  i_use it almost every day for video editing  mostly voice  sometimes intro music  and falling sleep to internet radio  it has started to grow on me   maybe i have forgotten what good headphones sound like   i rate the sound quality to be adequate to_good  i haven_t really intentionally abusing it    just use it normally  sometimes i find it crushed under me  between me and the bed in the morning  so_far it has been quite sturdy  so upping to 4 stars from original 2  the_one thing that i still do_not like is that it goes deeper into the ear than traditionally earbuds  so sometimes my inner ears gets itchy after prolong use  also  it blocks out more sound that traditional earbuds  due to the compressible rubber inserts  which are quite soft and generally pretty comfortable  this seems by design for noise isolation purposes  so sometimes i have to remove the headphones to have a conversation  or to check to_see if the phone_is really ringing  knocking one_star for these quirks  otherwise pretty_good headphones for the_price  will update again if when it breaks  good enough  but not miracle headphones don_t believe the people who say this has_good bass  i was hoping the people who said otherwise were just being picky  i_m no audiophile  but these have less bass than the  3 xaiomi in ear piston headphones i had last  meaning you can_t feel the bass at_all  but the sound isn_t tinny  i_mostly bought these because people said they re durable  but first impression is  the cord feels thin and cheap  so_i_m not so sure about that  but i_can_t judge  i_ll update my review later with my long term thoughts  the earbuds themselves are reasonably comfortable  and they stay in very snugly  they block out a_lot of noise so you can_t hear surrounding background noise  which is a plus  final thoughts  these are good enough for the_price since_i_needed new headphones quickly  but i_ve gotten much better ones for much cheaper by waiting around for deals to show up      have previously ordered panasonic ergofit earbuds and have always liked the feel and comfort of them so_i_ordered     i have previously ordered panasonic ergofit earbuds and have always liked the feel and comfort of them so_i_ordered these for the microphone  the microphone works pretty well  other people have told me they can hear me clearly but it does pick up movement noise so_i have to try to not move the cord while on the phone  i was hoping there would be volume buttons on the microphone button as_well but there is only one  to answer and end calls  
get the jvc gumy headphones instead    tl dr below     updated review below   i just have to_say wow  i had to spread the word on these guys  i am super impressed with these earbuds  if you told me that i could have a pair of earbuds that sounded great  did_not distort any sound  were comfortable  looked decent  and they were only 8 dollars  i would slap you and call you a liar   i would be severely mistaken however  and arrested   as_i am dead wrong  i had read reviews on a_couple_of different websites that these were the el dorado of earbuds under 50 dollars  some were so brave as to exclaim that these were the_best earbuds under 100 dollars  i then found 33 000 reviews on_amazon with the overwhelming majority saying that these are the_best cheap earbud to_get  these brash claims caught my attention  and as a gadget guru and headphone enthusiast  i had no choice but to succumb to the lavish price of 8 dollars  for those interested in a breakdown  these come_with three sets of eartips  which i had to_play with because_i could not find the right size at first  making sure you have the right size ear tips in is crucial  because_it will form a seal around your ear and you will be able_to isolate and block external noise better  hear the music louder and clearer  and the bass will be more prominent  i have had these for a_week so_far and have used them for a multitude of things  ive watched movies  listened to music while mowing the lawn  these were sufficient at for drowning out most noise   worked out with them  and used them for playing games  the_best things i would recommend them for are for just casually listening to music and watching movies  this is my general test on how good headphones are  play rage against the_machine and see if_i_can get pumped up on the bass  then play i saw her standing there by the beatles and see if_i_can hear george harrison twanging away on his guitar over paul mccartneys overpowering bass  these definitely beat a_lot of over the ear headphones that i own  the sound is balanced and i could hear everything almost exactly like the original audio recording  they also had a reasonable audio level and got as loud as_i_needed them before i hit the highest setting  i would not recommend these for working out  as they just kept falling out_of my ears and distracting me while i was running i also would say that these are not an acceptable headphone for fps or multiplayer gaming  as you really need an over the ear set to amp up all the noise in the game and help give you directional listening  i could not pinpoint footsteps   etc  with these earbuds as_well as with my audio technica and polk headsets  also  you need a decent mic for voice chat and this model does_not have a mic  generally though  these are worth it for everything else mentioned  so  here i am  telling you to_get these  get them now  dont hesitate    tl dr  8 dollar headphones  why you not_buy      product update 08 14 16   5_stars dropped to 3 what am i_doing up at 1247am on a sunday  one may answer that i am at a club having a_great time  or watching a movie with my fiance  or having a sleepover with my family  but the answer to that question is none_of the above  i am awake at this hour as your sworn headphone avenger  to tell you not to_buy these headphones  you should buy these headphones instead  jvc hafx5b gumy plus inner ear headphones  black why  because_i was a_bit over zealous on my initial review  at the_time of writing the original review  i had not found a suitable alternative for a cheap and reasonably decent sounding pair of headphones  but   just like all politicians  at some point when you make a public statement you have to back track when you re mouth was moving faster_than your brain  i_bought the jvc gumy headphones from best buy a_few weeks ago and i was_intending to test them side by side with the panasonic ergofits  i noticed some immediate improvements that the jvcs had over the panasonics  one was that the gummy seals for your ear are a_lot more comfortable  secure  and provide a much better seal than the panasonics did  the next improvement was the mic and control button which the upgraded ergofit has  but you shouldn t go without it   the most important feature that the jvcs have over the panasonic is its performance  when i listened to one more time by daft punk on both headphones  the panasonics were very level all around and there was_nothing spectacular that stood out  when i_used the jvcs  my ears exploded with delight from the much better bass response it had  i have been using the jvcs for everything since then and i haven_t looked back  gone through 2 pairs in 3 months   in middle schooler vs earbud   middle schooler wins     i keep reading how these have held up well_and are good_for  kids    but we ve gone through three pairs   two in the past 3 months alone  so they clearly do_not hold up for us  my daughter uses these in school for spanish labs  and mostly at home to listen to music and video  at home they are left  around  and in school they are placed within her padded chromebook case  so not the most abused ear buds  i_m getting a_little tired of ordering new_ones  so despite the advice in other reviews to  buy in bulk    i_may just buy another brand and see if they last longer  great while they last  2 pairs broke i have purchased 3 pairs of these headphones   the_first without a microphone and then two more with a microphone  the non microphone pair was really great   i_used it for years before it finally gave out  the microphone version seemed just as great_and i_loved being able_to_use them to_make calls  pause and start my music  etc  however  after about a year the plastic piece covering the speaker loosened and detached  i_bought another pair and it only lasted a_few months before the exact same thing happened  i think they must be using less glue or something because the microphone ones are much less sturdy  even though my second pair was still under warranty  i only bought it 2 5 months ago  panasonic refused to_replace them because they were  damaged   panasonic   the damage is because of your faulty design  these are okay  panasonic ergofit in ear earbuds headphones with mic controller rp tcm125 k  black  i am a college student  so_i rely on headphones when i am walking to class or walking around the town  i also love to_use headphones while talking on the phone  so that i_don_t have to hold my phone up to my ear while i am walking  i am a_little disappointed in these headphones mostly because every person i talked to on the phone would hear me echo  this pretty much means that they heard me say the_same thing twice  which confused and distracted the people i was talking to  this was very inconvenient and disappointing to me  as headphones to listen to music youtube podcasts  it works as_intended  no hearing difficulties and the headphones had crisp sound  good design as_well  overall  these were just_fine to_use  but i hated talking to people on the phone with it  so_if you are using these headphones strictly for listening purposes they work great  it s okay  and for someone who keeps breaking much nicer headphones okay is fine  in the last year i_ve broken both audio technica and sennheiser ear buds  i take good care of the big headphones at home  but when i_m on the go i tend to destroy them in no time  so  thanks to the rate at which i_destroy the things  i_decided to stop buying nice earbuds and get ones that won_t matter if_i_destroy them in a_month or two  they probably won_t last long  the cords are really thin and plasticky rather than the thick braided cable that come_with the better units i_ve still managed to break  of course i_can just grab another pair of these when they break and not be sad that i just destroyed an expensive pair of sennheiser earbuds again  the worst thing about these are the really poor earpiece selection  none_of them properly fit my ears leaving me with a high tinny sound and almost zero bass unless i_m wearing a hat that can press the buds into my ears  i_ve read in reviews here that this is due to poor fit  but when none_of the ear pieces actually fit me i_can_t test that out for myself  it s okay  and for the_price it s_not bad at_all  i just need_to_set the eq on my player to be very bass heavy and turn the volume up higher than_i normally would have it  i_ll keep my quality at home where i have nice cans that are safe from being destroyed and take these with me so_i_can still listen to my music but not worry about taking care of my headphones  thought these would be a_good replacement for apple earbuds while there seems_to be a_bit of a larger range soundwise when it comes to music  these actually feel pretty cheap  the cord is thin and does_not feel like it will hold up the abuse my apple earbuds have taken   i even washed my apple ones a time or two when they got left in my pants pocket and they are as_good as new  and clean   also  these panasonics have no volume control which i_thought would be ok but i find it inconvenient to pull out my phone to adjust the volume  especially when i am sitting at work   the microphone seems_to_work well_and the play pause button is convenient however i fear these will become my emergency back up headphones  definitely consider these i_ve purchased many pair of these  pros  excellent sound quality for the_money  i_don_t use a_lot of bass   stay in my ears  many most buds fall out  i have very small ear openings  inexpensive  not a big deal if lost or damaged  cons  and this is the reason for only 3 stars  the microphone_is too sensitive  when i_ve used these with the phone and there is almost any ambient noise  the person on the_other end of the line picks up every sound and i get frequent complaints that they cannot understand me due to the loud background noise  they find it very irritating  doesn_t have volume control   but what do you expect for around  10 12  good_but not great  i just bought these to_replace a set of skull candy ear buds that got wrecked at the gym  these come_with 3 sizes of foam ear piece inserts which i found make a huge difference  the mid size come installed on the buds  took these out_of the package and headed to the gym w o listening first  i hated them  sounded tinny  no bass and i could hear everything around me which i had not experienced w  the skulls  tried the_other inserts and huge difference  counter intuitively  thought the smaller inserts would allow the buds to_go deeper into my ear canal and give me a better sound  wrong  the larger  block out  external noise and  trap  for lack of a better term  the sound in your ear giving more mid base  these are not great but i_don_t hate them the_way i_did at first  still not_sure they are an improvement over the skulls but are close if not equal  not bad i go to the gym  cycle  run  etc   about 5 6 days a_week  so_i go through headphones fairly often  or they end up lost or damaged  i am a_little spoiled as the tj maxx near me sells skully candy head phones for 7 99 that i have been very_happy_with  but it s located in a_very traffic heavy part of town i have not gotten too recently  nor do i want_to around the holidays   so these were close in price_and a name brand  so_i figured i would give them a shot  i first put them in an they sounded kind of trebley and tinny  and i instantly new what the issue was  another review hit it right on the head in a longer explanation   the biggest size of ear buds these come_with don_t seal my ear canal  with the sizes shipped  i could hear way to much of what was going on around me at the gym and not enough bass  that seal you get when when you put them in the ear is when you get more full sound  i swapped just the buds with another set and they actually are not at_all bad  they have a_little odd disc shape thing that sits in your ear to help keep them in  and the work well for my ears  anyway  the weren t going anywhere   which ended up being a_good thing since the buds were too small then again  with buds that fit properly  i_do_not usually have a_problem with them falling out anyway  the_only other thing_i_didn_t like is they have the connector at a right angle  and it s quite bulky and square shaped  it just barely fits into the area allowed for by my iphone case  so_if you have a larger more protective case  as many active people using iphones might  this could be an issue for you  and i think they actually would be a pain for the arm band case i_use for running outdoors   i_guess if_i had been paying 15 20 dollars for head phones  i would be more satisfied_with these for this price  i have definitely paid more for worse  with the proper fit  they really aren t at_all bad  but given the ear buds_not fitting me and to a less extent  the jack being large and right angled  i_don_t think i would order these again  hence the 3 stars  
hard plastic means ear stress i should point out that the sound quality is fine_and the actual appearance of the headphones are quite pleasing  however   the cord is guarded by hard plastic guards right where the earbuds rest between the tragus antitragus   those two bumps of cartilage  this can frequently lead to the ear feeling pressed on or pushed apart unnaturally  in fact  after a_week or so of use my ears had quite enough and began to ache whenever i put them on  unfortunately  i require headphones and didn_t have the_money to_replace them again    regrettably  this has culminated in a rather painful sore on the inner side of my right ear s inner bump  the tragus   since they do_not fit perfectly due to the thick cord guard  they frequently shift about making this even worse  i really wanted to like these  especially aince they re both nice looking and sound good  but if they re causing discomfort i_gotta replace them  again  good_for the kids  or for rough duty bass challenged  with pronounced sibilance  maybe i should give three_stars since they are so cheap but decided two_stars since they are so cheap  i_can live with the bass somewhat lean  omission rather than commission  but the sibilance robs hfs  like cymbals  of their natural timbre  leaving a spitty ssssssssss sssssssssss sssssssssss noise  i admit i_m spoiled by my full sized around the ear planar magnetic cans  good buy_for the kids  or to_use when you don_t want_to risk your good buds  just_fine for talk radio or baseball fans  someone suggested reports of poor bass may be due to_user failure to insert them properly  sorry  no  tonal balance is simply very light  some listeners may mistake sibilance for good detail   just depends to what one_is accustomed  they work  you can hear music with them and they re seven bucks at this time  the latter being their strong point  however  they aren t the worst i_ve heard  just the most affordable  be forgiving and they ll sound okay  
if you get a defective pair  don_t expect any customer_service help and say goodbye to your money i_purchased a pair of these earphones in december 2017 due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews  when they first arrived i was so happy_with the sound quality  comfort level in ear  and their ability to block outside noise  i_use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer  i am by no means rough with them  i store them carefully  i_d had my last pair for 8 years  etc  however  only one month after purchase  the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working  i attempted to_return them through amazon and was_instead told to contact panasonic directly  i_tried numerous times to_use the panasonic website s live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time  no matter what time of day i_tried   i then called their 1 888 support number and the_first thing the automated message warned me was that i risked being charged a  9 99 service fee for help if_i continued with the phone call and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty  given that i_didn_t know_if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty  i opted to just hang up at that point  write off my money spent  and order a second pair  they arrived_on january 25  2018  and again  i was satisfied  less_than two weeks later  while watching a homework video  the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working  i called panasonic again figuring that this time_it had to be covered under some warranty at less_than 2 weeks old  the customer_service rep sent me the e mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs and i later received an e mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones  they stated that i was only allowed to ship the_product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container  that it needed to be certain size of that container  and that i would need_to pay_for tracking and insurance on the_product on top of the shipping  the total amount for shipping cost more_than three pairs of these headphones and they wouldn_t guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to_replace the two broken ones  this is the worst experience i_ve ever had with a purchase from amazon  i was disappointed and frustrated that i could not conduct my return directly through amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the_case on_amazon  but instead had to_do the whole runaround with panasonic  and i still don_t know whether panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs  based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like i_did just get unlucky  twice  with defective pairs  however  if you re one_of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer_service to_make it right  be careful before you deiced to_buy their products  one product has different qualities they have two different qualities from the_same product  i_bought one at the beginning that i was totally satisfied_with the_quality  around a_month later  i_ordered another_one for my brother  it turned out the new_one has a really cheap quality and it doesn_t_work_and have so many issues my brother noticed that_even the call answering button was on the left cord  usually it is on the right cord  so_i checked the panasonic ergofit in ear earbuds headphones with mic controller rp tcm125 w  white  packaging and it turned out the packaging was different from the_first one_i_got  even the_quality of the packaging was a cheap quality packaging  also  same products have different barcode numbers and different model numbers  the cheap quality has an instruction paper that was_in the packaging and most of it was written in chinese  i_m totally disappointed since_i felt that was clearly deception  i_ordered a replacement for the_one_i_got and i_got another_one with the_same good quality  that s where i believe that they are cheating on customers  sound goes in and out 2nd pair broke i_got these yesterday  theres a strip in the wire because the sound goes in and out when i touch it  very_disappointed  ill edit this review if_i_can get a_new set  i_dont feel like dealing with customer support over the phone  i just want what i paid for  and since_i_bought the purple pair  i expect to_get  16 worth  edit  i_bought another pair and they broke instantly  i ended up throwing away two pairs of these things  nothing but junk  seriously awful  please make sure you read the return policy  these headphones are awful  i arrived them broken yesterday with one headphone not playing sound  because of the return policy  i_can not return them  the headphone that does work sounds like it s underwater  product arrived defective  no return allowed i_ve purchased these headphones three times  always have solid sound quality and fit comfortably in my ears  however  was very_disappointed this_product arrived damaged in the packaging  plastic wire covering defective  leaving part of the wires exposed   would have just filed a return but received an error saying this_product cannot be returned  super frustrating that i_m now stuck with a defective product and no way to_get my money back        update  i checked further and sent a  get product support  message to_see if there s an alternative way to_get the_product returned  filled out a quick message  the next page simply includes the manufacturing contact info  1 800 support number  and a link to panasonic s own website  amazon s own link for  more assistance  at the bottom of the page is broken and just shows some code for a relative link  totally unusable  just know_if you get a defective item you re stuck  didn_t_work as they should  was given these as a present   wife bought them based on the overall good reviews  but they didnt work at_all for me  now  to be fair  in ear is_not my favorite style of headphones  but that wasn_t the issue  they were actually fairly comfortable  the issue is the sound isn_t consistent and was terrible  when i could get it to be consistently stay plugged in properly  sound was fairly good  my suspicion is the plug isn_t built properly   any slight movement of the wire  my phone  etc  would cause the sound to be bad   only in one ear  volume would go down  remote wouldn_t work  etc  would go in an out  especially if_i put my phone_in my pocket and was walking  which i often do  i_m pretty sure the plug wasn_t staying in the headphone jack properly   maybe it was too small  i_thought maybe my phone case was doing something  i e  too thick and was  pulling  the cord out   but tried without the_case and had the_same issue  on another note  couldn_t figure out how to_use the remote on the wire to change the volume   maybe i was missing how to_use it for that  but i_m usually pretty_good with this stuff  so pretty sure there wasn_t a way to change the volume with it   if this was the_case  it is a bad design  i really wanted to like these headphones  but at least the pair i have just don_t work like they should  i_m going_to try to_replace these  as_i_m hoping that perhaps i just got a defective pair  hopeful that a_new pair will be better  but not entirely convinced    if a_new pair works better  i plan to update this review  lasted less_than 24 hours had these for exactly one day  suddenly  i could not hear the vocals on my songs  everything else seemed fine  wiggled the wire a_bit  and the vocals came back  combined with the fact that the ear bud sizes are too big  i_m not impressed  the smallest ear buds for this is equivalent to my old pair s medium  considering today s trends  i_may be giving up on wired headphones and going for bluetooth  i_can_t seem to find decent quality control anywhere  which is ridiculous  only good if you use them while staying perfectly still  the sound is fine  too many other problems_with these though  they tangle like crazy  the ear pieces don_t stay in ear well_and keep falling out while i_m running  they give you a_few different sizes  but they are nearly impossible to change out  i have an iphone 6 with a_very slim case  and the port to this won_t stay securely in my phone and slips out  i_guess these would be ok if you put them in and sat perfectly still  but they don_t work for me  looking_for something else  serious cons i_liked them for about an hour    before i knew what i was getting into  for starters forget trying_to_return these  amazon wont let you  ive been trying_to_use these for almost a_month  i_use headphones daily    the sound quality is terrible  the chord is so thin its breaking  these are extremely uncomfortable_to wear for more_than 30 minutes  i_dont know why    cheap obviously  i have sores on the insides of my ears  they make my ears itch  then develop the sores    as a side note  they are made with a material that could cause cancer  hence ive stopped using them and never will again    all the past good reviews are no more  they must have changed their product i_guess    zero noise cancellation  and sound quality is bad and spotting  just dont buy them    just dont  save yourself the hassle    buy something from a store that accepts returns  good luck beware as these are not able_to be returned through amazon if defective  when i first opened these they fit very comfortable in my ears  when i_tried listening to them the sound in the right ear kept shorting out  went to amazon to try to_return them and learned i could not return them even though i had just purchased them a_few days ago  instead i was given the phone number to panasonic customer support  i was disconnected twice from customer support while they tried_to transfer me to the right person  i realize these headphones were only  8 but its the principle of it that they make you jump through all_of these hoops from the manufacturer to_return a defective product  normally amazon returns items quickly with little effort  given all_of the positive reviews of these headphones i am assuming i just got a defective pair  update  i called panasonic to start a return  they told me i would have to ship the  8 earbuds to them first then they would fix them and send them back to me  very_disappointed as_it would cost me at least that much to ship them in the_first place  not a fan of panasonic right now_and surely will never buy any panasonic headphones again  expensive garbage price of product and quality dont match up  the headphones pretty much suck  dont let the brand name or the packageing marketing fool you  stopped fucntioning in less_than two weeks  sound is ok but not great  just more garbage  the pack if two i_bought  9 worked just as_good  lasted just as long  only didnt sound quite as_good_but neither are great  do_not_buy panasonic   just one more example of too big to fail no good   one side broke within 1st week of use  panasonic pulled this_product off the market       and per chat with a panasonic agent this morning       they have totally discontinued making these headphones  but   you are welcome to_return it to them at a warranty handling cost that is equal to the_cost of buying a_new_one       oh yes       we get to pay them twice for replacing their defective headphones  good bye forever panasonic  just one more example of too big to fail  wishing you as much continued success as you deserve for your non handling of an obviously defective product  my son bought these based on the great reviews  when we received them my son bought these based on the great reviews  when we received them  only one_of the earbuds produced sound  and the_other one literally fell apart  very_disappointed in quality  then when we tried_to_return the item  we were automatically directed to panasonic support which is only open during regular business hours  we were not given the option to_return to amazon even though the item was sold by amazon  i am honestly shocked that this doesn_t seem to be a returnable item  i always used to rave about amazon s service and standing behind the_products they sell  i told my son to consider it an  8 lesson in getting what you pay_for  but we expected much better based on other reviews  not good    not good at_all  the packaging for these headphones was literally one_of the_hardest things i_ve had to open so that was slightly annoying  what was really annoying is that the headphones came_with bad wiring so any slight movement caused the sound to cut out  or the sound to become distorted  they aren t usable  also  the package came_with the rubber ear bud replacements    i only received 1 small sized ear bud replacement  not a set   and the small ear buds are the size i_use  not good
